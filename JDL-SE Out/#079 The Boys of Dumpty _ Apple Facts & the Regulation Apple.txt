00:02:20.00 it even if I didn't work for an American company I would be celebrating this

00:02:24.10 because it's just you can't there's only so much turkey you can have shoved in

00:02:29.11 your face without having it it ruins my day

00:02:32.10 lack of cranberry sauce on thanksgiving no mashed potatoes it's like it's

00:02:35.19 [ __ ] ruined there's no replacement do you get it in that can and it like

00:02:40.02 sloughs out no no no no no I'm making my own

00:02:42.17 cranberries yeah you don't make your own cranberry you gotta make make your own

00:02:47.06 what you actually like buy cranberries you buy cranberries you put them in the

00:02:51.05 pan they start popping off I put them in

00:02:53.12 a glass of water you eat them in the bar when you have your five-star meal in my

00:02:58.08 bathtub I'm gonna get a candle for you I'll make you some fresh cranberry sauce

00:03:01.22 it's gonna be a great time you put on your favorite uh Maya you put on your

00:03:06.06 favorite dolphins fight song yeah or maybe it's the Chicago bears if

00:03:09.19 you if you want to support your rookie and you just pop off somebody needs to

00:03:14.05 the coach isn't helping someone needs to support the fields he has no offensive

00:03:18.08 line I got a thing about that too that's talking about stuff not being evergreen

00:03:22.22 first off uh here I'm gonna can I just kind of fro at the top hit a couple of

00:03:26.11 notes just so I can feel like I made some progress on myself please all right

00:03:29.12 number one here's the first thing I wrote down let's all record our farts

00:03:33.10 and then see if we can tell them apart uh I can't do them you can't fart well

00:03:38.04 they're just really quiet they're never I'd have to have a

00:03:41.08 microphone in my colon to get any sound I think here's well I'm I'm not opposed

00:03:46.23 to that uh if we need to do it uh I'm about to do a

00:03:51.01 whole colon thing tomorrow I can pick up some pointers from the doctor about

00:03:54.09 about inserting cameras and [ __ ] uh I think it would be fun we get a bunch

00:03:58.17 everybody farts we just we we label it like with some random names so we don't

00:04:02.05 know who it is and then we mix it up and then we give it to nick or somebody and

00:04:04.10 they well I would like nick to be a part

00:04:06.05 of it actually so we give it to somebody

00:04:09.05 who's like uh outside of the episode and then uh and then uh

00:04:12.17 we listen to it we all see if we can we can get it right I think it could be fun

00:04:16.09 okay uh Gavin if you can't fart that'll in itself will be you'll be easy to

00:04:19.11 figure out because you'll be the one that goes

00:04:22.19 I'll maybe I'll eat like two tins of beans and see what I can work up I knew

00:04:26.17 the fiber one bars I'm telling you get some five or one bars going you'll get a

00:04:30.20 fire oh you'll you'll be gone Eric said good name uh Gavin you didn't get credit

00:04:34.08 for that I I might have missed it what was the name wheel of fortune that's a

00:04:38.12 great oh that is a fortune that is great name wheel of art that's a fantastic I

00:04:42.12 was trying to conjure a fart during the cosmic crisp review the entire time as a

00:04:46.07 protest move and I just couldn't it wasn't you were gonna fart in the middle

00:04:49.12 of us you had apples you're an animal I was no I was trying really hard it was

00:04:53.04 the only thing I could do it's the only weapon I had and I couldn't build it in

00:04:56.12 time the bomb was not ready I should have went in prepared

00:05:00.00 oh you know what I think we should do while the cosmic crisp apples still

00:05:03.14 exist at rt yeah uh I think and then Andrew obviously I actually maybe we

00:05:07.19 should wait till you're able to get one but the day you get a cosmic crisp I

00:05:12.21 think all of us uh nick and Eric included should put a cosmic crisp apple

00:05:17.04 in our fridge in the back and then we all agree to pull it out 365 days

00:05:22.01 later and eat it yep I think it's a good

00:05:24.01 I think we got it we gotta test we gotta

00:05:25.18 test the longevity of the apple it's one of their major bragging points it's one

00:05:29.05 of the major selling points about that apple what about when this winter all of

00:05:32.20 my power goes off for four days what do I do then uh you'll be fine because it's

00:05:36.14 20 degrees outside when your power goes off the apples will be I'll take it out

00:05:39.21 of the fridge and put it outside it'll be fine okay wait a second you're the

00:05:43.18 guy that was giving me [ __ ] about refrigerating my apples did you just ask

00:05:47.04 me what would happen if you were not able to refrigerate an apple is that

00:05:50.15 which is what I'm saying if I'm like 10

00:05:52.12 months is that what just happened am I like fridge locked to it oh so at what

00:05:58.10 point does it become acceptable to like refrigerate an apple according to you

00:06:02.21 no my only point was I don't buy enough apples to need to store them that long

00:06:07.04 yeah I'll just eat them as they're out and it feels weird to eat a cold apple

00:06:10.12 versus a room timber trap yeah I agree but the selling point of that but that's

00:06:15.14 this is the irrespective of Gavin and whatever

00:06:17.19 we agree or disagree with in him the major selling point of the cosmic crisp

00:06:20.21 is that it lasts up to a year in the fridge so I want to see that I think we

00:06:25.05 need to test it I agree no I completely agree I think it's great

00:06:28.03 so today the day you get your hand on uh the day you get your hand on a cosmic

00:06:32.17 crystal let us know and we'll figure it out on this end I just really want to

00:06:36.08 find out if the uh the eight rate the rating stands for an apple you've eaten

00:06:41.20 yeah I do too we'll find out I'm let me see if I can I'll check right now

00:06:47.03 I don't think I'll be able to order one but there's a website it doesn't matter

00:06:52.02 anyway continue sorry what other notes do you have uh man I got so much I

00:06:57.22 realized uh we had uh a comment leaver regulation listener named ben Davis

00:07:03.22 uh who's really awesome he he's very uh communicative on social

00:07:07.06 who made a really cool uh action figure of me in a port a potty that I want to

00:07:11.11 show you guys at some point that I think I should have talked about last episode

00:07:14.19 it's amazing [ __ ] you've seen a little bit of it that's really cool I

00:07:19.12 also wanted to show you guys I got a really really cool baseball card

00:07:24.13 out of a random ass drop the other day and I was so blown away by it that I had

00:07:29.07 I have to I wanted to show you guys immediately but I figured it'd be better

00:07:32.17 to do it on camera this this is a baseball card I legit

00:07:34.22 pulled from a pack I bought at a baseball card shop the other day didn't

00:07:37.20 know this card existed it's cool oh the boy is the zimmer the boys of zimmer

00:07:42.21 it's uh Ryan Sandberg Andre Dawson and Greg

00:07:46.04 Maddox these would have been Chicago cubs like in the probably 19901991

00:07:51.12 and uh I uh I was so blown away I thought it would

00:07:55.22 be fun for us we need to remake this baseball card

00:08:00.03 with us and sell it as a poster which one would you be

00:08:04.08 Geoff you'd have to be in the middle I think I would like to be Andre Dawson if

00:08:08.21 I'm being honest with you he is all those guys are hall of famers but

00:08:12.06 Andre dawson's the coolest [ __ ]

00:08:14.07 and he's got a cool pose I want a bat I want to hold the bat all right andrew's

00:08:18.00 the bat andrew's I'm Greg Maddox and I'm just holding my

00:08:21.18 hand looking looking looks like you hold your dick dude

00:08:28.13 what you're doing is you're covering your phone you have just received a text

00:08:32.18 from Geoff and you're affectionately looking at how great the text was that's

00:08:38.06 what that's what I'm doing I'm really excited to respond anyway

00:08:41.19 just a little thing but [ __ ] very very cool I thought that I would share

00:08:46.03 that with you guys don zimmer continues to make his presence known in our lives

00:08:51.17 weekly it's despite the fact that the man is dead

00:08:55.16 did he coach all three of them uh I guess he must have yeah what what a weird

00:09:01.07 what did he coach no he coached two of them and one of them never met him it's

00:09:05.00 the boys and simmer card what are you [ __ ] talking about maybe the dumbest

00:09:08.17 question I've ever heard two of them were his players it was just a zimmer

00:09:13.07 fan no but it might be like they're an organization

00:09:16.17 oh yeah the baseball team the zimmers everyone's favorite these are the boys

00:09:22.06 do you think these are his sons Gavin like what do you what a [ __ ] what are

00:09:27.22 you asking did they play for him or what did you say did you was a player

00:09:33.07 even know did they know him had they met don zimmer [ __ ] boys the zimmer card

00:09:38.15 so you're putting up their top three dumbest questions on the Facebook cast

00:09:42.19 do you think uh I'm not saying overall I'm saying it's one of the dumbest

00:09:46.09 questions I've ever heard you ask I'm just surprised his face isn't on there

00:09:50.17 that's that's mainly it I'm just like well he's not a boy of himself

00:09:55.18 why would he be on the he's these are the boys of zimmer boys of me

00:10:00.20 they're not his sons what the [ __ ] like it's a teletub you

00:10:04.12 want [ __ ] zimmer's head in the top right just looking down on them like

00:10:07.17 what do you want where's zimmer in this car it's just expecting a lot it's

00:10:11.05 expecting every single person who sees that to know who don zimmer is sure

00:10:16.02 but like what are you I don't I'm so I don't know how to reply to that I got

00:10:21.02 so many issues with that statement I don't know where to begin you're buying

00:10:24.15 baseball cards in the world of baseball don zimmer is so famous that simply

00:10:29.12 putting the boys of zimmer on a card instantly every baseball fan on earth

00:10:33.14 knows who they're talking about I don't think there's a single person Gavin who

00:10:38.19 knows who the guys on the card are who would then not know who zimmer is it's

00:10:43.05 like it's like a baseball card

00:10:46.19 [ __ ] Facebook card that just said the boys of baker it was a picture of three

00:10:51.22 hands if it was dusty baker that would make sense

00:10:57.11 would it well if it was three uh Houston astros I guess okay

00:11:03.03 but they were called the it was a whole I think you're taking the boy thing is

00:11:08.11 where it's really thrown you Gavin it's like that's what they were called it was

00:11:12.02 the boys the zimmer the whole team was because the tape that vhs that

00:11:15.10 we're going to watch isn't that called like the boys of zimmer as well I think

00:11:18.13 so yeah I believe it was it's like a play off the boys of summer right yeah

00:11:23.04 other little one I just threw up it's just a picture of a humpty dumpty that I

00:11:26.05 ran into when I was in Detroit I had a whole apple weekend I kind of covered it

00:11:30.09 in the the regu the supplemental episode so I don't need to go through it again

00:11:33.13 but I couldn't remember if I shared that creepy ass uh

00:11:38.00 [ __ ] humpty dumpty with y'all or not but uh it I it definitely stuck out to

00:11:43.06 me once again humpty dumpty also don zimmer humpty dumpty they're everywhere

00:11:47.10 in the world you just don't realize it till you open your eyes see that that

00:11:50.22 would make sense the boys of dumpty and three eggs everyone

00:12:00.02 what's wrong Eric what don't you get the boys of dumpty well it's the same

00:12:05.18 format I don't know it's a gorgeous guess you just got back today

00:12:16.13 the boys dumpty that hadn't been away.

00:12:24.04 Jesus and I'd also be wondering their connection to dumpty himself [Laughter]

00:12:31.18 like were they were they in the same packet of eggs were they also cannons

00:12:37.15 yeah were they were they muskets that's that's where my confusion is

00:12:42.12 because we talked about how humpty dumpty wasn't necessarily an egg and so

00:12:47.12 look at that it would be an egg but then he wouldn't

00:12:51.16 be on there as an egg but we know he's a cannon so it's just three eggs and it

00:12:56.17 says boys of dumpty [Laughter]

00:13:04.13 I just don't think it's a strong format oh I agree

00:13:10.23 if it said if the first thing we saw was boys of dumpty and three eggs I would

00:13:17.05 say this format's incredibly weak [Laughter]

00:13:24.23 this is so funny I feel bad for the I feel bad about the last episode oh.

00:13:32.23 [Laughter]

00:13:36.13 Did somebody have to sit the eggs down did someone have to sit the boys down

00:13:42.05 and explain what after the humpty tragic accident we tried

00:13:48.12 we could not put it back history oh I'm also deeply alarmed by the slushy

00:13:55.22 flavors in that photo what the [ __ ] is a blue razz

00:13:59.14 what is a blue razz well blue slushies are raspberry flavor aren't they but

00:14:05.09 what it's like the universal slushy color for a raspberry to differentiate

00:14:10.19 from strawbs really I think so okay well like a blue slush

00:14:14.17 puppy I never would associate that as like a raspberry huh you wouldn't no

00:14:21.05 it's just blue it just tastes blue taste I mean you know it's all based on

00:14:26.04 a fruit right what fruit would you think I would assume blueberry

00:14:30.17 if you're going blue like typically you make the color

00:14:34.06 match the fruit that it is not the other

00:14:37.15 way but does anyone really on the tip of their tongue know what a blueberry

00:14:41.14 flavor tastes like yeah I love blueberry what are you talking about I'm a big

00:14:45.18 blueberry fan too it is a it's up there I mean I'm a fan I like this I like the

00:14:49.03 flavor it's just not you don't pluck you can't like pluck it from memory as easy

00:14:52.19 as a strawberry I don't even know what you're saying at that point

00:15:10.13 like what is a dragon fruit taste like I've never had one never tasted it okay

00:15:15.18 uh bad exactly uh there's not a single fruit that I've had

00:15:20.08 that I couldn't like remember what it tasted like really yeah

00:15:25.01 kind I I think I'm with Andrew on that one yeah oh [ __ ]

00:15:29.20 you have fruit forgetfulness it's only a little bit like if you if I

00:15:33.14 ate one I'd be like that's definitely a blueberry like if I ate one blindfold

00:15:38.02 right you would you would recognize it if I

00:15:40.06 drank blueberry flavor I don't think oh I didn't mean to send the sorry continue

00:15:45.07 so okay Gavin if we're doing if we're making a poster that said the boys of

00:15:50.17 berries what berries are you putting on what are the three

00:15:54.17 what are your berry types um well strawberry and raspberry are in and

00:15:59.12 probably banana a banana is a berry I remember that was

00:16:03.00 a crazy banana is still chalky I will stand to that it is a chalky texture you

00:16:08.02 got bad banana memory you don't even have fruit memory I can't

00:16:12.19 trust anything that you say about what fruit tastes like you don't remember

00:16:16.03 they're not chalky chalky wasps chalky to me it's like almost like powdery in

00:16:21.01 in terms of texture and taste I don't know I'm just I'm telling you I'm

00:16:25.18 telling you how it is and I think it's the

00:16:27.15 I think is the highest highest ranked halo infinite player here I think my

00:16:32.06 opinion stands above yours what are you gold for as

00:16:36.10 a diamond as a diamond one okay I don't wanna your your fruit opinions are wrong

00:16:42.02 and I will hold to this what's the correlation between fruit and

00:16:45.09 halo oh it's just rank you know Geoff if you brought up it's a military ranking

00:16:49.09 in the past I just feel like I I hold a higher standing in an argument I could

00:16:53.15 just all pull rank I'll pull halo rank regardless of how relevant it is oh halo

00:16:58.10 rank you got to be careful of that because

00:17:00.16 Gavin could get himself promoted real quickly there's no way Gavin's ever

00:17:05.11 gonna pass me in halo rick there's a zero percent chance it could happen I

00:17:08.16 could play with some good people I don't know about that maybe some of

00:17:13.15 Geoff's new friends yeah wait till I find my new friends you

00:17:16.20 can play with them then they won't be my

00:17:17.14 friends anymore they'll leave me for you hey do you want to play halo tonight uh

00:17:21.22 yeah with you yeah yeah Andrew are we doing ranked or like

00:17:26.06 what are we what are we doing

00:17:32.02 right face place halo I like that I like that

00:17:36.08 one thing I would like to add uh before we move on just because he he did such a

00:17:41.01 great job with it I just I wanted to send this poster or this picture of the

00:17:45.09 accessories been made to go along with this action figure including a an iced

00:17:50.00 coffee four different hands so that I can have

00:17:53.07 different hand articulations a butterfly net

00:20:10.02 well I'll tell you something else Kevin our artists are are an interesting bunch

00:20:15.01 did you know that this is years and years and years ago at the day job we

00:20:20.19 had an online comic called rt comics and

00:20:23.12 uh another Canadian guy named Luke McKay uh he drew it and then my ex-wife wrote

00:20:28.12 the comics and uh Luke would draw us it was all the rt

00:20:32.00 characters and like you know whatever scenarios that she wrote for them he

00:20:36.02 drew our dicks under every pair of pants every time he drew anybody from our

00:20:40.09 company he drew a dick before he put the pants on he showed me in Photoshop

00:20:44.01 layers he's like when I put the books together you know because we had like

00:20:47.03 five books he would show me he'd be like hey you wanna see your dick there it is

00:20:50.06 every [ __ ] time he drew any of us from the

00:20:52.05 from the knees up they had a dick the entire time how was the detail it was a

00:20:58.00 commissioner with the rest of uh his art you know similar

00:21:00.17 in vain in style that's interesting I can't wait for jack to look at these

00:21:05.11 images without context that's gonna be a good one

00:21:08.15 we should start we should start um having jack record like one minute

00:21:13.22 summaries of the episodes but he hasn't listened to them

00:21:18.02 and put them as like next week on face oh

00:21:21.01 oh how about this do you guys think we need some sort of a hand signal or

00:21:25.20 handshake because I came up with one well yeah I feel like that was yeah we

00:21:30.15 talked about that right like we're gonna did we went the next yeah that was the

00:21:34.09 whole thing we discussed when did we discuss that that was like two episodes

00:21:38.05 ago like around the dusty baker thing which kind of led into the high five

00:21:42.09 different things of like a long distance and new version of it I guess that must

00:21:45.20 have been why it was rattling around in the back of my head and I but I it hit

00:21:49.06 me the other day I I think I came up with something we asked people to send

00:21:52.21 them okay well I came up with one of my own

00:21:55.07 did anybody send any uh yeah there was one that I think was like called the

00:21:59.05 belly flop or something or it was like both hands downward I want to say this

00:22:03.10 is a few weeks ago at this point so it's not clear it's not fresh in my mind

00:22:07.18 but I'm excited to see yours nothing of note I think I'm gonna film it right now

00:22:11.12 just because it's easier to show you guys so let me put my video I'm gonna

00:22:15.07 record we starts with a baseball baseball bat choke up swing into an apple

00:22:21.12 and then you take a bite out of it it sounds like you're just doing a tic toc

00:22:25.16 dance no no I feel like I just heard a tick tock dance there's no dancing going

00:22:31.07 on uh let me just can I get that up on the

00:22:34.00 let's watch this be too big for discord it's gonna be too big for this one so

00:22:38.08 I'm holding my hands like I'm holding a bat

00:22:41.16 is that phase one yeah phase one is the bat okay so

00:22:45.10 are both people doing this or is one hand of each person

00:22:48.22 no you just do it when you see somebody yeah all right I'm gonna watch this now

00:22:53.22 I know where's the high five part there is no high five what are we

00:22:58.01 what was the what was that well it was it was a hand signal okay a hand signal

00:23:02.08 got it yeah I didn't say anything about a high five I decided that we need like

00:23:05.09 a handshake or a signal you know maybe if you do that into a crowd of people

00:23:08.16 and anyone does it back they know that you're a facer they know that you're a

00:23:12.22 regulation listener like nba players when they when they go out onto the

00:23:16.05 court they do like 75 different wacky hand signs like handshake thing and they

00:23:19.16 like touch their toe and then touch their elbows and do a cool thing I

00:23:22.14 thought it'd be cool if we had our own version of it okay and I think it hits

00:23:26.00 baseball because we used to be a baseball podcast and then it hits apples

00:23:29.01 because we are an apple podcast and I like that it's like it's a combination

00:23:32.02 of the old and the new I feel like it's a universal sign if

00:23:35.15 you're a boy a zimmer or not you gotta be careful it's that like the only area

00:23:39.17 you gotta worry about is when you're making the apple sign with your hands

00:23:43.05 you gotta be careful you're not making one of those anime hearts that everybody

00:23:44.19 loves to do because it's not it's an apple we're not taking a bite out of a

00:23:48.20 heart oh I just don't think I've ever taken a

00:23:52.05 bite out of an apple that I'm holding with both hands.

00:23:57.09 I need both hands to make the apple the representation of the apple why do

00:24:02.15 you have to be difficult do you yeah I feel like you could otherwise you

00:24:07.13 just have an apple with one hand I feel like you gotta like pretend that you're

00:24:10.16 like rubbing it off on your shirt and then no no no oh well now that's

00:24:14.08 interesting rubbing it off on your shoulder is interesting I do think

00:24:17.06 though if you you you so you start with part one to swing you swing that if any

00:24:20.15 of you just come with one hand and you make like a half circle it just looks

00:24:23.22 like you're taking a you've got a baseball now because you've just hit

00:24:26.21 something with a baseball bat I think the apple sells it so you're saying that

00:24:29.21 the second hand differentiates a baseball from an apple yes the

00:24:33.17 second-hand difference differentiates a baseball from an apple thank you I will

00:24:37.07 say better than that I think if you just show a photo of to people of you doing

00:24:41.05 your apple gesture I don't know how many of them would say that you're making an

00:24:44.07 apple with your hands well that's because it's designed to be viewed

00:24:47.23 fluidly as a video it's not a stat it's not a static thing you have an apple

00:24:52.03 shirt on I do have an apple shirt on yeah so have you been more into apples

00:24:55.19 or cider like what was that trip mainly about was it about I guess you're not

00:24:59.09 drinking like alcoholic cider no that trip was it was my yearly apple trip uh

00:25:03.19 and it's it's honestly it's about two things it's well three things it's about

00:25:09.14 cider fresh hot cider on a cold day it's about uh apple cinnamon donuts like

00:25:14.15 these hot apple cinnamon donuts you get in in Michigan

00:25:18.15 and and it's about uh apple sliced apples with caramel drizzled on it and

00:25:23.07 nuts that's what I always get when I go those are like the big three things but

00:25:26.23 it's like it's like an apple orgy dude Andrew would lose his [ __ ] mind it's

00:25:32.13 it's insane it would be like shangri-la outside

00:25:35.00 outside of Detroit yeah like in gross point that area yeah there's apples

00:25:38.05 there's cider mills everywhere and it's like apples for days huh yeah it's

00:25:42.13 really cool that's where I got the shirt from could I is there like hmm

00:25:47.12 is there like a days of summer type thing but with apples just touring like

00:25:51.21 different parts of the us getting the apples as they ripen across

00:25:55.22 the season I think that's a great idea maybe that's like a journey I go on

00:26:00.07 fully embrace the apple lifestyle I think there's a lot you could learn from

00:26:03.20 it like for instance I have a bunch of apple facts I could throw out oh I'd

00:26:08.03 love an apple fact did you know that apples are the second most valuable

00:26:12.19 fruit in the united states oranges are the first these are um there

00:26:16.11 were a bunch of apple signs and I just took pictures of all of them at the

00:26:19.12 cider mill so I could sounds like a top tier fruit johnny appleseed Chapman

00:26:23.10 brought a small variety of apples from Europe he spent his life planting apple

00:26:27.03 trees across america who cares uh don't care about him uh here we go the most

00:26:31.08 beautiful apples are known to grow in the state of what

00:26:34.20 the most beautiful we're talking just apple beautiful

00:26:37.22 where are the most beautiful there's a little bit of apple trivia for you Maine

00:26:41.15 all right that gavin's answer is Maine Andrew where do you think the most

00:26:45.16 beautiful apples in america have been uh uh

00:26:48.06 let's I'm gonna I'm gonna say they're gonna keep it they're gonna it's a

00:26:51.12 humble brag they're bragging about themselves I'm going to say Michigan

00:26:55.03 Michigan all right and Eric your answer is Washington nick do you ever you have

00:26:58.15 do you want to weigh in here do you care I mean Washington have like the

00:27:01.21 the organization don't they the answer is Washington yeah the most beautiful

00:27:05.09 apples are known to grow in the state of Washington however the most flavorful

00:27:09.22 are in the eastern states while Washington ranks number one in producing

00:27:13.10 apples in the united states at nearly 60

00:27:16.06 percent new york believe it or not is number two at 11

00:27:19.13 Michigan is a distant third with eight percent cosmic crisp apple is from

00:27:24.12 Washington that is that is correct Eric was asking

00:27:27.17 it is the Washington apple those are my apple facts I learned that like the

00:27:32.12 granny smith apple was made accidentally learned that the other day one was just

00:27:36.05 like throwing apples at her window and accidentally made the granny smith apple

00:27:40.09 wait what the the inventor of the granny

00:27:42.19 smith apple accidentally made it she was throwing crab apples out her window and

00:27:47.23 they lived on like an orchard and it just happened to mix with a different

00:27:52.13 type of apple and it created the the granny smith apple complete accident

00:27:58.04 that brings up a question I have what's so funny about that Gavin she

00:28:02.23 died two years later she never even got to live in the world of the granny smith

00:28:06.20 apple does she the last name smith uh it was it was her husband's last name and

00:28:11.16 they both died two years later and then somebody bought the orchard and was like

00:28:15.02 I'll just call him granny smith apples and then they became super famous what a

00:28:19.08 s what a sweet homage yeah if they didn't realize what they'd come

00:28:23.11 up with though why would it be a memorable story what do you mean

00:28:28.10 what are you asking sorry yeah where are you

00:28:31.12 did they know the success of the apple it was okay so

00:28:34.04 she made the app she would like make apples and apple pies and like sell them

00:28:38.14 and then she made this apple that was like holy [ __ ] this is a good apple

00:28:42.12 people like this apple it's a great baking apple she had some success with

00:28:46.04 it and she had somebody come in and like characterize and be like yeah this is a

00:28:50.08 new species of apple she started growing it then she died then her husband died

00:28:55.05 like shortly after and then somebody just bought the orchard and just mass

00:28:59.12 produced them so she never got yeah like

00:29:01.15 the person that created the granny smith apple has no real awareness of how

00:29:05.13 popular it became it didn't become like a huge success until after the guy

00:29:10.00 bought everything so what if we just took every single known apple

00:29:14.00 and had like a big food fight with a hundred people throwing these apples

00:29:18.04 would we potentially make an apple in the middle somewhere

00:29:23.05 I don't not oh this is such this is where I wanted to take this that is

00:29:26.13 phenomenal Gavin that's a great idea I want us to make our own apple okay

00:29:31.09 why not why not this is this is there was a note

00:29:34.15 I had written down and I I'm here I'm seeing you birth the idea in front of me

00:29:39.04 that's exactly what we need to do I think we could do a little with a little

00:29:42.15 bit more intent but I love the random nature of it but like the cosmic crisp

00:29:47.11 was invented in our lifetimes so why can't we invent the facer or whatever we

00:29:52.19 call it the regulation apple regulation apple oh it's like it was meant to be

00:29:58.19 a regulation apple that's what everybody needs then you know out the gate what

00:30:03.20 you're getting oh we've got to invent it oh we have to invent an apple that's

00:30:09.06 regulation so what what are the uh requirements for cross breeding do we

00:30:14.21 need do we need like one seed from one like how does an apple

00:30:18.07 how does an apple make a baby I feel like I don't for what it sounds like we

00:30:22.20 just need a viable window we just need a good window to throw some apples out of

00:30:26.23 are we going to get into splicing I think you have to splice it I mean

00:30:31.18 granny smith didn't and granny smith did not splice

00:30:35.07 she sounded like she just had a lawn full of rot that made an apple yeah

00:30:39.08 it sounded like granny smith's backyard trash can just yielded unexpected

00:30:44.19 results anyway well we'll look into it right

00:30:47.05 yeah I don't know how to make an apple but I think we could invent one and then

00:30:51.06 when we invent our own apple here's where we go with it right so we invent

00:30:54.21 the apple takes the nation by storm eventually the

00:30:57.20 world hopefully then we follow up with it we're already working on in the

00:31:01.05 background because it's gonna take a while then we follow up with our boom

00:31:04.16 our [ __ ] our badass hot cider whatever that is regulation cider and

00:31:09.05 that's people love cider great on a cold day you can we can make some people can

00:31:13.22 mix booze with it if they're into that thing uh I I see a lot of potential for

00:31:17.23 us I I apologize if we've already covered it I feel like we led into this

00:31:21.15 episode and then haven't actually touched on the thing you wanted to

00:31:25.06 create an unscrumpable bag I feel like this also ties into that well yeah

00:31:29.20 that's why I asked earlier before I dumped into that all right do van and I

00:31:33.09 said are we going to continue with apples or should I peel it back

00:31:36.12 get it peel it back should I peel it back because uh because I don't want to

00:31:40.12 dump a lot of energy into in on the apple front if it's not a direction that

00:31:44.05 the podcast is headed you know I don't want to just like no I don't want to sit

00:31:47.15 and retread old ground uh because there's a whole world of apples out

00:31:51.07 there I was not aware of do you guys know those black apples

00:31:54.07 I've never heard of a black apple yeah let me find I also saw people

00:31:57.17 posting pictures of uh of an apple that's like red on the

00:32:02.00 inside it's like pinkish I didn't see that

00:32:04.14 I want to try that one that looks good I

00:32:06.15 also want to try it yeah look at this oh this could freak out it's a little

00:32:10.10 freaky interest oh that's apple watch uh here we go copy this is called

00:32:16.02 waiting for Geoff to just send his action

00:32:19.02 figure dick again I'm not like I'm not I don't know

00:32:22.01 I warned you I was sending you my action figure dick I didn't just throw it I

00:32:26.03 unannounced okay uh boom there you go that's what a black diamond apple looks

00:32:31.11 like costs about seven bucks an apple they're expensive

00:32:34.14 it looks like you're looking into space it looks like you're looking into space

00:32:39.07 should we should we have a rare apple taste well we're gonna need

00:32:43.13 we're gonna need apple experience if we're gonna invent the next apple yeah

00:32:48.23 like what if our apple was black also it could be it really could be it would

00:32:54.13 match our color palette for the podcast that's an excellent point oh

00:32:59.01 I wonder if anybody's ever been able to design an apple that you that that has

00:33:04.07 the logo branded in it

00:33:06.15 like could we could we grow an apple that already says regulation apple on it

00:33:14.06 if you grow an apple that knows English

00:33:20.10 it's a pr well I don't know much about apples yet

00:33:24.23 but uh I like I like the black diamond apple so far

00:33:28.15 yeah it's beautiful it looks like a looks like a galaxy kind of

00:33:32.05 anyway there's a whole world of apples out there if that's the direction we

00:33:35.05 want to continue down if we've already you know if we've already beaten the

00:33:38.15 audience over the head with apples for too much then I don't want to do it but

00:33:41.19 uh I I think that there's a lot of potential maybe it's something to like

00:33:45.19 come back to yeah I think we got to go into the lab I feel like we could

00:33:50.01 definitely make if we if we got Eric to get a selection of maybe six rare apples

00:33:55.00 in a nice foam case again and we'll have Andrew watch we could definitely do a

00:33:59.03 nice new tasting give our reviews of each one that's a

00:34:02.12 great idea Eric says already working on it what's a great idea I think I could

00:34:08.12 buy some black apple seeds hmm you don't have to grow the freaking

00:34:11.21 tree every time well it's just I can't see anywhere else to get this apple I

00:34:17.09 don't want this app I already said I'll fly you here I used Betty white's money

00:34:22.15 we got 600 and we got about 650 bucks after tax that's true burning a hole in

00:34:26.22 our pocket.

00:34:28.17 I really want to win the Betty white contest I want you to

00:34:33.02 it's already over now by the time this comes out it is it would be known if we

00:38:51.10 can I tell you guys a funny embarrassing thing that happened

00:38:56.06 to me zip out your bike uh it well sort of yeah so I got bike

00:38:59.21 problems uh all again all three of my bikes are down uh

00:39:03.12 actually my bike is back up but it's been a whole thing uh I'm in I'm

00:39:06.11 currently in the market I'm currently shopping for new for a new bike right now

00:39:10.17 uh but yesterday I did go for a bike ride and I've been having a problem with

00:39:15.19 uh with you know I guess like butt rash sore

00:39:19.02 butt from riding my bike too much it's a common thing and to combat it some

00:39:22.17 audience members recommended I buy some of those I don't know what they're

00:39:25.22 called but those little bike shorts that

00:39:28.06 it's like a diaper sort of but it's like padding on your butt like it's around

00:39:30.04 your like your gooch and your butt but it makes you have like a big dumpy

00:39:34.08 bubble butt the other day yeah yeah so I bought a couple pair and

00:39:39.03 they're great they actually work very well and so I wear them every time I go

00:39:44.02 on a bike ride and the other day I came home

00:39:46.00 and uh like as I was coming home like the mailman was there and I needed to

00:39:49.12 sign for something and then the dog needed to go to the bathroom and then I

00:39:53.09 realized like oh [ __ ] I need to go buy

00:39:53.09 uh some stuff for the to prepare for the colonoscopy I needed to buy some like a

00:39:57.21 laxative that I didn't have yet and I was like oh [ __ ] I just got my keys and

00:40:00.22 I ran to the store and I was standing in line at the grocery store with like me

00:40:04.14 and like I don't know like seven or eight like ladies that are just doing

00:40:08.21 their daily shopping and I noticed one lady kind of giving me

00:40:13.11 a dirty look and I'm used to it right like I get it

00:40:16.12 I get it you know I did somebody wrote I saw I recently did the rt podcast and

00:40:21.20 somebody said I look like a I do meth at a gas station so it's like

00:40:26.03 I I get it you know uh and I'm covered in tattoos and stuff so I am used to

00:40:31.05 getting like weird looks but then another lady gave me kind of a weird

00:40:34.02 look and I thought that's weird because this is Austin and this is my grocery

00:40:37.03 store I you know I come here all the time and then I realized when I moved oh

00:40:41.01 I've got my dumpy underwear on and I looked behind me and I just looked like

00:40:46.00 I was walking around with a [ __ ] like I had taken seven shits in my pants

00:40:50.02 it was just like I had a hanging dumpy [ __ ] and they were just and it was

00:40:54.09 very noticeable and I had completely forgotten that I was still wearing him

00:40:58.10 because normally I take him off immediately

00:41:01.02 uh and uh yeah so I uh I was I was a little embarrassed for that yeah I can't

00:41:05.04 believe you're wearing those that must be quite a contrast to all the tattoos I

00:41:09.14 feel like you've you've actually moved over from person

00:41:12.21 who rides a bike to a cyclist oh well here's the thing I definitely am not a

00:41:17.01 cyclist I was wearing them Gavin under my pants that's the thing I'm not gonna

00:41:21.08 wear them just just the shorts and look like a bicyclist [ __ ] no I was

00:41:25.08 wearing them under a pair of pants which is what made it look extra dumpy it's

00:41:28.20 like if I was just wearing the cycling shorts then they would have looked at me

00:41:32.19 and said oh he's a cyclist he's just he's just gross what they saw

00:41:36.03 was that guy took a bunch of shits in his actual normal pants and it's just

00:41:41.16 hanging you know it's just all like gathering at the bottom and it looks like

00:41:46.08 it looked like my butt was melting I so it's what how do they they have more

00:41:51.15 padding is that how they're helpful to you yeah they have and they've solved

00:41:55.17 they've solved the problem would you say it's a more effective solution than

00:41:59.06 covering your ass and tiger bomb yes yes okay as long as we've moved

00:42:03.15 forward from there yes we're not gonna do that again we've uh we've definitely

00:42:07.09 uh we've learned we've learned some lessons there that will that will not be

00:42:11.16 happening again uh I don't even know like I have

00:42:14.23 for a guy who rides his bike seven days six or seven days a week I think I've

00:42:19.05 ridden my bike three times in the past six weeks oh wow so what's the main

00:42:23.09 issue with some of your bikes okay so I have three bikes right I have my bike I

00:42:28.13 have emily's bike and I have millie's bike

00:42:31.22 uh they're all the same bike uh mine's just a little bigger right uh and so

00:42:37.09 but they're all the same e-bike so I I was riding mine on a trip and

00:42:42.13 I was riding my bike uh the other day and well actually I couldn't here's the

00:42:48.01 deal I was riding my bike about six weeks ago seven weeks ago

00:42:52.03 and uh I popped a tire and a spoke and I didn't have a spoke and so I couldn't

00:42:56.17 fix it so I called to get it repaired right and then the guy was going to it's

00:42:59.19 going to take the guy about a week to come out and repair it and uh which is

00:43:02.21 fine because I have two backup bikes I have millies and emily's and they never

00:43:06.06 ride theirs right was the spoken non-standard size uh everything about an

00:43:10.00 e-bike is non-standard so and complicated so uh I uh I'm like

00:43:14.18 no problem I can wait I have other bikes right so I just hop on emily's bike I

00:43:18.03 start riding her bike the second time I ride emily's bike I'm about seven miles

00:43:23.09 from home and it just turns off and an e-bike is an amazing piece of

00:43:29.14 machinery when it's on when it's off it's an undrivable behemoth

00:43:36.00 that weighs it goes from being uh I don't know 12 ounces to 400 pounds

00:43:43.14 so wait you can't when they and when the little motor dies it isn't it doesn't

00:43:48.14 just become a bike yeah it becomes a very inefficient bike like you can pedal

00:43:53.22 it you can work it it's got gears it's just heavy as sin and it's and it

00:43:59.16 doesn't work well it's a nightmare I feel like

00:44:01.22 you downplay the effectiveness of the bike when it's working no I don't when

00:44:06.13 the bike doesn't work it's like oh my god everything is broken all of this

00:44:11.03 stuff to us listen when the the the effectiveness is

00:44:14.03 great when it's working I don't think I'm downplaying it it's just that when

00:44:17.22 it's off you're it's first off you've got like a [ __ ] 25 pound battery the

00:44:21.13 frame is heavy it's three times as heavy as a normal bike so it's just more work

00:44:25.06 than a normal bike would be when it's not on I get that I have a normal bike

00:44:28.08 I'm actually going to get it out of storage and start riding it again

00:44:31.02 because I'm getting sick of these e-bikes but I am still

00:44:33.21 going further down the e-bike road I'm not giving up on e-bikes because I love

00:44:38.06 them uh anyway so uh seven miles away from home it it goes dead so I have to

00:44:43.13 ride it slash walk at home it's for some reason and I swear I'm not

00:44:48.12 kidding it is any direction I ride from my house

00:44:51.02 coming back is uphill it's like I live on the tallest I live in the tallest

00:44:55.12 point of Austin so I ride this [ __ ] this hunk of [ __ ]

00:44:59.15 Seven miles home take it apart the battery just won't

00:45:03.08 turn on anymore I look there's scorch marks where the battery part connects

00:45:06.12 I'm like oh it must have blown the battery out or something that sucks

00:45:11.01 batteries by the way 500 bucks to replace so I'm like that [ __ ] sucks

00:45:16.02 uh no worries I'll just ride milly's bike thank god I have a third bike right

00:45:22.00 the next day I ride milly's bike and six miles away from home

00:45:26.06 it dies in the exact same way the battery exploded again I wat it just

00:45:31.14 stopped working I walk push it home take it apart look same problem that's

00:45:36.05 scorching I call I call the company they're like yeah these batteries only

00:45:39.14 are only rated for two years so we can't

00:45:41.17 replace them it's I've had the bikes for a little over two years of course so uh

00:45:46.22 so I'm like [ __ ] well that's okay because like tomorrow the guy's coming

00:45:51.15 to fix my bike and then I uh well I wasn't tomorrow it was

00:45:56.04 actually it was actually I had uh I'm getting it wrong sorry this is this is a

00:45:59.11 while ago this is like six weeks of nonsense uh I think what had happened is

00:46:04.04 I had bought another battery in advance and so then other battery

00:46:07.17 came and I was able to put it back into emily's bike and the new battery uh it

00:46:13.02 just uh I was riding about I was about seven miles from home on the

00:46:18.13 first ride on emily's bike again after I put the new battery in and it died

00:46:24.07 and so I had to walk push it home again and six miles is no joke on foot that's

00:46:29.20 like a two-hour walk it was about two two to three hours uh

00:46:33.00 depending on yeah and it's all uphill too uh and it's also it's also October

00:46:37.12 or and November because this is about six weeks it's October and November into

00:46:43.01 Austin so it ranges anywhere from 90 to

00:46:45.02 105 right it's hot as [ __ ] still uh I am

00:46:48.12 I'm apoplectic at this point a miserable so it's my fourth time third or fourth

00:46:52.12 time the bike has I think it's the third time it's it's broken on me I get home

00:46:57.11 I look at it it's not busted I turn it on it just turns back on it's fine it

00:47:00.13 just needed to be like re-shocked awake and I'm like well that's [ __ ] weird

00:47:03.22 hopefully that never happens again and I think I'll big brain this I'll take the

00:47:07.03 battery off emily's I'll put it on millies different setup and then we'll

00:47:10.19 see if it happens again the next day I ride my bike this time

00:47:15.12 I'm about nine miles from home and it turns off oh no yeah and by the way

00:47:20.19 every single time this has happened I need to be somewhere I have a fake I

00:47:26.05 have a I have an annual pass to record or I have to pick Millie up from school

00:47:32.08 or she has a doctor's appointment I it's

00:47:35.03 never a leisurely thing I I I gotta like hoof it to get home so but I'm thinking

00:47:38.23 like I'm trying to you try to rationalize in your head by

00:47:41.14 saying like I'm getting double exercise today right like I'm getting in shape

00:47:44.15 sure then I'm done I'm like I can't I [ __ ]

00:47:47.07 I'm not gonna ride any of these piece of [ __ ] bikes anymore I've been stranded

00:47:50.12 four times the guy comes to fix my bike he fixes it he does a bunch of work on

00:47:55.04 it uh I asked him about these electrical problems in the process waiting for him

00:47:59.04 to come I bought a whole new electrical system for my bike and a new battery

00:48:03.10 for millie's other bike right and I bought a whole new electrical system for

00:48:06.19 my bike because of the scorching and stuff and I thought like I'll just have

00:48:08.21 the guy comes he fixes my bike the other stuff he won't touch any of the

00:48:11.20 electrical stuff he won't touch any of the e-bike stuff can't find anybody

00:48:15.20 who'll touch any of the e-bike stuff right and I'm like okay whatever so uh

00:48:21.03 I get it all I just don't put that stuff in I just

00:48:23.12 get the bike fixed my bike works fine the battery never died or anything on my

00:48:26.19 bike I was just trying to be preventative right I was trying to get

00:48:30.00 ahead of a potential problem hop on my bike rides like a charm

00:48:34.00 I drive seven miles and it doesn't it doesn't explode and I

00:48:38.04 go oh my bike didn't turn off at seven miles last time I did it at nine I go

00:48:44.02 nine miles I'm fine I go ten miles I'm fine and I go okay problem solved I

00:48:50.23 get about 15 miles away from home for half a marathon I know exactly how

00:48:55.20 far away from home I am because I have a uh because I have an app that you know

00:49:00.12 records all my rides how I made the fart that time and I'm right at about 15

00:49:04.11 miles from home and I'm on the hike and bike trail and I'm zooming and uh I have

00:49:09.07 my headphones on so I don't hear anything but something like jars the

00:49:12.17 bike a little bit and I look and I feel something brush my leg and I look over

00:49:16.08 to see what brush my leg like a stick or something and I see this 20 pound

00:49:20.10 battery on my bike shooting about 12 feet out in

00:49:25.07 front of me it hits my leg and just keeps flying like I gotta

00:49:29.09 it goes faster than the bike like I got a pedal to catch up with it and then and

00:49:34.12 I'm like I'm just in disbelief and I look down and there's just a hole where

00:49:40.17 the battery was before it exploded and violently

00:49:45.01 ejected itself from my bike clipping my leg and it's just like

00:49:48.13 it just like hits the ground in a pile I swerve off I [ __ ] I put the bike down

00:49:54.08 I walk over and I look I pick up the battery and

00:49:57.06 it's just like it's just like the bike exploded I don't know how else to

00:50:00.19 describe it it's like I go back to try to put it

00:50:03.22 back together everything has sheared all the bolts are broken in half

00:50:08.11 the plastic casing is broken in half the part that it connects to where the the

00:50:13.12 scorching was on the other bikes that part is melted to the battery like the

00:50:19.18 scorching part has physically melted like hot melted to the battery

00:50:24.19 what the [ __ ]

00:50:26.12 and so I'm 15 miles from home and I think I believe this story well

00:50:32.08 I guess I better get to walking and so I figure out that bike without

00:50:37.07 the battery is actually kind of light like it's a little easier to ride and so

00:50:41.06 I'm like I can make this work but I the problem is I don't know if this battery

00:50:44.22 is is savable or not because the stuff is melted to it but I feel like I can

00:50:48.01 rip it off and see if maybe the battery itself is good or maybe I can get it

00:50:51.18 refurbed because I know that these batteries can be refurbed uh and it's

00:50:55.12 like 550 to replace it so I'm like I gotta take this battery home with me

00:51:00.02 how the [ __ ] do I do this so I have to hold the battery in my left hand it's

00:51:03.23 like 20 pounds hold the the steering with my right hand and pedal home

00:51:08.13 you know at one mile an hour because this bike barely goes and I get about

00:51:12.15 three miles and I'm like I gotta throw this [ __ ] battery in the river or

00:51:15.19 like not the river but I gotta throw this [ __ ] battery in the woods or

00:51:19.07 something hide it and try to come back for it and I'm like nah I can't do that

00:51:23.01 it's too like I just gotta take this I just [ __ ] eat my medicine just

00:51:26.12 take my medicine and just get home and I'm about seven miles into the trip of

00:51:31.07 uh I've given up on riding I'm exhausted

00:51:33.12 at this point because holding a 20 pound heavy ass battery that's you know 18

00:51:38.11 inches long and hard to it's like there's no way to like I can't set it on

00:51:42.04 anything I don't have a backpack there's

00:51:44.15 no the only thing I can do is hold it in my hand and try and steer and pedal

00:51:48.04 uphill and I'm I'm like at muscle failure pretty much so I get off the

00:51:52.17 bike and I at about seven miles and I start walking it and I'm about

00:51:56.01 two miles into the walk and I have my headphones on I'm just listening to like

00:51:59.20 I don't think I'm listening like uh polo g or some really really loud rap

00:52:04.00 and uh and I just sent something out of the corner of my eye I'm on like Lamar

00:52:08.07 boulevard on a sidewalk and I look over and I see a dude in a truck like

00:52:11.12 screaming at me I'm like what the [ __ ]

00:52:13.08 is that and then I realized it's my friend joey who has nothing to do with

00:52:16.18 rt is one of his friend for my girlfriend the guy from the boat the

00:52:21.18 boat the boat it's the guy the [ __ ] boat guy the the go go now

00:52:26.10 my friend joey yeah bow guy broke I joke and uh

00:52:28.14 and he was just driving down the road and he saw me walk in a bike and he's

00:52:31.19 like hey man you need a [ __ ] ride and I was like oh my god and he gave me a

00:52:35.22 ride home so I only had to walk like nine of the 15 miles [Laughter]

00:52:41.07 but so in five out of I think like the la I think out

00:52:45.01 of like seven bike excursions five of them ended with me walking a minimum of

00:52:50.23 six miles home uh anyway I get the bike home

00:52:54.10 I [ __ ] am angry I won't look at it for like four days then I finally I look

00:52:59.23 at it I see everything that's broken and I start calling around and nobody wants

00:53:04.00 to touch this [ __ ] bike and I'm like god damn it and I I don't know if you I

00:53:07.07 don't know if you guys know this about me but I don't like working on stuff I

00:53:12.06 like I grew up in Alabama in a very like mechanically minded family where you

00:53:16.04 know I'd go I'd drive home I might I'd be like I think something's wrong with

00:53:19.07 my car grandpa and he'd be like go get the toolbox and then my entire weekend

00:53:22.09 would be me and my grandpa fixing something on the car and which was a

00:53:25.09 bonding experience for him I hated it I love my grandpa I just I'm not I just I

00:53:28.23 don't like I was a I was a tool repairman in high school I hated that

00:53:32.21 although I I liked the job I just hated I just don't like yeah I just don't like

00:53:36.18 fixing [ __ ] I'm not it's just frustrates

00:53:38.20 me you know and so I try to avoid it if

00:53:41.03 at all possible and I couldn't so I [ __ ]

00:53:43.00 it and I have all the parts so I sit down to fix my bike it took me

00:53:47.03 12 minutes to fix this piece of [ __ ]

00:53:49.14 bike and now it works great so what happened though why did it explode

00:53:54.15 yeah I don't know is it like a like a lithium vent on it or something I

00:53:59.05 don't know I don't know if it like if I just hit up

00:54:02.13 I don't think I could have hit a bump or anything hard enough to to

00:54:06.02 shear them like the screws in half and to break the casing but I was going

00:54:10.11 downhill on a smooth ride so I don't know if the bike like if the battery had

00:54:14.03 like a because it's all melted and stuff like I assumed that there was some sort

00:54:17.14 of event where it it exploded and the force of that shot it off my bike but it

00:54:21.14 didn't do any structural damage to the bike and since I'd re-bought all the

00:54:24.19 electrical stuff I had to splice some wires I had to re I said 12 minutes it

00:54:28.14 probably took me more than that um it may have taken god I just would love to

00:54:32.15 see like can you imagine being a guy just jogging the other way and then a

00:54:37.01 bicycle shoots a missile at you yeah it was like that it was like a

00:54:40.16 20-pound missile shooting at you yeah it's [ __ ] it was brutal

00:54:44.11 so when did when did this happen how long has it been since you've had a bike

00:54:48.21 issue it just I have ridden my bike twice since then

00:54:53.05 okay uh both times this week so it was last week or the week before that this

00:54:56.21 happened you're not selling me on these e-bikes I'll be able to see two weeks

00:55:00.15 two weeks ago this happened well I'm not trying to sell you on this e-bike

00:55:04.05 you were before I am gonna try to sell you on a different e-bike that I am

00:55:07.12 currently shopping around for I'm I've been going to e-bike stores and talking

00:55:11.16 to people and doing my research and I've got some some clues I got some good

00:55:15.09 leads on some good new bikes but uh yeah it was a it was unbelievable now the

00:55:19.14 bike works [ __ ] great of course but uh I it might be the most frustrated I've

00:55:24.18 been I can't even tell you like every time I get on my bike and I go like

00:55:27.16 today's the day I don't get stranded and then

00:55:30.02 just at the most inopportune moment when I'm just happy and you know head in the

00:55:33.22 clouds enjoying a ride beautiful weather listening to music whatever I was just

00:55:38.06 like suddenly suddenly it's like and you're like oh [ __ ] here we go again

00:55:42.17 you say the bike is working great I assume if you were asked before it

00:55:46.12 exploded if it was working great you would have said yes how do you know that

00:55:50.11 the bike is in fact working great and you're not just like moments away from

00:55:55.09 well everything's great until it explodes exactly yeah no totally I have

00:55:59.05 no idea you're right I'm saying it work it's working great as of this moment but

00:56:04.00 it might not be working great in an hour

00:56:06.10 I don't know that's why I'm buying a new bike that's why I'm getting another

00:56:09.11 better bike I'm getting I'm paying more money to get a better bike uh that last

00:56:12.13 longer the bikes I was looking at yesterday the guy told me

00:56:15.20 they should last 10 to 11 years before I have any of these kinds of problems I

00:56:20.13 explained every problem I had it's like we yeah we uh I think that there's a

00:56:24.06 bike out there for me I just uh sure I was just at my wits end with this

00:56:27.06 [ __ ] I can't I can't believe I had three bikes all break at the same

00:56:32.08 time and strand me as far as 15 miles away from home five out of seven times

00:56:36.14 I'm amazed that you're willing to still ride the bike because I don't I think if

00:56:40.12 I am sitting in a vehicle that explodes I'm not getting back in that vehicle

00:56:46.12 even if I think I may have fixed it that is how I trust myself that is how dire

00:56:51.13 the need for bike riding is what if you became a one-wheel guy oh

00:56:55.20 and I feel like there's something physically about like moving and the

00:57:00.14 pedaling even though can you can you ride your one wheel from home to

00:57:05.13 the office I've not done that but it has the range

00:57:09.05 I mean I would be interested in the one wheel as uh an addition to a really good

00:57:14.17 e-bike and a really good normal bike I have one I just need to

00:57:19.01 pull it out of storage for when this kind of stuff happens again because I

00:57:22.22 I've realized I don't want to stop riding like I still need to ride my bike

00:57:27.07 it's like it's how I maintain my sanity and so it's gotta happen I gotta have a

00:57:31.07 so I need to have a backup uh I thought I had three I thought I had a bunch of

00:57:35.12 backups but turns out it didn't so

00:57:37.18 ira because I was gonna say I feel like the last time we talked about you and

00:57:42.12 your bike issues the story ended with you saying that you had ordered a bunch

00:57:47.16 of spare parts for that was the spare parts yeah yeah just for extra [ __ ] yeah

00:57:51.15 it was your tail is like goldilocks if she just [ __ ] up every option every

00:57:57.01 time like it was just all three constantly broken

00:57:59.21 none of them were right they were all broken in various ways do you have a

00:58:04.04 bike entry no no I don't of any variety ebike standard

00:58:08.15 circle if you if you want to go somewhere that's

00:58:12.02 it's walkable but you need to get there quick what do you what do you go for

00:58:17.20 I leave early oh that's pretty good

00:58:24.10 there's never a situation in which I immediately need to be

00:58:28.08 at a place where I couldn't just like if I need a cab I could call a cab or an

00:58:33.12 uber or whatever it was similar yeah you just drive guys

00:58:38.10 we talked about everything on my list did we that's exciting I'm glad not

00:58:43.20 everything less not everything uh there were three other things I've invented a

00:58:48.22 new blow dryer that I wanted to show you

00:58:51.14 guys but I need to make a prototype wait

00:58:54.12 what no you can't be like I finished the list and then be like I invented a new

00:58:58.06 yeah yeah I just I saw the part I missed yeah I I invented a new product I have

00:59:00.08 to make a prototype for it I'm very excited about it it's for blowing it's

00:59:03.18 for blow drying your hair on the go I think you guys are gonna love it I think

00:59:07.20 it's gonna be a big seller for us okay uh also uh

00:59:11.16 one other thing and this is this is a bit of a bummer uh two weeks ago Andrew

00:59:17.11 our rookies played each other they did in the nfl the uh they did the the teams

00:59:23.16 played uh it was naji Harris versus uh your guy Justin fields yeah and uh um

00:59:28.15 uh my team won of course uh and it was it was a little touch and go for

00:59:34.00 a while I was watching it in bed and I decided at that moment I had been

00:59:38.21 trying I talked about this earlier I've been trying to let naji

00:59:41.21 work through his rookie season on his own without any help from me but I was a

00:59:46.02 little nervous going head-to-head against you so uh for the first time in

00:59:50.20 in our magic competition I did some incantations and some good luck spells

00:59:56.11 did two different good luck spells uh multiple times and uh you know they won

01:00:03.14 so I think that right I think the first time I I felt the need to to inject

01:00:08.21 magic into the competition it worked so I just I got to let you know

01:00:14.04 I'm using magic I hate that Gavin is currently winning this bet

01:00:19.01 that is the worst part of this and I also hate that we didn't I feel like if

01:00:23.13 we all would have known that his name was actually Michael Jones and the

01:00:26.18 mccorkle thing I feel like that would have been the guy like that's just it's

01:00:32.08 so like it's like yeah it's iconic also no magic

01:00:34.22 yeah no mad like that's it's just it's upsetting on several levels I'm still I

01:00:38.19 believe in Justin fields you should believe in Harris Geoff he looks

01:00:43.20 he looks great it's just it's going to be tough

01:00:47.11 it turns out the real magic is in the mccorkle it is did you

01:00:52.10 see that like there was one they played the announcers made like a big deal of

01:00:57.20 the fact talking about I guess naji Harris grew up homeless and they told

01:01:01.16 this story about how like yeah when he went to college he slept on the floor

01:01:04.17 for a few weeks because he just he didn't he didn't feel comfortable with

01:01:08.00 it and then after the game he was like I didn't [ __ ] where did you get that

01:01:11.16 from they never happened he's like I slept in my bed why would I not sleep in

01:01:17.12 my bed what are you saying I did not know the floor in college but I'm upset

01:01:22.15 I'm upset that uh I don't feel like um fields better start

01:01:26.03 doing some magic man I have been pushing magic really hard I've been I've been

01:01:30.14 doing my I feel like the fact that Justin fields became starter when he did

01:01:35.02 I I would like to take some credit for that I feel like I deserve a little bit

01:01:39.12 I think that's where putting potions and magic and all that towards what kind of

01:01:44.02 what kind of magic have you cost it's you know it feels weird for me

01:01:47.22 saying I deserve credit for it but for putting the ball in motion for putting

01:01:52.15 those who are capable at casting such things in the direction of him playing

01:01:56.22 I feel like some credit is deserved I feel like this show let's not say me

01:02:01.09 this show the people of Chicago okay well for most of the 80

01:02:07.09 of the show deserves some level of credit for Justin

01:02:11.01 field starting when he did Andy Dalton being on being on the bench all I'm

01:02:16.21 saying is I uh I hire hiring people elicit enlisting help on the magic front

01:02:22.20 I think is super valid and useful but if you haven't already throw a person

01:02:28.05 throw some uh throw some magic his way via yourself you know pick up that wand

01:02:33.06 do some spells it uh it worked out well that's right okay I think I might get

01:02:37.04 into that it's worth a shot I'm gonna look into that Andrew yes

01:02:41.10 have you noticed that your redemption year is coming to an end what do you mean

01:02:47.03 oh no well hmm this is a weird no no it's not no it's not it because it

01:02:54.02 was the end of the first year of the podcast so the redemption year year two

01:02:59.07 doesn't end in 2021 it ends in one June I think the first week could be oh see

01:03:04.13 you all so we're halfway through redemption we're just started redeeming Gavin

01:03:10.06 wasn't it on your birthday that we started redeeming no

01:03:14.04 it was uh it was the start of the podcast it was year two when we did the

01:03:17.23 year the show has been going on for a calendar year year two redemption year

01:03:23.12 yeah nick asks uh a great question what's left to redeem uh

01:03:28.03 still obviously the marathons the thing that needs to happen at some point and I

01:03:33.14 think that's uh I feel like I've gotten redemption on

01:03:37.07 most things at that point I think that kind of covers it yeah

01:03:40.13 yeah I think pretty good about a lot of the things that

01:03:44.09 I mean I feel like I don't know if you guys have any what do you think needs

01:03:48.00 redeemed at this stage I'd say that was that's about it so it's kind of the only

01:03:52.05 loose thread at this point I redid the salad I think the salad cream 2.0 turned

01:03:57.11 out great I redeemed the chocolate I redeemed the uh

01:04:01.20 the uh soda tried that again I can't think of a single thing you're

01:04:06.21 missing here I think I got I think I covered everything hey I noticed that

01:04:12.12 nick is the one that told us to stop talking does that mean eric's gone

01:04:17.11 Eric seems to have left alone I assume that Eric's internet dropped once again

01:04:22.09 he is

01:04:26.12 that's that's beautiful that's beautiful because earlier today I

01:04:31.20 left a meeting early the one where they were pranking me uh I left a meeting

01:04:36.13 early because I sat down to get ready for this podcast with about 30 minutes

01:04:40.15 to go and had an audio like conflict and I told him in that meeting I was like

01:04:43.15 I'm going to leave this meeting early to fix my setup and he was like oh my god

01:04:47.08 you and your [ __ ] set up again and I'm like I know I'm just going to get I

01:04:50.13 don't it won't be a problem in the episode I'll get it fixed and I did but

01:04:55.20 where's our fearless producer having tech problems again hey should we call him

01:05:01.09 no then we'd have to talk to him tisctisk as nick said

01:05:06.04 we could go on forever there's nobody at the stop we could just well we don't

01:05:10.03 want that next guy nick's got a family he doesn't that's true you know what

01:05:13.16 you're right I do have I do have one question though

01:05:17.22 I feel like a couple weeks ago a couple episodes ago who knows what it was uh we

01:05:22.03 dropped a pretty big thing in in the face being officially represented by a

01:05:27.07 superhero what was that guys naming in the the

01:05:30.01 something sportsman Marty Baxter yeah but his the chara so that's I just want

01:05:34.04 to point out the fact it's not we haven't actually we don't want to sign a

01:05:38.03 superhero we want to sign a guy that has arthritis who is possessed by an alien

01:05:43.12 technically not a superhero who we're getting at this stage

01:05:46.09 and what is his superhero name again uh the smashing sportsman smashing sports

01:05:51.02 here that's right yes so uh I just where where are we on that I uh we talked

01:05:55.01 about it and then I forgot that's I would love an update on it I don't

01:05:58.20 know how to push that ball forward internally that is something that uh I

01:06:03.09 I don't know you'd have to sounds like sounds like it's on Eric it sounds like

01:06:07.09 an error she was here if only he was here

01:06:10.11 well if you if you uh if you're related to the like a distant relative of the

01:06:14.07 smashing sportsman or you never know his family in some way Marty Baxter or or

01:06:19.18 maybe if you're like the president of do comics or Warner brothers and you wanna

01:06:23.12 uh hit us up and allow us to to use uh that character as our official superhero

01:06:28.02 we uh we promise uh we promise to do good now we should probably throw it to

01:06:33.18 uh minor league fan jack patilla to tell us what's coming up on next week's face

01:06:40.00 on next week what do you mean your idea was that he'd look at the images for

01:06:44.11 what what are you talking about like we would record next week and we would let

01:06:49.12 him read the chat and then he would record

01:06:53.07 based on that and we stick it on this one I'm sorry we're just going to edit

01:06:57.01 this in no he's right he's right like imagine what we did today but next week

01:07:02.04 we came up with the idea in this one so we can't do this one okay

01:07:06.17 as long as we're always one ahead but yeah we don't even know it's what's

01:07:10.06 weird about it we don't know what's coming next week that's why I feel

01:07:14.18 comfortable about this [Laughter]

01:07:17.11 you're right next week they could shoot it and see

01:07:20.06 how accurate it was you're right I think that's a fantastic idea

01:07:25.03 we'll try it out we'll experiment with it

01:07:29.05 hey guys minor league fan jack here to give you a preview of next week's

01:07:33.21 episode of face Geoff gives an update on his pitching the gang gives their

01:07:38.07 thoughts on karate movies Geoff goes on about his favorite apple related film

01:07:42.15 Andrew loses his mind about dark chocolate candy Geoff returns from the

01:07:47.12 proctologist and makes a shocking discovery and once again Andrew does not

01:07:53.05 eat the pencil all this and more on the next episode of face

01:07:58.09 I gotta drink so much gross water good luck with your colon 46 ounces in

01:08:03.07 the next like hour not a lot how much is an ounce it's not just water

01:08:09.05 and now it's about an ounce how much is an ounce it's the amount in an ounce

01:08:14.08 oh like a diet coke like a coke cans like six 12 ounces right 16 ounces

01:08:19.04 something like that okay so like a coke so you need to drink

01:08:23.12 what like three cans of coke essentially uh I think it's probably closer to four

01:08:29.01 but it's not just water it's like a solution that's gross

01:08:32.06 I remember when I got x-rayed I was told it would taste like a milkshake and

01:08:35.23 that's one of the most like the worst lies anyone's ever told me I've never

01:08:40.08 felt more betrayed especially as a child who had never had a milkshake before I

01:08:44.12 was like I'm gonna get to [ __ ] try a milkshake today I'm gonna get some lab

01:08:48.02 work done I'm so excited I remember the person saying when I got there being

01:08:51.19 like yeah you're gonna have to drink the solution and as a kid I remember

01:08:55.04 replying yeah I heard it tastes like a milkshake can't wait and just seeing the

01:08:59.15 the confusion on their face like that oh somebody has clearly lied to you and

01:09:04.08 registering like that was a weird facial response to

01:09:07.16 my deck one of the worst drinks I've ever had it was a traumatic experience

01:09:11.19 maybe that's why I've never had a milkshake to this day maybe we're going

01:09:16.15 deep into the core never had a milkshake but

01:09:19.07 maybe drop that on us when we're ending the episode like we've talked about the

01:09:23.08 fact that I've never had a milkshake I'm sure like that's I'm sure it's been

01:09:27.12 mentioned in the listening things I haven't

01:09:29.13 nick doesn't remember it I don't Gavin do you remember him ever saying he's

01:09:32.14 never had no I feel like I always dwell on the eggs and meatballs but

01:09:36.11 milkshake as well I'm gonna make you dinner when I come to

01:09:40.21 stay I'm gonna I'm gonna cook you a three-course meal I'll give it to you in

01:09:44.03 the bar okay you cook the meal I will design the toilet table to make it look

01:09:49.20 really nice it'll be having eggs meatballs and milkshakes and pickles right

01:09:54.23 I got pickles I've never like I've tried pickles I've never this is not a big

01:09:59.22 yeah not a big pickle guy maple syrup bananas suck I tried them

01:10:04.23 again I went in with an open mind have you ever had a banana split no

01:10:10.11 god damn man is that like is that would that elevate the banana because I'm

01:10:13.21 putting in other things so I could see it because I don't have an issue with

01:10:17.12 the taste it's the purely the texture I mean

01:10:21.01 it's pretty [ __ ] fantastic but you've not had a milkshake so you won't have

01:10:24.00 anything to I don't know we need kevin's right we need we need to spend

01:10:27.15 some time with you because all the time I've spent with you

01:10:31.01 so far I've apparently forgotten about so I need some memorable time with you

01:10:36.00 that's uh I don't know how to v that feels like an

01:10:38.16 insult that feels like we went through that I'm just gonna feel like a dig on

01:10:42.07 the way out yeah I'm gonna cook you I'm gonna cook you dinner

01:10:45.13 I thought you're about to say I'm gonna cook you a milkshake which would be an

01:10:50.00 alarming I truly don't know how they work this is

01:10:53.16 a I'm gonna say this right now Andrew this is an honor that you should and you

01:10:58.17 should feel as such Gavin lived with me off and on uh for years

01:11:02.22 over the span of like seven or eight years but he'd legit lived with me for a

01:11:08.02 couple of years like day in day out and I don't think he ever cooked

01:11:12.21 anything for me once the entire time he he certainly ate a lot of food I cooked

01:11:16.16 for him I don't think I could die on the meat once while you were grilling

01:11:21.11 so what I'm saying is savor it it's not often you get it's not often

01:11:26.06 you get world famous Gavin free to cook your meal you threw a stick at his head

01:11:31.23 when he was sun tanning in the front lawn once I feel like that also might

01:11:35.08 have certainly certainly did not and that was that was toward the tail end of

01:11:39.04 it and maybe and if I did throw a stick it might have been because the [ __ ]

01:11:44.06 never lifted a finger to help cook [Laughter]

01:11:47.14 I like you going like full oj on this I didn't do it but let me explain if I

01:11:53.02 didn't here's why I did it here's why I would have done it.

01:12:00.11 I didn't do it but I'm plenty of motive and let me explain to you why let me

01:12:05.12 tell you all the reasons that I I rightfully you should give me credit

01:12:09.11 that I didn't do this because this is all of the ammo I have for why I should

01:12:13.16 have

01:12:15.11 holy [ __ ]

01:12:17.03 good couple of eps well this one was pretty good the last

01:12:21.04 one I wasn't crazy about but uh we've done we've done it again annoyed I was I

01:12:25.18 was all I was so off oh you should have heard Geoff before you got there Gavin oh

01:12:30.15 boy he was so did you did you piss him off before he started is that what

01:12:33.23 happened I quit the podcast before we started yeah it was the bad he was not

01:12:39.14 happy it was just like the exact I just like

01:12:43.02 it was a perfect confluence of things like I uh you know

01:12:47.11 feeling like hammered [ __ ] and I mean I just I haven't eaten a meal in days so

01:12:52.15 I'm loopy I know my blood sugar's all [ __ ] up I'm thirsty or not thirsty I'm

01:12:59.02 just [ __ ] I'm like full of liquid I'm I'm literally like

01:13:03.16 shooting piss out of my butthole like a fire hose it's very uncomfortable I

01:13:08.17 spent two and a half hours on us just on the toilet this morning

01:13:12.15 before I even got up so I'm just so diminished and then I sit down I have to

01:13:16.15 have a quick 30 minute meeting about merch I realized I don't have a lot

01:13:19.16 prepared because I wasn't I was in bed until the moment I got up to have that

01:13:23.23 meeting and I sit down and I s while I'm having a meeting I'm setting up audio

01:13:29.05 for the podcast and suddenly none of it works even though all I do on this

01:13:32.19 computer is slack and this podcast I don't even go in this room unless I'm

01:13:37.12 podcasting so I don't know how it all got [ __ ] well yeah

01:13:41.03 well it's a problem I never wanted this to be my office because I knew when it

01:13:43.03 became my office I wouldn't want to come in here anymore because I would

01:13:46.13 associate it with work and unfortunately

01:13:48.15 the pandemic made that happen before the pandemic this was the my I spent all my

01:13:52.05 time here post pandemic I look at it and I see work uh anyway so I sit down and

01:13:57.05 then all that shit's broken and then immediately I'm like all right I'm gonna

01:14:00.08 have to leave this meeting early so that I can fix this so it doesn't affect the

01:14:03.20 podcast eric's immediately yelling at me about all my stuff's always broken and

01:14:07.07 I'm like got it definitely definitely needed to hear

01:14:10.23 that right now uh then uh then I'm like as I'm leaving I think oh I'm leaving

01:14:16.06 Andrew and Eric in a meeting without me they're gonna [ __ ] with me and then I

01:14:20.23 sit down I finally get it all working I sit down to start and then they start

01:14:25.00 recounting how I had already agreed to sign up hundreds of items for something

01:14:29.00 that we hadn't talked about and I was just like not doing it right now I was
