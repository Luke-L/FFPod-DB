00:00:00.03 [Music]

00:00:07.22 [Music]

00:00:15.05 I'm rolling in the pleasantries yeah me too's pleasantries parts

00:00:20.07 good day to you all how how is everyone feeling today I couldn't be better I

00:00:25.16 learned last night that macho man had a rap album in 2003 and so I listened to

00:00:29.23 all of it it's it's better than you'd expect it to be but not good obviously

00:00:35.01 but there is a child like joy to all of it how does it

00:00:37.23 compare to Stevo does Stevo have an album oh yeah yeah it's some rap I have

00:00:42.11 not heard I will okay I will listen I'll listen to Steven is it a full album or

00:00:46.15 is he just like wrapped on a few songs how does it compare to sell the stock

00:00:51.11 brokers rap album oh man john gotti [Laughter]

00:00:56.11 one of the uh the songs well first of all can you come back to an industry

00:01:02.07 you're never part of because the opening track is called I'm back and the whole

00:01:06.21 hook is that macho man's back but he never rapped before yeah and I get he's

00:01:11.00 saying like I'm back in the public eye but I don't think you could declare your

00:01:16.04 back to a thing that is your first appearance of when would you say he left

00:01:21.09 first left the public eye like when did his popularity first wane 2000

00:01:26.07 2001.

00:01:27.12 I would say 2000 because that was the folding hi welcome to the wrestling part

00:01:32.22 of the show this uh wcw folded in 2000

00:01:36.12 and when wcw got bought by wwf that contract that macho man might have

00:01:41.03 maybe had within wcw he didn't go but he did make one more

00:01:46.13 appearance in 2004 but that was it like he was done with wrestling in 2000

00:01:51.09 so he had so he was back after a three-year hiatus then that's a pretty

00:01:56.03 that's a pretty decent hiatus I think that also came in 2003 was his

00:02:01.03 spider-man cameo yeah this is the hook of the opening

00:02:04.15 track people want to know if matcha's still in the ring and my head always go

00:02:08.12 he isn't as soon as that finishes then it goes people want to know if randy's

00:02:12.13 doing his thing he's not is immediately what falls in my head then everybody's

00:02:16.21 talking wanna know this and that so I'm telling you right now randy savage is

00:02:20.10 back which always leaves me wondering is he like he's here but I don't as I said

00:02:25.01 I don't think you can come back to a thing that you've never done before but

00:02:28.12 more importantly macho man means a thing and I'll just go through it because I I

00:02:33.09 love it I love it so I think it's beautifully stupid

00:02:37.19 the m's because I push it to the maximum and the a's for the aura that they try

00:02:43.20 to become the c's for the champ six times I became and the h is for honor

00:02:49.05 I'm in the hall of fame the o's for oh yeah cause I'm so outstanding the m's

00:02:53.00 for macho I'm the last man Stan I love he has two m's and one of them means

00:02:57.15 something and the other m just means macho which is the first part of his

00:03:02.21 well I don't think he could have said the the m in macho is macho

00:03:08.06 he had to put it on the other end didn't you also just say that the c is

00:03:14.04 for six championship I guess okay yeah yes it is

00:03:17.14 six times makes the c champion but the next letter in macho is h so he could

00:03:23.07 have just had the ch b champion right but what was the h

00:03:27.15 I then lump them together no no I understand but then we would lose what

00:03:31.12 the h was for honor right because he's in the hall of fame wow I can't believe

00:03:35.18 you remember also crazy that he came up with uh that nickname before he'd won

00:03:40.21 the six championships but that's what it meant

00:03:43.12 he looked at his name later and thought that's convenient I just I just think

00:03:47.01 I'm just I don't I mean I don't want to

00:03:49.00 talk [ __ ] on macho man randy savage who uh

00:03:52.00 delighted and entertained my entire childhood but I think there might be

00:03:55.08 some retrofitting going on there I would agree with that it's interesting

00:03:59.11 it was a I didn't know it existed it's 46 minutes long

00:04:03.03 there's a love song in it a love wrap which is great there's a very heartfelt

00:04:08.21 like remembering his friend uh song to close the album

00:04:12.15 it's a weird fun listen it's very bizarre but that is just that's been my

00:04:18.16 my music for like the past 12 hours just on loop does he talk about miss

00:04:22.15 Elizabeth in it at all I don't think he does but I wondered if the love song

00:04:27.11 applied to missiles the love song was about mr perfect no yeah

00:04:31.14 no that's the in memory song there's two

00:04:34.12 different songs there's one that is like in dedication to his best friend mr

00:04:39.11 perfect he calls him I think it's called my perfect friend and there's one prior

00:04:43.21 that is just a macho man love song called what's that all about the chorus

00:04:49.16 to the song is first you love me then you hate me wanna leave me pretty lady

00:04:55.05 can you tell me what's that all about do you think

00:05:00.08 do you think he wrote all this no absolutely not I forget who uh

00:05:05.05 there's one person that was credited for most of these songs and it was not him

00:05:10.19 are there any famous guest spots does like does like 50 cent drop a bar or uh

00:05:16.01 uh I wish there are a few features on it of names I don't recognize but they're

00:05:20.14 people that have clearly wrapped for a lot longer than he has and when you're

00:05:24.10 only listening to him rap you kind of forget what what like the the level of

00:05:28.13 skill difference is between somebody that actually does this and it makes

00:05:32.12 those songs glaring how not great at it he is despite

00:05:36.04 despite his attempt you could tell he tried real hard it makes me wonder about

00:05:40.06 him right because I he's been famous and a part of uh popular culture almost my

00:05:45.12 entire life you know uh growing up in the early 80s

00:05:48.18 uh and so I I've seen him around in a million things throughout my life I've

00:05:53.09 never seen him out of character I always wonder with a guy like that

00:05:58.11 like where does randy savage begin or where does you

00:06:02.02 know what I mean and macho man end like is there like how different is

00:06:07.12 he at home on right now in his living room watching cnn or qvc

00:06:12.19 than the character he personifies I was going to say the main difference is he

00:06:17.19 doesn't hate hulk hogan but no he does he hates hulk there's a diss track aimed

00:06:22.16 at hulk hogan in the album back he's not wrestling he just hates hulk hogan and

00:06:27.08 wants him to know that I think everybody

00:06:29.08 who worked with hulk hogan seems to hate him it seems that way yeah he seems to

00:06:33.17 be terrible which is unfortunate as someone who loved him as a child he sucks

00:06:38.20 maybe he's terrible maybe it's jealousy who knows no I think he's terrible

00:06:43.07 definitely he just sucks okay I don't know the man personally but uh I

00:06:48.08 don't either but everything I know about him he sucks

00:06:51.15 strong words from Andrew panton looking to fight hulk hogan

00:06:55.07 all right the director of the tuxedo mad at me I'm willing to take on hulk hogan

00:07:00.00 why stop now sorry uh pleasantries are over guys oh they're done

00:07:04.17 it's you know what because we had it's funny you mentioned pleasantries

00:07:09.16 we recorded two episodes last week and I almost died of laughter and one over a

00:07:15.03 thing that I don't think is necessarily all that funny but it was funny in my

00:07:20.02 head it was I love that you don't even remember

00:07:22.09 that was it we were we're I was talking about the tiki mugs and it was a thing

00:07:27.04 that I genuinely think is awesome and really liked and I felt like I was just

00:07:31.07 drowning trying to talk about them genuinely and I just was like the worst

00:07:36.05 I just couldn't get out of my own head that I was just [ __ ] bombing and

00:07:41.11 tanking it just sounded terrible and you went oh

00:07:44.13 when I brought up that it was the inversion oh yeah I said oh wrong

00:07:48.23 and it broke me and it's to the point where as soon as we finish recording I

00:07:54.01 went back and I went to your audio specifically to find the

00:07:58.22 because you curve through my audio and so I went back into your audio and I

00:08:04.00 was like wow this is he's real quiet here at the start because you you've

00:08:08.15 started and you go testing test test test test and then it's just silence for

00:08:12.14 like an extended time I was curious what how much time you've spent what's the

00:08:18.02 longest you've spent doing your test and then just waiting for the clock to run

00:08:22.20 do you have a longest one is there one where you're like seven minutes

00:08:27.07 early and you're like oh boy uh probably like six minutes maybe yeah

00:08:31.11 six minutes is that the character sometimes I just get rolling and then

00:08:34.17 I'll like go and do something like I'll make a coffee or like maybe go pee

00:08:38.17 and then just at three I'll join the discord but yeah I've already been

00:08:41.18 rolling for a few minutes sometimes that's funny but that's my that was my

00:08:45.08 little secret and nick's I love that the only difference between him and us

00:08:50.00 is we're all we click on discord and then communicate with each other he's

00:08:54.00 recording just like we are he he's in the discord looking at it he just

00:08:58.07 refuses to join us until exactly until he's contractually obligated to but not

00:09:02.22 today I joined for some pleasantries how are your pleasantries gav did you enjoy

00:09:08.08 I'll be honest they sounded pretty pretty similar to this completely honest

00:09:13.16 I was unaware of where the pleasantries were different to an episode or just any

00:09:19.01 normal chair or any time we've played halo it was I I think andrew's full of

00:09:23.06 [ __ ] no I to be fair this is the pleasant nobody's ever all here for

00:09:27.08 pleasantries this is a rare time where everyone showed up 10 minutes early it's

00:09:30.19 typically nick and I will be the first ones to hop in

00:09:34.21 right so I ruined pleasantries by completing the entire cast and crew yeah

00:09:40.06 you did and it's not your fault it's just uh I'm

00:09:43.14 if anything if anyone's upset by this it's me I wish you got to experience the

00:09:47.22 real pleasantries experience but I will no longer hold it against you you tried

00:09:52.05 I tried definitely made an attempt I get I respect it I will say gav in in to

00:09:57.04 kind of bolster where you're going with that uh as someone who participates in

00:10:00.11 pleasantries pretty often uh as soon as I joined Andrew was

00:10:04.00 reading rap lyrics and he was doing a bit about macho man randy savage it felt

00:10:08.03 very content-y to me I even asked him I was like hey is this content should we

00:10:12.04 stop or is this pleasantries uh I don't know if any of that I don't

00:10:15.06 know I mean I assume that pleasantries won't make it in the end as Andrew said

00:10:18.14 pleasantries aren't for recording so they won't be in no I feel like most of

00:10:22.09 that would go in what well then why were you producing the

00:10:25.21 show 10 minutes early if you think it's content well you're the one that

00:10:29.10 initiated it you're like should we go and then everyone started recording

00:10:32.09 because you're like this this content I was just talking about a thing I didn't

00:10:36.00 expect it to be content but I think it became content because you brought it up

00:10:39.16 as content I don't know I think you presented it as content I said most of

00:10:43.07 it I didn't say all of it I think some of it is in

00:10:46.09 we'll find out I guess I won't I don't listen to it I'll never know yeah I I

00:10:51.11 guess the three of us will never [ __ ]

00:10:54.06 know it's up to nick while you were um rifling through my raw audio uh did you

00:10:57.18 find the o you were looking for I did find the o I was looking for I was um

00:11:02.08 what you remembered what was I just saying I asked as soon as we finished I

00:11:06.17 asked nick to clip it and Kelly clipped oh that's great it was great the oh

00:11:11.06 and it was the next thing you said after

00:11:13.06 that's what really killed me was I was I was really I was teetering on the edge

00:11:17.15 with your oh because I felt it sounded so disingenuous

00:11:21.03 and then you you Geoff was talking you said

00:11:24.16 uh oh no and that's that came across as equally disingenuous to me

00:11:29.12 I just wouldn't bother saying anything if it felt disingenuous like I feel like

00:11:34.05 I wouldn't just say something for the sake of it I must have just been

00:11:38.04 slightly low energy but I don't know why I would have done it deliberately

00:11:41.21 disingenuously I think I'm putting my own [ __ ] on you where it's sometimes

00:11:45.18 when you're talking to someone and you're not listening you'll make a sound

00:11:49.12 that you think goes with what they're saying so it seems like you're still

00:11:53.09 there but you're really not but you're just you're just throwing a word out

00:11:57.03 there that's what both of your reactions sounded like in my head at that time so

00:12:01.04 I'm gonna play I don't know if it'll go through we'll see on the discord audio

00:12:05.09 if it will work here we go if it will play oh oh no

00:12:13.11 I'll do it one more time [Laughter]

00:12:18.02 oh no okay in fairness if I was like uh you

00:12:22.15 know they'd be terrible takes if I was voice acting someone would probably say

00:12:28.12 do them again so in reality yeah I'm just I don't think I think that's real I

00:12:32.23 agree I completely agree do you want a redemption do you want a redemption.

00:12:40.00 [Laughter]

00:12:43.05 Hey nick can we get that to broadcast so

00:12:46.23 they can be added to the face break [ __ ]

00:12:49.11 sound board I would like both of those in there please [Laughter]

00:12:54.16 you've just deemed them unenthusiastic by the way dude that oh man you just did

00:13:00.05 ver came across as very genuine I think both both of them were genuine I would

00:13:04.17 say I think the oh in my head it was all completely in my head because I thought

00:13:08.03 I was failing I didn't even know what you were laughing at at the beginning

00:13:12.10 at the time yeah no it wasn't even all that funny it

00:13:15.11 was just I was in my own head and it just made me laugh because it seemed so

00:13:19.06 disingenuous but did you clip out your laugh can we listen to that uh how I

00:13:22.13 didn't wait one second I'm getting a phone call right now let me see if I can

00:13:27.18 uh can I swap will not it won't let me stop so I switched I made that

00:13:33.03 the noise for all the alerts on my phone so whenever whenever I get a text or an

00:13:39.22 email or a call I get the oh oh no oh and it just loops and it has been

00:13:44.19 very funny I would say Gavin that you're oh you're here

00:13:50.17 I would say that though that oh and that oh no we're exactly and I'm not I'm not

00:13:56.00 weighing in judgment either way I'm just saying they were as exactly as

00:14:00.15 legitimate as your overkill achievement all right

00:14:04.04 so it's real then it was very legitimate if you believe in the overkill

00:14:06.06 achievement then you probably believe in the oh oh no there you go I believe in

00:14:10.04 both um [Laughter]

00:14:12.17 it's j it's great I love I would reckon maybe I'll I don't know put the file out

00:14:18.00 if people want to do what I did it's amazing when things change like if I get

00:14:22.23 a twitter alert and then an email comes through it'll just go oh oh

00:14:27.14 it's fantastic I'm having a great time it spooked me like three different times

00:14:32.13 I'll be doing something then out of nowhere I'll just hear Gavin go oh oh no

00:14:38.04 I'd highly recommend speaking of halo though for a minute

00:14:42.13 I had I had a bit ruined Geoff I had something stomped on oh it was very sad

00:14:49.03 last time you know the last time we recorded we it came out that Gavin has

00:14:54.07 been [ __ ] with me with this whole screens hot game that he's oh yeah yeah

00:14:58.00 yeah I didn't know it I finally figured it out

00:15:01.11 oh we haven't done an intro Eric is saying oh yeah uh hey check it out face

00:15:05.19 episode 80 some not what is it absolutely funny here season four or something

00:15:10.21 let's go anyway you were saying so saying [Music]

00:15:14.06 that I see that Eric at three by the way

00:15:17.03 but also he's written no intro down here but at the top he wrote no intro and

00:15:22.23 then a minute later writes someone do an intro

00:15:27.16 so I learned I learned that Gavin had been [ __ ]

00:15:30.21 with me with the screens hot thing but what Gavin didn't know is that there's

00:15:36.00 an achievement in halo infinite to revive

00:15:39.16 three players in a game type that hasn't been in halo until this event that just

00:15:44.08 came out uh and it's it's it's been impossible the achievement you couldn't

00:15:47.17 get it until this event and I got a text from Gavin saying hey did you get the

00:15:51.13 achievement and I didn't because you can't it's a different game type it's

00:15:55.23 you can revive people in the game type but it's called

00:15:58.22 what is it like attrition instead of elimination because attrition at the at

00:16:03.01 the end of each round of attrition it basically ends through elimination

00:16:06.17 there's a set amount of lives and then you eliminate the final

00:16:10.04 spawns until everyone's dead so it even says elimination on the screen yes so I

00:16:14.21 assumed revive and you can revive so I assumed three revivals

00:16:20.00 in a round would be I also I assumed that when I played and I couldn't figure

00:16:24.05 out why it didn't unlock when I did it and I played several games that were

00:16:27.03 very intense trying to get this achievement and I I thought I met the

00:16:30.06 criteria to unlock it and then I read online oh it's the wrong game type it's

00:16:34.08 attrition not elimination it's a weird technicality thing so then when Gavin

00:16:38.04 texted me if you got the achievement yet I immediately replied yes and I thought

00:16:42.03 I don't know I don't know what the end result of this

00:16:45.02 will be but I could just [ __ ] with him about this and I'm hoping in my head

00:16:48.17 that he's gonna be in all these like tense games where he just needs one more

00:16:51.21 revive and he doesn't quite get it so he's annoyed by it it just made me laugh

00:16:56.11 I was I did I had so many games where I got two and I kept me like oh it's not

00:17:02.00 class so we were we're playing and it's a lie

00:17:05.11 that I never considered reaching beyond Gavin and so it was Gavin dan and uh

00:17:10.23 Bernie joined uh and he immediately asked if anyone here had the achievement

00:17:16.02 and in my head I panicked because I was like I don't I need to lie about this so

00:17:21.05 I just said yeah I got it and then I thought oh I can like message later or

00:17:26.04 something and explain because if he then doesn't get it

00:17:29.16 and then real like I then just look like a really weird liar for no reason so I

00:17:33.19 need to explain that this is a bit that I'm doing so I was like yeah I I got it

00:17:37.20 he's like wow that's impressive and we played for a little bit more and then

00:17:41.04 and then he left and we were playing and like 10 minutes after he left he

00:17:45.20 rejoined the party and it was like somebody kicked the door down he

00:17:50.03 rejoined and immediately said panton you said you got that achievement.

00:17:55.01 I was so caught off guard and I didn't know what to say so I was like yes I did

00:18:01.10 say it but no yes but no but yes but no but yes

00:18:04.17 and then he just did a game and he got three revives he had just done the

00:18:10.01 criterion it didn't pop for him so he was pissed and he was like did it [ __ ]

00:18:13.16 me over type thing and then he didn't know how to interpret my response so

00:18:18.15 then it just came out that I had been lying to Gavin about this for at least a

00:18:23.16 week you should have just [ __ ] texted him immediately and said dude ixnay on

00:18:27.06 the achievement a I I I would have but I

00:18:30.02 was so panicked the way he came into the

00:18:33.05 party jet it was like he kicked the door

00:18:36.12 I know I know that Bernie I know exactly I was not prepared

00:18:39.16 for that to play out the good news is is that there's one other lie that I've

00:18:43.13 told Gavin about halo that he thinks is true and he doesn't know what it is for

00:18:48.02 a king Geoff to me he's bloody driver's license to be here

00:18:50.23 and I can't figure it I'm trying to now remember all the things he's told me

00:18:55.03 about halo is it a good one Andrew like is it uh I

00:18:58.05 remember telling him that it was I remember telling him that him replying

00:19:02.23 that's interesting so I think I think it is it was over text and I said that's

00:19:08.09 interesting I'm not going to give you any clues as soon as it was sing

00:19:13.11 search or oh we say interesting to each other a lot [Laughter]

00:19:22.13 it was funny though when you had to come clean in front of birdie because

00:19:27.08 he was like wait what and I was like wait what and and you just were flocked

00:19:33.03 and dan was like I don't know what's going on

00:19:36.19 it was very it was a strangely heated intense moment that came out of left

00:19:42.01 field but I was disappointed that that bit has died but

00:19:46.11 I still got one in the fire it's got one nailer thing that you just don't know

00:19:49.22 what it is if you ever guess it I'll let you know but I'm not going to tell you

00:19:53.18 you said interesting too I went bowling the day before

00:19:57.08 that was that was when I was doing my investigation on your

00:20:01.08 thing I asked what you did on the on that day and you're like I can't say on

00:20:04.18 that day but I went bowling the day before so that was a joke interesting

00:20:10.00 like that actually meant something I sent you my uh overkill achievement I

00:20:13.22 said it might be the worst quality video on YouTube I must have been 20 when I

00:20:17.23 made this you said interesting I said what do you think you said I'm holding

00:20:21.06 my opinion till Thursday I said interesting that was too interesting is

00:20:26.10 across four messages I'm never gonna find this

00:20:29.03 if we did a coin flip where we one of us had to remove the word interesting I

00:20:32.10 just don't think we'd have text conversations anymore by the same maybe

00:20:36.08 we just need to be more honest about what is and isn't interesting

00:20:39.18 or increase the bar of what is because I I feel as though that was a joke

00:20:44.03 interesting but I don't I don't feel like I've ever lied about it interesting

00:20:48.21 and interesting isn't a lie word for me uh what about incredible uh incredible

00:20:53.12 might be a lie a great lie where Gavin called me out on this great question is

00:20:58.04 a great lie word for me great question is like that's what I say

00:21:01.12 when I need time to like figure out it's like a slightly longer it's like I'm

00:21:05.12 gonna respond without responding give me a second to come up with a thought for

00:21:10.12 answering your question okay that's mine I know do you have one

00:21:14.15 everything I've ever said to you is a lie.

00:21:18.17 I have such a loose relationship with the truth it's yeah it's the truth is

00:21:23.18 whatever the truth is whatever is the funniest in the moment in whatever

00:21:28.20 content I'm making

00:21:31.07 yeah I could account for that embellishments yeah

00:21:34.19 yeah that's gonna really piss me off probably for the rest of uh

00:21:38.14 I'm not are you ever gonna tell me though no I I if you guess it I will let you

00:21:43.06 know but I don't think I'll ever tell you let's just let's just say this Andrew

00:21:48.08 I've been stormid if if my relationship with the truth like

00:21:53.05 it's I if I were macho man randy savage I would be sitting on my sofa right now

00:21:58.13 watching qvc going oh yeah cubic zirconium I would be full like I

00:22:03.07 there's no I can't take the hat off so [Laughter]

00:22:08.00 I just like imagining you watching qvc just generally speaking dude I [ __ ] I

00:22:13.16 like to watch the knife the dudes that sell knives at like three in the morning

00:22:17.22 do they sell what what what is their angle what is it how does this is like a

00:22:21.12 [ __ ] country dudes it's just there's like a there's two there's like a

00:22:25.00 million different qvc type things but I always see the one like when I'm in

00:22:28.00 hotels and [ __ ] where they like there's like a lucite lazy Susan type thing in

00:22:32.14 the middle and it just spins with like a different buck hunter knife on it and

00:22:35.21 then it'll be like a different kind of knife and they'll just talk about how

00:22:39.20 great the knife is I like I could watch that forever

00:22:42.04 my favorite one I like whenever they do tech stuff

00:22:45.18 I don't remember what exactly the specifics of it they tried to sell

00:22:48.23 xboxes on qvc and then like trying to explain why an Xbox one was great was

00:22:53.22 fantastic I would there should be like just a channel do they post all those

00:22:58.04 online that's like [ __ ]

00:23:00.17 like they should do that I guess it's not in their best interest but I've been

00:23:04.19 watching more of that kind of content for the last few months uh just for like

00:23:09.04 osmosis purposes you know we're gonna launch so uh

00:23:12.14 at some point when gavin's available we're gonna we're gonna film this uh

00:23:15.19 we're gonna film that show I don't know if we talked

00:23:18.09 it's called does it do but anyway we're gonna film that show uh where we like

00:23:21.13 test out infomercial products and so I've been I'm trying to you know

00:23:26.00 I'm trying to I'm trying to steep myself in that world so I have those kinds of

00:23:29.12 shows on a lot these days research yeah I immediately tried to do the same thing

00:23:33.17 we're just watching paid programming but

00:23:36.13 unfortunately almost everything I get is this one guy who I it tries to sell

00:23:42.15 it's like the bible of business advice like he uses the background like it's a

00:23:48.08 church setup but it's just like this is a book

00:23:50.17 on how to be successful in business and it sucks it's a terrible like one

00:23:55.12 hour long maybe 30 minutes I don't know but anyway terrible I don't have fun

00:23:59.18 ones I wish I had knife guys I'd love to

00:24:01.23 watch somebody try to sell me on a knife because I feel like it's an easy sell

00:24:05.21 you're not really looking for too many things out of a knife I uh yeah it's

00:24:10.13 like does it stab good uh I uh I'll send you some I'll send you

00:24:15.05 some knife content please too I'd love some good knife content absolutely

00:24:18.19 why are why aren't knives better what do you mean by that like isn't

00:24:23.03 there a metal we can make knives out of well it doesn't go blunt over time like

00:24:28.06 should a chicken really blunt my knife if I if I cut 100 chickens up I don't um

00:24:33.11 there are like Japanese knives those are really high quality but even those go

00:24:38.04 dull still gotta be sharper still have to be sharpened

00:24:42.10 Japanese knives are cool um but a knife that never dulls

00:24:46.11 yeah what's the most resilient metal what what is the most like Google

00:24:52.17 I don't know the most resilient has to feel good though as well I can't

00:24:58.10 I would rather take a knife that dulls but feels good to use than chromium

00:25:03.07 chromium chromium knife do they sell this yeah

00:25:09.03 chromium knife blades oh they you can buy a hammacker slam schlamacker for

00:25:16.03 154.95 the forever sharp french chef's knife kitchen knife dude we can get some

00:25:21.22 chromium not whoo we should I got a chromium chisel have you had to sharpen

00:25:27.17 it uh no I only used it a week ago to put in a new electric door handle

00:25:48.08 what a great throwback that was a great great call back buddy

00:25:55.05 I get to take notes on that as somebody who uh who killed it with a

00:26:00.01 call back recently of the bread clip I'm gonna take notes on on great callback

00:26:04.14 execution that was perfect but you just totally nailed you rolled with it it was

00:26:08.10 amazing I don't know why I've said it because it

00:26:11.09 doesn't make sense I feel like you I think you may have said the batteries

00:26:15.15 ex I think you may have used the word expired which then made me think of of

00:26:20.06 food expiring which then made me think of the purpose of a bread clip well that

00:26:24.17 is funny did you did I say it like 90

00:26:26.22 seconds earlier though because it seemed to come out of nowhere no I wish there

00:26:31.00 was there was something recently that on the podcast where I thought I had a

00:26:34.06 really funny line and I didn't say it and there's nothing funnier on a podcast

00:26:37.11 than talking about something funny you could have said but didn't this is great

00:26:41.19 I'm doing great content right now let me enthrall you with is that the

00:26:46.00 right word that was the right word right

00:26:49.11 yeah you nailed it I nailed it yeah that

00:26:52.08 was good it's a good moment by me I have I have moments where I uh

00:26:55.15 listening back to the podcast I can see areas where I was about to tell a joke

00:26:59.23 and I just don't but sometimes like because I you can hear me go like and I

00:27:04.01 I'm when I'm listening to it I'm like oh I know I was going to say that that um

00:27:07.14 you know that could have been funny but I didn't say it but there are some times

00:27:10.19 where I just leave the setups in and then don't and then I

00:27:14.12 that I give up on it and don't deliver the punchline

00:27:17.17 but there was a bit where Geoff was talking about his bikes and his

00:27:21.12 exploding batteries uh-huh he was talking about the spokes and I was and I said

00:27:25.22 something like oh were they custom and what I was gonna say was you could say

00:27:30.06 it was bespoke but I I just left in the is it a custom thing and I never did the

00:27:35.09 punchline because I just thought better of it

00:27:38.12 and you would never know what I was about to say has has there ever been a

00:27:42.21 one where you tried to guide the car back to the ramp on a future episode did

00:27:47.12 you ever have you ever tried to take us back because you thought a line was so

00:27:50.23 good that you needed to get you got to run this back have you done that

00:27:56.12 I haven't done that I have more like uh I'll have an idea of something

00:28:00.22 to talk about and then it just never comes up and then I question should I

00:28:04.21 still talk about it because I I think it's funny but it doesn't make sense

00:28:10.04 it's been so long since the main thing like devry so oh boy

00:28:13.23 we're going to a lot of places here so on the rt podcast at one point it was

00:28:18.15 brought up recently it'd be funny to because we have a

00:28:21.04 uh on the next episode of jack does at the end of these where he guesses what

00:28:25.06 will happen and it was joked about that what if we did a previously on at the

00:28:30.21 start of the episode and so I thought that's a funny idea

00:28:35.11 what if like I could get some weird person to do the previously on

00:28:39.01 that no one would be able to know like it would become a mystery of who is the

00:28:42.18 previously on because I loved lost and that was like a weird thing for a while

00:28:46.00 with loss where people are like who the

00:28:47.19 [ __ ] is the previously unlost voice and they kind of like kept it a mystery so

00:28:51.09 it's like hmm what would be a funny nobody would be able to guess who is

00:28:56.23 this voice and so I reached out to the guy that wrote that variety article.

00:29:02.19 [Laughter]

00:29:04.00 I was like hey did I ask you something and I didn't

00:29:07.07 know how to approach it and uh we talked very nice todd's great todd's a great

00:29:12.22 guy he politely declined in doing the previously on which is why I'm bringing

00:29:17.13 it up now but that is something all in the last two we recorded was constantly

00:29:21.01 in my head of like I want to talk about the fact that I talked to the guy that

00:29:24.04 wrote that variety article and that never got to happen did he explain

00:29:28.06 himself yeah explain himself uh no I didn't ask that I didn't ask why we

00:29:33.07 weren't included I just I brought up ah that's all

00:29:35.12 what's the point no I don't really care why I don't think [ __ ] variety

00:29:39.10 includes us or not it doesn't matter in any way to me that aspect of it I just

00:29:43.14 what was funny to me about the variety thing as I said was the fact that they

00:29:47.12 you would assume they would have to at least consider it there would be some

00:29:51.03 form that's what would be good to know like was that's what we wanted the list

00:29:54.23 was it someone in our company who didn't give it to him or was it he had it and

00:29:59.11 didn't want to include it I don't care about that information but

00:30:02.14 you do care you talked about how funny it was how you loved the idea that at

00:30:06.15 some point he had to sit down and make a

00:30:08.10 decision what to include and what not to and what would be

00:30:12.12 safe for variety or not and and you had the man who had to make

00:30:15.19 those decisions on the hook and you didn't ask him about those decisions

00:30:20.10 that was the whole point of all of this you don't make any sense no

00:30:24.23 I I straight Instagram you talk to anyone else I'm disappointed no here's

00:30:30.19 let me explain myself if I get an answer to that question it might no longer be

00:30:35.02 funny anymore if I just assume what happened it's funny if I continue to

00:30:40.08 live in the world in which my assumption is correct it's funny to me

00:30:43.16 and there's no risk of that changing I don't really care that we weren't

00:30:47.06 mentioned in the variety thing I don't

00:30:49.22 give a [ __ ] about what variety thinks of this podcast

00:30:52.13 doesn't matter to me what's funny to me is that proper like established

00:30:57.07 businesses that don't have that tone at all have to

00:31:00.10 at least look at the name theoretically and then decide if they want to include

00:31:03.21 it I don't asking I don't need confirmation for that that's just I'm

00:31:07.12 deciding that's how that goes I didn't care about that I just thought it'd be

00:31:10.13 really because nobody would [ __ ]

00:31:12.09 guess was the variety guy doing the previously on that would have been a

00:31:16.06 great game of course they wouldn't would have been

00:31:18.22 a fantastic yet so now I'm I'm trying to think of somebody kind of tied to the

00:31:22.21 show that is Jackie chad I don't think I should get Jackson

00:31:27.07 I don't think Kevin Donovan would vouch for me unfortunately at this time so I

00:31:32.19 don't that'd be a tough one dusty baker I thought about

00:31:37.16 trying to get somebody in the zimmer family but then I thought I don't know

00:31:41.11 how they'd feel about the boys the zimmer shirts and all that I don't know

00:31:44.23 necessarily if they'd love them yeah I'd hoped they would but I just don't know

00:31:49.18 yeah and a lot of us laughing at that dead relative getting shoved into the

00:31:53.20 ground head first that's I kind of forgot about that that was like

00:31:58.12 yeah maybe not the greatest idea it was interesting I was reading about I don't

00:32:02.12 know if you know about this Geoff I didn't know a lot about don zimmer's

00:32:05.21 time with the texans which is when he was on that that was when he ate the

00:32:10.02 fried chicken yeah the 1982 guys I was reading about it I don't are you

00:32:14.04 familiar with what happened to him when he was on that team no

00:32:17.11 he was fired on a he was fired on like Monday and asked to manage the team

00:32:22.05 through to Thursday but they they fired him on Monday and

00:32:25.12 they had him they had him like manage a game beyond being told that he

00:32:29.13 was gonna get fired at the end of the week something happened that nobody

00:32:33.13 knows what like five days prior to him getting fired the owner said I think

00:32:37.12 zimmer's doing a great job and then he had an all-day meeting and from what I

00:32:41.11 can tell the owners never said zimmer never said what happened but something

00:32:44.23 happened and he fired him immediately after they had some disagreement that

00:32:49.08 has never become public and so he fired him on a Monday but he had to manage on

00:32:53.14 Wednesday and they had a press conference post all this coming out and

00:32:57.07 somebody asked during is one I wish there was audio or video of this at such

00:33:00.20 a contentious press conference where it's the owner and zimmer and somebody

00:33:05.11 asked the owner can don zimmer have a job in a different

00:33:08.14 part of the texans organization and the owner said absolutely don zimmer is this

00:33:14.04 beloved man in baseball he's great fantastic he can have any job in this

00:33:19.01 building that he wants to which don zimmer then replies what I want is to

00:33:23.01 manage the team on Friday when they play against the Yankees that's what I would

00:33:26.21 like and the owner looks at him and then says

00:33:29.16 to the media don is going to be playing golf on Friday instead it's been a very

00:33:34.08 stressful time but you know I think we all think it's in his best interest that

00:33:39.05 you just relax and play some golf to which then dom doubles down and says no

00:33:44.13 I don't want to play golf I want to manage the team on Friday

00:33:48.03 against the Yankees but it appears I'll be playing golf it's great I just love

00:33:52.15 that they had this insane press conference where he's arguing with the

00:33:55.22 owner what was going on then I don't know it was a wild time they seemed like

00:33:59.22 a dumpster of a franchise at that time um but it was wow getting into some don

00:34:04.19 zimmer signing out oh Gavin just posted a screens hot interesting

00:34:09.14 all the interesting nick said we should ask Pedro Martinez I

00:34:14.09 think that's a great idea he's he is out and available he's doing mlb commentary

00:34:19.18 he's uh he's used to recording I bet he'd be he'd be

00:34:23.05 super uh willing and available to do who do you think is more likely Pedro

00:34:27.05 Martinez or coolio uh well we've been more pro Pedro Martinez than we have

00:34:32.13 been coolio I feel like we earlier signaled that we were not but we sing

00:34:37.11 that we were coming for him we're coming to that's true I forgot about that

00:34:42.13 if coolio did the previously on he could

00:34:46.06 end this previously on and just say here it goes um that's true

00:34:50.10 is that a coolio song it's just the end of the what's the beginning of Keenan

00:34:54.21 and cow in it oh here it goes oh for a thing that we've talked about like

00:34:59.13 eight times I have no concept I have no memory of any of the coolio rap lines

00:35:04.23 outside of abbott and costello were mentioned and

00:35:08.02 that might be it I think that's all I remember about the abbot the the coolio

00:35:12.14 rap I mean it was it was a kell quote wasn't it from the show nobody watched

00:35:16.05 it I don't know why I'm asking I watched it I think I've seen every

00:35:19.18 single episode of Keaton and kale multiple times I bet I bet you could get

00:35:23.15 I bet we could get kell I met him once he's really really nice and seems you

00:35:27.20 met both of them I guess I did not the same time though

00:35:30.10 years apart but I did meet kel first and he seemed lovely I was so baffled that

00:35:34.15 that was a question Gavin that I didn't register it as a question I thought you

00:35:38.14 were like talking uh when you asked about Keenan and kell like it was such

00:35:42.23 an absurd idea to me that you would ask either of us after the history of of the

00:35:47.05 rap what did I ask didn't you no we're not doing this again didn't you

00:35:52.20 just phrase a question you said isn't it a Keenan and kel thing we're talking

00:35:57.02 about Keenan and cal and you you brought up isn't it a line for the show

00:36:01.12 and then you said that's a perfect example of the moment had gone past I

00:36:04.20 shouldn't have returned to it because you were not you had left the building

00:36:09.02 well it was too far it was too far enough for me to remember what question

00:36:12.04 you were talking about and then when I said what question you didn't have well

00:36:15.22 because I don't Keenan and kell does not stick in my brain so I was struggling

00:36:20.03 let's try to like recreate the backdrop of the scenario of where it was asked

00:36:25.11 the longer we talk about it the better it gets [Laughter]

00:36:29.22 nick can you clip that moment and then we can submit that to webster's uh

00:36:35.11 or numerium for their audio dictionary to describe that there's the perfect

00:36:40.12 dictionary uh example of what that moment is what moment is exactly thanks nick.

00:36:50.00 I learned something else that kind of blew my mind I feel like most people

00:36:54.22 will probably realize this I [ __ ] up in kind of a not interesting way I

00:36:59.20 thought that David Hasselhoff was a part of blue swede that's what I thought

00:37:05.08 I hooked on a feeling banned yeah I thought hooked on a feeling was the

00:37:09.18 David Hasselhoff song and he sung well because I think he covered it

00:37:14.19 and it like crossed in my brain that he was just the singer of the blue suite

00:37:20.10 version so I just assumed he was in blue Sweden and so to learn

00:37:24.15 that he doesn't he's not and that he has an extensive cover career was was fun

00:37:29.14 but I've lived I don't know my whole life thinking that David Hasselhoff

00:37:33.08 whatever I'd hear hooked on a feeling I always assumed it was David Hasselhoff

00:37:37.12 well it's because he performed it so well he he he he owned that performance

00:37:41.17 so I don't think I've heard the Hasselhoff have you not seen the video

00:37:45.12 you must have a great video oh we're putting the video in right now I know

00:37:50.06 this is an audio podcast I pulled it we will describe what is happening that is

00:37:55.20 what I went on a whole binge of hasselhoff's music videos after this one

00:38:00.17 of the greatest videos of all time it feels very much like

00:38:03.17 Hasselhoff got a green screen and was really excited about it all right I'm

00:38:07.21 like get loaded up just immediate you're immediately hooked you're hooked on a

00:38:13.11 feeling immediately are you dealing with you got the dancing bear

00:38:17.20 you got this dog it was he like a yeti flying over the clouds what's happening

00:38:23.05 here is it like an inuit suit snowball or something right yeah

00:38:27.14 I like that it's not even like the background footage isn't even the same

00:38:33.03 aspect ratio it's like he's standing in a bunch of crushed people I know

00:38:38.12 either David Hasselhoff is a comedic genius or it's one of the greatest

00:38:42.11 accidents of all time it's the way that the video builds off of itself it's a

00:38:46.05 very popular video I'm surprised you haven't seen it I was like yeah I've

00:38:50.17 missed that it's uh what is this the him dressed up in safari dancing oh billy

00:38:55.01 yeah they must have known this was funny

00:38:57.07 I don't know they sing I can't tell them sooner

00:39:06.02 yeah they know what they're doing with this I feel like they do but it's it's

00:39:10.21 great but it's possible they don't I mean I feel like they do maybe he

00:39:16.06 doesn't that's yeah that's kind of kind of a macho man situation [Laughter]

00:39:23.07 what about you guys how have you been wait we're back to pleasantries no I

00:39:28.02 just yeah I feel like I'm talking a lot I've learned about Hasselhoff and match a

00:39:34.08 man I wanted to talk to you about how serious you are about this uh donkey Kong

00:39:40.02 challenge oh okay I'm very serious about it when does everybody brought it up

00:39:44.08 that's a great question because I walked away from that going I don't know if I

00:39:49.14 ever set a date what about when this comes you said it needed to

00:39:52.15 start on a Saturday after a recording okay or after when it comes out this

00:39:57.05 will come out on a Wednesday this Saturday I will start the thing and

00:40:01.19 that's when the 48 hours o'clock or what

00:40:05.07 happens is 40 hours what was the time we adjusted the time 44 hours I think 44

00:40:09.10 hours I have to ask a question before we get any further of course you started

00:40:13.22 this response by saying great question so am I not am I not to believe you now

00:40:18.15 no because everything that now has said post a great question is a lie that

00:40:22.01 you've come up with on the moment no it's it's a problem where it's also just

00:40:25.09 kind of my go-to response I think that was a genuine great question

00:40:28.23 I didn't need time for that one that was a genuine great question I unders I see

00:40:33.11 what you're saying it is a dilemma it's a real problem I'm gonna work it out but

00:40:38.17 that was a great question at facepod on twitch

00:40:43.07 I think what what day though saturn what day is when does this come out what day

00:40:49.16 is the number the numerical date this will be on February 16th February worked

00:40:55.07 this out last time figure out when maybe

00:40:58.00 this week's one will come out maybe this

00:41:00.04 happened it's now happening well you did this you did this to us it's your fault

00:41:04.15 if it has February 19th will be the start time 12 a.m

00:41:08.22 44 hours I don't wait that long well we've recorded a few for you this is

00:41:13.16 your fault that you have to wait that long we're ahead because of you

00:41:18.13 this is you you did this I'm glad you brought that

00:41:21.20 up though cause I I had been thinking that I I felt like I don't know what I'm

00:41:25.17 supposed to start this but it would feel weird for me to bring

00:41:28.19 it up so we're set are you get you're good with the 64 pieces of clothing I'm

00:41:32.23 gonna be honest I didn't know joey had a bit and friends were that it was that

00:41:37.06 so I thought that was exactly 64 was it exactly 64 pieces there's no way it was

00:41:41.11 exactly it was just he's wearing a lot of clothes for some reason

00:41:45.14 people have worn a lot of clothes throughout the since the beginning of time

00:41:51.14 since the beginning of time nick wrote something very funny in the chat

00:41:57.01 if you watch friends I I didn't I still thought it was funny I

00:42:01.06 haven't seen it I still think why didn't you just read the line why didn't you

00:42:04.15 say that nick said something funny why didn't you just say what he said why are

00:42:10.12 we dissecting every bit well this was weird cause that means

00:42:14.21 nothing now people don't know what nick said there's a weird way to handle that

00:42:20.02 situation nic why did nick why does nick deliver

00:42:23.12 it in in the style of said character oh I like this

00:42:28.19 nick I'm gonna need that clipped too that's gonna go for the sound board as

00:42:33.11 well nick unmuted inside yeah definitely uh could he be wearing any more clothes

00:42:39.01 that was good that was great man that was really good that was really good

00:42:42.10 nick really good I'd love to hear him do an o I bet you

00:42:45.02 that would sound just as good delivery I'm not going to do callbacks this is

00:42:49.17 what I've I've I'm done oh that was pretty good

00:42:53.12 that was I think Eric hasn't said very much on this one

00:42:56.04 why why I was here for the pleasantries and then you guys you know I'm not I'm

00:42:59.20 not featured here it's all you guys I will say that Eric came in hot with

00:43:03.12 dates like we were talking about like when macho man randy savage like

00:43:07.20 initially retreated from the public eye and

00:43:12.00 Eric was like the [ __ ] like nwa was was uh dis-incorporated on this exact

00:43:15.17 day and then he did like Eric has like a timeline of everything that's ever

00:43:19.08 happened to wrestling so he he was very beneficial uh early on to the but that's

00:43:24.12 all pleasantries so I don't know if that made it Gavin [Laughter]

00:47:26.23 well I I meant this is going to be an Eric question we were so we played halo

00:47:31.22 a little bit a little bit ago three of us no Geoff and and you and myself played

00:47:37.03 some people in a minute I haven't played halo with you guys in weeks it's been

00:47:41.04 it's been some time it's listen it took a while to put this together

00:47:46.04 but we're talking about if you let's say

00:47:49.11 that you were created you just you exist

00:47:51.12 and you had to pick a country to live in based only on its flag

00:47:55.01 you don't know anything about it you just all the only point of context you

00:47:59.02 have is the flag for the place what flag would you pick

00:48:02.19 and then talk to we led into we're making like conversation about joke

00:48:07.18 facts for different countries so I emailed every country

00:48:12.10 what fact they would want if they were gonna if they could share

00:48:15.10 one fact about their country who's answering the country's inbox I

00:48:19.18 don't know I didn't get any replies that's what I'm saying I've been

00:48:22.13 disowned by every country I emailed every country asking if you could share

00:48:27.01 one fact about some countries don't nick

00:48:29.06 that's a great point he asked does every country have an email address some

00:48:34.08 countries do not but every country that did I email

00:48:37.19 what do you mean what do you what do you mean what do you email a country like

00:48:41.09 the you like the government like you Google

00:48:44.19 the country and typically there's like an official

00:48:47.07 country tourism website that they've made for their own place you're emailing

00:48:51.09 the tourist board uh yeah I'm emailing the tourist board for the country does

00:48:57.07 that constitute you you could just email like Steve I'm not [ __ ] emailing

00:49:03.03 travelocity I'm emailing the the country represented tourist website

00:49:08.06 have you seen nick's email address united states of america at usa usa usa. Gov

00:49:13.20 a lot of places you don't know their email address you just put in like a

00:49:18.12 contact form and you wonder why you got no replies I I didn't I didn't get but I

00:49:23.06 feel like I'm being ghosted by every country at the moment and I I don't feel

00:49:26.23 like I have one I feel like I'm a man without country but we all answered that

00:49:31.01 question so I was gonna ask Eric if he was gonna pick a country based purely on

00:49:36.23 flag alone what country would he go with okay uh Albania Albania yeah

00:49:42.04 Albania I don't even know what Albania's

00:49:45.10 flag looks like oh you should look it up Albania flag yeah you could just

00:49:50.07 probably type in the word Albania I don't two-headed bird what is this it is

00:49:55.23 I don't know if I like this you don't know if you like these it's

00:49:59.22 weird that countries aren't getting back to you man that's nuts no okay let me

00:50:04.01 the Albania flag looks like somebody that you wouldn't want to play a

00:50:07.17 multiplayer game with like in a shooter like that can somebody lick the Albanian

00:50:12.11 flag [Laughter]

00:50:16.17 what a great question oh that's uh that's a you wouldn't want to live there

00:50:21.14 just here's a no dude you can see what do you

00:50:25.04 mean you can see the birds have tongues you can see their tongues however you

00:50:29.11 see a bird that flag that flag looks like war

00:50:33.04 that's a that's an aggressive flag I want to live here's my flag

00:50:38.06 Kira body there's a seagull there's [Music]

00:50:48.10 my birds have tongues two heads going nuts you're crazy

00:50:52.06 you're bad your flag is a mythical beast with a thousand

00:50:56.00 talents the person that represents your flag is telling me to uninstall the game

00:51:01.08 because I don't have a high enough kd like what I don't want to live in your

00:51:06.04 nation it stinks Geoff's flag is great he's the

00:51:10.06 if I'm in a game lobby with Geoff's flag he's playing music too loudly but it's

00:51:16.04 chill music so I'm okay with it he's not doing all that great but he's island

00:51:21.12 vibes man I'm having a great time mon I'm loving life is

00:51:24.23 curabass I think isn't it it's not the one that was like right on the dateline

00:51:28.23 and it switched size at one point and they lost

00:51:31.17 or they gained a day like something weird happened with that little place

00:51:34.21 really I don't know but I bet they were so [ __ ] chill and relaxed they didn't

00:51:38.12 notice.

00:51:40.12 I think it was to do with like doing business with Australia or something

00:51:44.10 that kept me in the weekend on the wrong

00:51:46.07 day or I don't know I can't remember hey can I tell you guys about a little side

00:51:49.20 story in the middle of this because it just happened a little saga that's gone

00:51:53.16 on in my library while uh you guys are talking about

00:51:56.14 the welsh flag by the way uh yeah but link it up dude I missed the first half

00:52:01.12 of all of that because Henry started barking I ran up to open the door for him

00:52:05.21 because I was recording the uh the other

00:52:08.17 podcast I do this morning the theme park one and you know Henry there's a strict

00:52:12.22 no uh there's a strict no squeezy toy rule in all other podcasts like Henry

00:52:18.06 it's like vin diesel saves his uh muscles for vin diesel movies I save

00:52:21.19 henry's squeaks for face right and so we we have there's a I swear to god

00:52:26.14 there's a bit of a tension between Henry and I when I'm doing other podcasts

00:52:30.02 where he just kind of is annoyed with me and so this morning while I was

00:52:33.14 recording with jack I had forgotten to open the door and uh

00:52:37.11 it started to smell and I thought Henry farted and I turned around he took a

00:52:41.00 giant mega [ __ ] right behind me this morning on the rug and I was like ah

00:52:45.20 damn it I went and I cleaned it up and I

00:52:47.16 felt bad because it was my fault because

00:52:50.02 I left the door closed uh so so we could go potty after breakfast and uh just

00:52:53.01 completely slipped my mind I'm a little loopy today I apologize I'm on some cold

00:52:56.17 meds so uh when you they start you guys start

00:52:59.06 having the Albanian conversation Henry started barking and I went oh [ __ ] he's

00:53:02.12 about to take another dump he's letting me know I ran over

00:53:06.02 and I opened the door to let him out but I forgot the alarm has been on all day

00:53:09.14 so then the alarm started going off so then I had to run around to the front

00:53:13.09 house and disable the alarm and then I came back in and I slid into the middle

00:53:16.21 of it and I went that's an interesting flag Eric okay

00:53:19.07 nobody would have ever known but it's too ridiculous not to tell you guys

00:53:23.05 anyway uh I got it fast dude oh also uh maybe you did hear it I don't know but

00:53:29.03 no anyway you didn't you didn't hear it going uh back door open alarm alarm or

00:53:34.14 whatever she was saying I heard it uh anyway Gavin your flag uh that's whales

00:53:40.03 that's whales the dragon I thought your people didn't like whales uh

00:53:46.12 I don't think I like whales I I always like I remember

00:53:50.10 we were even there visiting I was like should we go to wales I want to go to

00:53:54.03 Cardiff or whatever and you were like there's no reason to go there it's

00:53:55.16 boring nobody likes wales I remember you telling me you think that was ever on

00:53:59.12 the cards it was Scotland or France that we were going to go to no no I remember

00:54:04.00 this is the the 10 year ago vacation or 15 years ago at this point yeah no I I

00:54:07.18 was I remember it coming up because I'm part welsh and I thought I wanted to go

00:54:11.09 see the homeland and you're like no you don't it's just guarding west

00:54:15.20 uh well I don't remember that obviously well just for the record

00:54:20.10 I'm pro whales so I like your flag do you think Eric had Albania ready to

00:54:26.04 go or did he just Google list of countries in alphabetical order and

00:54:31.09 picked like one of the first ones I think he googled angriest flag yeah I

00:54:35.01 had it ready I had it ready to go I think albania's flag is cool as [ __ ]

00:54:40.08 okay I think it's cool look at it it's gavin's has one tongue yours has one

00:54:45.11 bird mine has two headed bird tongues mine is like a tail tongue that is true

00:54:50.00 is that better did maybe you just maybe that might not

00:54:53.22 even be a tongue it might have just eaten another dragon [Laughter]

00:54:58.14 or he's just got a tongue coming out of his ass think about it I am I don't I

00:55:03.16 I don't I genuinely don't like the Albania fleck I'm not a fan of it

00:55:08.12 you're crazy I don't understand like what do you want in a flag I don't want

00:55:14.08 to I don't know like I don't I feel like that flag

00:55:18.23 would be used to represent the villains in like a from software game is like the

00:55:25.09 vibe I get it's a menacing flag and where are those where are those

00:55:30.00 villains in that game and what's the time frame well the like the wolfenstein

00:55:35.07 like type games like it's this the like it feels very

00:55:38.12 military malicious what what is the word I'm looking for malicious

00:55:43.03 nonsense it's the word you're looking maleficent is the trying thing

00:55:47.16 miller is trying to say

00:55:50.08 that I got there without nick which he gave me the assist or he had

00:55:54.21 the right word but I got there yeah I also said it but all right I didn't hear

00:55:59.22 you I'm sorry I wasn't I wasn't listening all right that's okay uh [Laughter]

00:56:05.03 another callback um well you're a flag I think your flag's a

00:56:10.10 bit on the nose isn't it what do you mean who's flying Canada

00:56:14.10 I never said I'd pick my flag you're not a fan of your own flag no it's totally

00:56:20.01 fine I think I have a decent flag I wouldn't I don't think I'd pick Canada

00:56:23.21 based off of the flag alone I think the usa flag is kind of a problem

00:56:28.16 in what way well we've locked ourselves in with those 50 stars it makes it hard

00:56:33.04 to add or subtract didn't always have 50

00:56:35.07 stars in it no it went from like it didn't you're right but it's I mean if

00:56:39.06 you look at it it it's proportioned very well I've often tried to look at that

00:56:42.19 flag and try to figure out how we would stick a puerto rico star in there or

00:56:46.12 take one um or another country just ditch a state now that that's an

00:56:50.08 interesting like we we dump Arkansas but pick up Guam

00:56:54.13 I think you can only remove and not add nobody likes dlc

00:56:57.06 it'd be a real problem because I try to add on I'd be pissed if I had to buy a

00:57:01.20 whole new flag for one additional star well they could add like do as well as

00:57:06.10 you know as its own state yeah that's a good point that is a good point

00:57:11.10 should we eat this [ __ ] candy that's been on my desk for this

00:57:15.10 entire episode oh am I the only one that

00:57:17.15 did this did you not do this did you not do the prep cap what do you mean did he

00:57:22.13 not do it of course he didn't do it the only homework I wrote down was to turn

00:57:26.09 up for pleasantries what was the other thing what did I need

00:57:30.10 to buy we were gonna eat everybody's favorite candy and then we were gonna

00:57:33.10 pick the best candy and then I was thinking that could be the official

00:57:36.11 candy face for the year and and you have them too Geoff of course I have I've had

00:57:41.14 them for weeks what do I need well you need for Geoff you need star burst

00:57:47.03 you need mini star burst unwrapped flavor reds and you need big chewy nerds

00:57:54.13 for Andrew you need big chewy sour nerds and then for Gavin you need a kinder

00:58:01.12 bueno okay I got all that

00:58:06.08 um.

00:58:10.06 I like that we open this with the possibility of you this has been a bad

00:58:15.05 voice over performance for you these last two yeah they continue

00:58:19.15 you wanna try another take buddy nobody has uh I I kind of wish you reminded me

00:58:23.11 in the during the pleasantries and I could have ordered something

00:58:26.23 I reminded you technically last night when I asked what is everybody's candy

00:58:31.20 I need to do this why didn't you say this that was in the slice chat

00:58:36.11 1210 a.m today it's probably one of the

00:58:39.14 first messages you've seen what candy do we need for tomorrow and which Geoff

00:58:43.07 replied kinder bueno chewy nerds your candy which wouldn't have been helpful

00:58:47.06 to you Gavin so I'd understand if you would have missed that one star burst

00:58:52.00 choose only the reds now you seem to say a different product Geoff

00:58:55.11 is it okay that I just have star burst minis and I've I qualified like just the

00:58:59.20 reds is what you're saying I have a bag of all of them so here's the deal I

00:59:04.12 wasn't aware I first started buying these at hobby lobby when I was going to

00:59:08.03 buy Christmas stuff and so I just grabbed what I saw I I didn't really

00:59:11.05 look at the package too closely I didn't realize that I was eating flavor reds

00:59:16.08 until the other day I bought a bag of the regular star burst and it tasted like

00:59:20.12 doo doo and then I realized that uh I had gotten the wrong thing so you can

00:59:25.11 achieve the same goal but you just can't eat any of the yellow or orange

00:59:30.09 star burst out of there only pink red and dark red well I I can eat them I just

00:59:34.07 I'm not evaluating as far as mine they're not a part of this well they'll

00:59:37.16 they'll taint your they'll taint the palette

00:59:39.17 here again I'm going to open one of these things you want to pretend that

00:59:44.10 it's you I'll just make the sound ready yeah

00:59:48.19 that was just me opening the I haven't even opened west why are you slurping

00:59:54.02 chuck Gavin drank the wrapper it sounded like what are you doing

00:59:58.19 slurp the rapper why would you do that I have a lot of questions

01:00:04.17 I'm opening up my big chewy nerds I'm opening up

01:00:08.02 all right well I mean this is invalid because we don't have Gavin well I feel

01:00:13.06 like he we didn't have Andrew for the cosmic Chris I'll just do it later oh

01:00:16.23 that's fine that's fine that's a great point that's a great point not a great

01:00:20.23 question but it was a great point I feel like honestly Andre I feel like I

01:00:24.08 haven't spoken to you in a while because ever since I found out you lied to me

01:00:27.09 about halo I didn't I haven't texted you about playing halo [Laughter]

01:00:31.22 are those connected you're not wrong it's been playing alone

01:00:38.00 oh that's sad that's lonely oh these are weird these star burst minis are weird

01:00:43.16 these are [ __ ] weird just pink red and pink red and dark red they just

01:00:48.05 don't look like I'd assume that they would they would look like

01:00:51.16 this they're different than star burst that's what's good about them they're

01:00:55.00 like a unique thing okay they're per they're perfect size they're perfect to

01:00:58.16 chew I'm gonna get some of your sour I'm

01:01:01.00 gonna get four sowie nerds I'm gonna get four regular nerds although I know what

01:01:04.14 mine tastes so do you you know roughly like how big this bag is right yeah I

01:01:09.07 mean I assume it's the same size as mine

01:01:13.01 is 191 grams is that how big your bag is uh mine is uh 99 grams

01:01:17.02 so mine's big mine's bigger than yours don't brag about it

01:01:20.08 no I'm just that's gonna I think I could eat all these at once oh I've already

01:01:24.09 eaten a bag of them today just while we've been sitting here no I mean it's

01:01:27.20 at the same time like a one mouthful you just please take the yellow

01:01:31.20 please take the yellow and no no no no it's gonna ruin it I took out the reds

01:01:35.08 to review separately I'm just gonna try this we're gonna just put so you're

01:01:39.06 starting off by eating everything that's remaining

01:01:42.03 wrong eat the [ __ ] I don't want you to eat yeah it's gonna cleanse it's gonna

01:01:46.23 taste like [ __ ] yeah that's what I'm saying the orange and the yellow is

01:01:50.14 objectively bad it's going to ruin your experience

01:01:54.23 do they bite well they bite no yeah they do actually they're great to chew

01:02:01.16 not the entire [ __ ] bag you idiot put four or five in your mouth and

01:02:07.12 choose like a charm

01:02:11.03 that's [ __ ] guy

01:02:15.07 oh he's getting there these guys come back up air

01:02:19.01 they do not have the texture you expect them to yeah now how about you eat the

01:02:23.20 ones I asked you to I thought they'd be chewy they aren't they're not chewy of

01:02:27.21 course no they're they're they're not like gummy chewy I thought they'd be

01:02:31.22 gummy chewy what kind of chewy are they they're still starbursty they're like 85

01:02:38.12 percent as chewy as star or like as they're like a little bit softer and a

01:02:42.00 little bit more chewy than a star burst but not by much

01:02:45.16 but it's nice and they're small so they're like

01:02:48.08 they're like I would say one of these things is maybe a quarter the size of

01:02:52.10 one star burst I think these are better snacking candy

01:02:55.06 I'll give you that yeah I didn't if I was in the mood for star burst I'd take

01:02:58.14 these over over the other time I will never eat another star burst again

01:03:02.18 I will only have these mini star bursts do not try to eat the whole bag at one

01:03:06.23 this is terrible I'm gonna try well I don't know what my [ __ ] tastes like I'm

01:03:11.00 gonna try your sour big chewy nerds it's like all of my saliva is gummy

01:03:15.16 flavored right now but they're not gummy in texture not

01:03:19.17 gummy in texture no just my entire mouth tastes like oh this is not good I like

01:03:25.14 your big sour nerds they're not sour they're way better

01:03:28.06 they're way better than the base nerds I like the base chewy nerds better I

01:03:31.19 think big chewy nerds in the yellow package but these are pretty good

01:03:36.15 if only we had a third person to make rulings on things oops

01:03:41.02 have you had these candies Eric uh yeah I don't I don't think I've had a kinder

01:03:46.08 bueno but I know what Geoff's thing is I like him why'd you say it like it was

01:03:51.07 filth because kinder bueno seems like a non-American candy

01:03:54.22 but how does Albania feel about the kinder boy because there's a commercial

01:03:58.09 for kinder bueno I think where a guy's riding his bicycle and I think it's

01:04:02.21 clear that it's not they're trying to pass it off like

01:04:06.06 oh we filmed this here and it's not it's a foreign commercial you can tell you

01:04:09.22 just look at it and be like this isn't this isn't right yeah so I vote Geoff's

01:04:13.09 candy is the winner yeah there we go there's my there's the pile of candy

01:04:18.15 that's a really [ __ ] photo Geoff I don't know why that's what we've established

01:04:23.20 just the worst photo taker I'm just happy that it's centered like I

01:04:27.09 don't understand what's going on with that photo or where that photo came from

01:04:31.01 that's not the photo what do you mean you just took it and posted it here's

01:04:35.11 the photo I took and posted I don't understand why it came out differently

01:04:40.17 what are you talking about those are separate images

01:04:44.11 I must have taken the other one without even realizing it it took like a what

01:04:49.05 I'm putting my phone back in my pocket phone

01:04:52.07 I'm putting my phone back in my pocket photo for sure all right I'm gonna try

01:04:55.06 this kindergarten oh it is sideways you're right that is I'm putting the

01:05:00.06 phone back down yeah that's incredible and you just sent it without even

01:05:05.03 looking at it that could have been bad I'm glad you're wearing pants

01:05:08.07 well I just like the most recent photo because that's the one I thought I took

01:05:11.12 I wasn't really

01:05:14.23 this is nice which one do you want the kinder bueno it has like a it's a

01:05:20.08 really creamy chocolate and then the wafer is really it's really uh light

01:05:25.21 it's a really light wafer right here it's made by the same people

01:05:30.17 as the uh ferrero people I think it's the same don't they own Nutella

01:05:36.11 that was weird to me to discover roche company owns Nutella because

01:05:41.09 Nutella to me doesn't at all fit the tone of that

01:05:45.05 company like for a roche is like a fancy ass chocolate in my head

01:05:49.16 yeah you buy a thrill for like three quid feels like a kid's candy

01:05:54.05 like it feels like a child spread I could have phrased that better but

01:05:59.02 like a schoolyard I'm just gonna give up describe what I think Nutella tell us

01:06:05.03 that's the episode title a child's spread [Music]

01:06:09.07 all right so we'll we'll our uh we'll need to get these

01:06:13.15 candies to Gavin so he can be the final determiner um I'm gonna go ahead and go

01:06:19.05 one to four I'm gonna go uh mini star burst all the reds number

01:06:24.13 one kinder boy no close second third uh the yellow bag of nerds

01:06:28.19 fourth Andrews candy no offense I'd like you to do it in the least tense order

01:06:33.23 no suspense involved do you really care do you want me to go

01:06:38.17 back to do it the other way all right coming into fourth place

01:06:42.14 I like it a lot it's my least favorite of the bunch but I still thought it was

01:06:46.06 really good I'm still gonna eat it all the time I'm still a fan I'm still a

01:06:49.10 Stan don't get me wrong but you gotta have a best and you gotta have the worst

01:06:53.09 of the bunch worst of the bunch for me number four

01:06:56.12 sour big chewy nerds coming in just a little bit edging out the sour big chewy

01:07:01.16 nerds it's gonna be the yellow bag of nerds that's right in third place bronze

01:07:06.19 medal goes to big chewy nerds no sour then it was a tight tight tight race

01:07:11.12 between silver and gold very tight race the Olympics has not seen a race this

01:07:15.07 tight in the years right but coming in at number two runner-up in

01:07:19.14 case number one can't fulfill its duties as the best candy in the world number

01:07:24.13 two kinder bueno which leaves number one mini star burst all the red [Music]

01:07:32.23 what is what is the reverse of the sound cream because that's what that was

01:07:38.12 that was equally we didn't that was that's not needed

01:07:44.02 you got what you asked for I agree well that's like the reverse of a salad cream

01:07:49.05 like you delivered but it was equally once again I don't need the tux off to

01:07:52.17 the wedding nick and Eric both liked it thank you guys either was good too I'm a

01:07:57.09 fan but it's just a reverse of sound cream

01:08:00.01 you mean you mean I did the opposite of what you did with the salad cream well

01:08:03.19 thanks for that compliment I appreciate it buddy I guess it is a compliment I

01:08:07.22 guess this is a weird way I didn't mean it as one but I guess I did just

01:08:12.13 compliment you I wasn't intended to be that is that the first unintended

01:08:17.18 unenthusiastic compliment we've had in face you can't take it back it was a

01:08:21.15 compliment it's a regulation compliment it's on the books it's official honorary

01:08:26.15 2022

01:08:27.23 regulation compliment Eric Eric is our judge he said it Schwartz nick said it

01:08:32.23 as well congratulations to me what'd you even

01:08:36.00 call that like a side-handed compliment a sidewise compliment yeah sideways

01:08:41.11 compliment fun fact about the sidewise compliment

01:08:45.16 uh dusty baker invented it in like 1985.

01:08:50.00 Interesting yeah that's a great fact I like that this podcast started as a

01:08:54.02 baseball podcast about a baseball player that we no longer ever talk about or

01:08:58.06 mentioned and that's what the show is named after

01:09:02.04 on our list of baseball people wait are you not doing your list of

01:09:05.10 candy who cares about my list I can't top what Geoff just did he reversed salad

01:09:09.14 creamed it I can't do anything better than that but I can't

01:09:14.04 goddamn it all right well if nobody else is going to review the candy then I get

01:09:19.17 to declare mini star burst all the reds well I want to hear andrew's [ __ ] too

01:09:24.12 and then I need you to tie break it Gavin and then we may have to get nick

01:09:27.19 and Eric involved well where did you could you go through the list again and

01:09:31.12 where you ranked them because I don't want it

01:09:34.13 a rank of four here's what we're gonna do we're gonna assign a point value to

01:09:40.12 each one the first first place gets four

01:09:43.05 points third place second place gets two or three

01:09:45.07 because you see what I'm saying yeah yeah you've andrewed me all up all right

01:09:50.12 so four points right now four points right now for mini star burst

01:09:54.02 flavor reds uh three points for a kinder bueno we've got two points for the big

01:09:58.15 chewy nerds and then one point for the sour big chickens so I then we'll have

01:10:02.20 system only works if we anonymously submit beforehand because I'm gonna put

01:10:08.12 four points on the sour nerds because I just I want them in and that's fine

01:10:12.03 I'm putting one point on the star burst because it currently has four

01:10:16.17 I'll just do the reverse of what Geoff has done you're a fool why am I a fool

01:10:22.09 now see here's the problem I asked for honest evaluations yeah handy and Andrew

01:10:28.14 has gamified it well no listen no be quiet for a second you

01:10:33.11 idiot you just said you wanted Gavin to be the tiebreaker stupid if I give four

01:10:39.03 to your number one then there's no tie break we don't need the other number I

01:10:45.02 said he's there to be the tiebreaker if we need it but I misheard that I

01:10:49.03 apologize that's on me that's just a direct apology I didn't hear that part I

01:10:53.14 missed that part of what you said I apologize number four

01:10:57.06 I would make if we're doing a genuine review that was a regulation apology and

01:11:01.12 this is going to be a regulation review in this moment I'm going to be honest

01:11:04.14 about my opinions of all of you in the same scoring system I'm doing the same

01:11:09.11 scoring system but I'm going to do it should no

01:11:12.23 no not that okay do I go lowest first do I build to what my number one is number

01:11:18.06 number one one getting one point the lowest on this totem pole is to me

01:11:24.04 the standard nerds that was a great burp that I threw in at the same time a

01:11:29.10 little extra for you on the side I'm going with the gummy nerds number one

01:11:33.01 because there is a superior version of it wait number four number one number

01:11:38.13 one one point getting one point at the bottom number four no

01:11:43.01 no it's not number four number four no okay we're getting these all mixed up

01:11:48.12 I'm giving you no it's coming in at number four but it's getting one point

01:11:53.16 on the list okay one point coming in at four with one point

01:11:58.17 is the ner the standard nerds the regular yellow bag nerds the yellow bag nerds

01:12:04.11 one point fourth place coming in at third place is the star burst shoes I

01:12:10.11 just did not the biggest star burst fan I don't really care for them but they're

01:12:14.17 good like for what they are they're good I think that's the best version of

01:12:17.22 star burst they've innovated on a thing that I didn't realize they could

01:12:21.14 innovate on I give them credit they get two points in third place

01:12:25.01 in second place with three points is the kinder bueno

01:12:29.10 they're good wow I'm never gonna look at

01:12:31.14 these but I'll never be sad that they're

01:12:33.12 there and number one because I picked it it's like obviously a bias my favorite

01:12:38.00 personal candy is the sour nerds I'm giving that four points

01:12:42.17 so that gives us a two a two place Thai a two two candy pie for first right now

01:12:46.17 right with the star burst having four points for me and two for you that gives

01:12:50.08 them six and then my kinder bueno and your kinder bueno both coming in with

01:12:53.20 three points each gives them six so Gavin will have to be the deciding

01:12:58.17 factor uh we'll have to get these candies to him I wonder what she will pick

01:13:04.21 oh his favorite candy or some other candy well never tried the other ones he

01:13:09.22 hasn't tried him that's fair and also if if I think that the kinder bueno is

01:13:14.13 the second best candy and you think the kinder bueno is the second best candy

01:13:19.01 and Gavin truly thinks it's the best candy then it is clearly the winner I

01:13:24.17 don't I feel like this is gonna because I don't I can we all agree

01:13:29.16 outside of Gavin the kinder bueno is not the best candy

01:13:34.10 it's a very good candy but it's not the best candy that's what he put up dude we

01:13:38.14 can only know what he gives I underst this is what's gonna [ __ ] happen

01:13:43.05 though what is that Denzel Washington train movie money train no

01:13:47.12 it's not that it's not the taking of pelham one two three

01:13:51.07 what was the name of on unbreakable no what was

01:13:55.08 what's the name of it Bruce Willis no it's Chris pine and Denzel Washington

01:13:59.22 and tony Scott movie I watched that movie on mute on a plane

01:14:04.06 once I didn't hear a single word to the center but I watched unstoppable thanks

01:14:09.20 we have an unstoppable problem with this candy thing

01:14:14.23 nick said training day if you go on let me pull it up

01:14:18.15 I think unstoppable has like a 90 on rotten tomatoes but nobody thinks it's

01:14:23.20 great it's just universally like that was a totally fine movie like it's solid

01:14:28.23 like it's solid nobody hates it has an 87 that is not an 87 percent

01:14:33.14 movie yeah can I just say if you are a regulation listener or a comment leaver

01:14:38.20 or your regulation listener who would like to become a comment leaver let us

01:14:42.04 know how you feel about unstoppable is it your favorite train movie is it your

01:14:47.09 favorite movie is Andrew wrong are there hardcore

01:14:50.03 pine and Washington train stands out there we want to know what is my

01:14:54.07 favorite train movie hmm I didn't like the taking of palm one

01:14:58.08 two three but I haven't seen the original one was not great was that no piercer

01:15:04.04 it's a good train movie the speed count uh why would speed be a train movie yeah

01:15:09.15 because it ends on a train yeah but it's not the point of the movie

01:15:13.08 is not the train what about the core that's sort of a train that goes into

01:15:17.13 the earth that's an earth train that's a great bad movie what was that gene

01:15:22.20 wilder uh train oh yeah silver streak with uh gene

01:15:30.02 wilder is that a train move and Richard pryor

01:15:33.05 yeah that was a train movie although that movie is from the 70s and it's a it

01:15:38.12 was an edgy comedy so it probably hasn't held up well

01:15:42.22 in terms of being problematic I remember the seed that you're referring to

01:15:48.01 yes yes yes yes yes also if you guys would look I noted I

01:15:52.02 posted a picture of the sour big chewy nerds

01:15:54.16 I don't know if you guys noticed it but doesn't it look like that nerd is taking

01:15:58.05 a is is [ __ ] out a pink it does like doesn't that seem like they should

01:16:01.22 have noticed they should have caught that

01:16:04.07 bottom rung of a set of anal beads yeah it really does seem like he's he's got

01:16:08.08 the last anal bead sticking out you you think they would have caught that I

01:16:12.01 would argue I would argue that the the big chewy one is even worse Geoff

01:16:17.16 I ripped unfortunately where if you could look oh big Chewie oh on

01:16:22.08 the right it is right yes it is like shooting out of his ass like it is

01:16:27.06 halfway out it looks like he just took a [ __ ] and

01:16:31.00 the pink one please it's a hemorrhoid he's got a hemorrhoid yeah let's get

01:16:34.13 this picture I can't see and then eric's gonna lose his mind if

01:16:37.12 we don't stop talking so I'll add that up uh I'll add this and we'll end it

01:16:40.14 also we should mention while I'm uploading this uh tiki mugs are on sale

01:16:44.09 now unless they've already sold out Eric and I did a ton of videos and promo for

01:16:48.15 them the other day they had just the nicest time together uh there you go

01:16:53.14 oh it looks like a little uh he's licking his lips he's so happy it's like

01:16:58.10 somebody pushed this thing back in looks like a little great wait

01:17:01.23 are they nerds are we eating those is this the yeah we're eating we're

01:17:07.07 eating nerd [ __ ]

01:17:08.19 well no that's not what I meant but that's also terrible well what what did you

01:17:14.07 mean are we eating the physical nerds
