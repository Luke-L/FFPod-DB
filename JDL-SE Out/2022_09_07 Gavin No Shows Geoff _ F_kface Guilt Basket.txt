00:01:38.02 was telling them gav in the in the uh pleasantries I had prepared a little

00:01:43.23 photo essay for today and then it expanded in ways that I did not

00:01:49.03 anticipate um did it expand due to my recent visit

00:01:53.01 it might have that might be a part of it and I'd like to

00:01:57.06 so I'd like to begin a story and then pause the story and then come

00:02:01.17 back to the story at the end if I can okay

00:02:04.23 uh I'd like to play a little game with you guys where I'm gonna send some

00:02:08.11 photos out and I'll see if you can tell what's going on uh.

00:02:14.06 I had to make a special directory on my phone just for all the face books first

00:02:18.11 off I gotta let you guys know right now I'm a little loopy I'm a little tired I

00:02:22.12 have not been sleeping well I've been sleeping in my office all week oh no what

00:02:28.20 yeah we got some troop shelves going up yeah we do we do we have bedroom shelves

00:02:34.01 going up and let me show you uh here [ __ ] where's the album here we go

00:02:38.19 you had it all right so I can't sleep and I can't sleep in my bedroom

00:02:43.22 right now because of this we're getting uh

00:02:47.07 we're getting [ __ ] put on the wall I don't know what to call that wall

00:02:52.04 mentally close yeah you're like like trim done triple a

00:02:56.06 wall like ornate wall trim now it's not going to be white I sent you guys a

00:03:00.15 photo it's a blue dart so the color is called bedroom boudoir it's a very dull

00:03:05.02 uh it's been that cover forever color ever but I'm getting

00:03:08.09 we wanted to get those added in to fancy it up and really make it pop yeah like

00:03:12.12 nick said uh so that'll be all the same color it won't be so so it won't stand

00:03:17.07 out as much and my ceiling has a bunch of like

00:03:19.15 popcorn on it not exactly popcorn but uh like 90s weird texture that's just so

00:03:24.02 [ __ ] gross and every night when I fall to sleep the last thing I see is

00:03:27.18 a really bad decision somebody made in the mid-90s

00:03:32.02 we decided to to fix the walls and do that at the same time so they're like

00:03:36.01 removing all the texture from the ceiling and then they're gonna paint it

00:03:39.20 the same color as the walls so my bedroom will be like a sex cave uh and

00:03:43.20 uh I'm pretty jazzed about it but because of that uh everything that lived

00:03:47.00 in my bedroom has to be everywhere else in my house so my king-size bed is I'm

00:03:51.12 currently backed up against it in in the

00:03:53.16 library right now so for why we had like 40 episodes where I was doing the

00:03:57.14 podcast for my bedroom now the bedroom came to me

00:04:01.03 uncomfortable you realize how different the temperature is from room to room in

00:04:04.22 an old house oh yeah it's way hotter on this side on

00:04:07.16 Millie side of the house than my side I get what she's been bitching about for

00:04:10.22 so long [Laughter]

00:04:13.09 so I'm a little out I'm a little out of sorts because of that let me start send

00:04:18.08 you the next photo and this is where the game begins okay

00:04:22.03 and I should just say anyone who wants to follow along if you watch on our

00:04:25.18 YouTube or the roosters site you will see the photos as they pop in they will

00:04:29.00 also be posted on our social media feeds there's a yes absolutely please play

00:04:33.04 along that that's a photo uh you guys will see it's a it's a me and Emily uh

00:04:38.19 I look unhappy but that's not for any reason other than

00:04:41.19 I take bad photos and so I make that face in every photo I figure if I get

00:04:46.02 ahead of it and I own the bad photo then

00:04:48.08 it becomes me it's my thing and so Emily looks beautiful and I look constipated

00:04:53.20 that's by design uh so get guess what we're doing there uh

00:04:57.13 and then here's the next here's the next photo see if you can this is the the

00:05:02.06 mystery what do you think is going on in this photo [Laughter]

00:05:08.02 what do you think is happening there

00:05:12.21 what so by the way for audience if you haven't gone on the Instagram yet it's a

00:05:18.13 photo of a of a table with two empty chairs and then

00:05:21.19 there's a group of people uh sitting at a table in the in the background for

00:05:26.21 Andrew Eric and nick I I know what he's uh gone for here I'm

00:05:30.06 wondering if uh you guys Gavin yeah no chance I'm trying to I'm trying to well

00:05:33.22 is it possible I'm gonna guess with the first photo that you somehow had the

00:05:37.12 cameras reversed potentially that you thought it was forward-facing and was

00:05:41.15 okay facing okay you're over thinking it a bit uh if anybody else is out does

00:05:45.18 anybody else want to guess before I just answer it nick thinks that was it as

00:05:49.12 well yes Eric the photos are definitely related same restaurant same table if

00:05:53.20 the photos are related does it have to do the way you described it does it have

00:05:57.22 to do with the two empty chairs oh yeah yeah yeah you're really you're keying in

00:06:03.01 on on what's going on here uh I'm not impact taking a photo of the

00:06:06.12 the group of people behind me I don't know and I will never know I am taking a

00:06:10.20 photo of the two empty chairs why would I be taking a photo of two empty chairs

00:06:16.10 I'm gonna say that uh you're supposed to have a wonderful meal with Gavin and uh

00:06:22.13 I'd assume meg guessing and they no showed would be my

00:06:26.02 guess based off of the clues that we've gathered so far it is unbelievable that

00:06:32.06 mere days after we have to have a preemptive conversation

00:06:36.06 about having an intervention for someone's goddamn lateness he no shows

00:06:40.19 me at a double date dinner on a Saturday night

00:06:44.04 I thought I thought I thought I love this guy I love his girlfriend the best

00:06:49.07 friends in the world I need to spend more time with people I'm such a hermit

00:06:53.21 I made the effort I I Emily made a reservation for this Japanese barbecue

00:06:58.03 place where it's kind of like hot pop but you just like it's like a big hot

00:07:01.03 rock in the middle and you just cook all your food right there

00:07:04.08 kind of new we were excited about it I texted Gavin on like a Thursday and I

00:07:08.04 said hey I got reservations on 7 p.m on Saturday for this place uh

00:07:11.06 do you want to go with us Emily will make the reservations and he's like

00:07:15.07 we're in absolutely send him the reservations the whole thing

00:07:19.16 Saturday night seven o'clock I sit down

00:07:22.21 and I think oh [ __ ] he's not gonna show and emily's like what has he ever no

00:07:26.23 show dinner before and I go no but I just have a feeling he's not gonna

00:07:30.21 show up and she's like that's ridiculous by 705 I knew it so I texted him and I

00:07:35.05 said hey buddy and by at about 708 Gavin text back

00:07:42.20 [ __ ] completely no showed our double date I don't know what's wrong with me I

00:07:48.06 don't know I don't know what's going on this is I've never done that before so

00:07:53.07 you have no excuse you just forgot you just never happened

00:07:57.07 I I guess I just didn't click the thing in the email because I think that makes

00:08:01.03 you a calendar invite what did what I did instead was I set a reminder on my

00:08:06.15 phone but all that does is just put a reminder on my

00:08:10.11 screen when I look at it it didn't actually go like hey did it tonight so

00:08:15.23 when I got the text message not only did I see Geoff saying hey I

00:08:20.14 also saw the reminder just sat there for

00:08:22.21 the exact time that I was looking at and I was just in like a home depot across

00:08:28.04 town and I was with meg we were just getting some stuff and I was just like

00:08:33.16 oh no oh my goodness in the middle of the home depot I was like

00:08:37.11 and she was like oh my god can we make it I was like no we even if we leave

00:08:42.15 right this second we'll be half an hour late [Laughter]

00:08:46.14 complete nightmare okay everything's falling apart

00:08:50.17 I I I'm being a hundred percent honest when I tell you that I was so [ __ ]

00:08:55.22 happy because of this because I knew you had

00:09:00.19 just given us podcast material which I infinitely appreciated also

00:09:05.09 as much as I love you and meg an opportunity not to talk to people in my

00:09:10.02 life at this point is always greater than an opportunity to talk to people so

00:09:13.12 it was like totally fine we had a lovely little dinner also Japanese barbecue

00:09:17.06 where you make your own food [ __ ]

00:09:19.07 great we should all go there together sometimes I would love to I was really

00:09:23.14 excited about it

00:09:26.08 that's fascinating Gavin is slipping this is a real interesting problem it's

00:09:32.04 on a much lower scale but just I wasn't even gonna bring it up but with this

00:09:35.12 story Gavin texted me yesterday that you're gonna you're gonna text me

00:09:40.18 back in two hours still haven't got a text from Kevin I think the last episode

00:09:46.10 that aired we talked about how Ezra made both of us wait like three hours for

00:09:52.23 dinner at different times immediately I think we even set when it's too late

00:09:57.01 to go to the dinner and I think 30

00:10:00.02 minutes would have been okay under what we ruled I think a lot he he wouldn't

00:10:03.19 have made it in 30 minutes uh in Austin I was on the east side of town he would

00:10:07.18 have been [ __ ]

00:10:10.00 uh yes I mean I I've been I've been busy with

00:10:13.09 like trying to get filming ready and you know I got down here and stuff so I'm a

00:10:16.17 little bit more scatterbrained than normal but that is no excuse and that is

00:10:20.17 something like a little cheeky double date with Geoff and Emily and meg what's

00:10:24.22 better than that in a week that's like I was looking forward to it yeah me too

00:10:29.08 there's no reason I'll tell you this I had an opportunity

00:10:32.23 the next weekend because this was two weeks ago uh dinner was [ __ ]

00:10:36.12 amazing Eric we gotta go there sometime uh I had an opportunity the next weekend

00:10:39.15 to get dinner and I invited Trevor and Barbara instead

00:10:43.07 because I knew they'd show up and they did they totally showed up it was fine

00:10:48.17 uh I felt I was and for the record gav list

00:10:52.02 out of everybody in the world before I I don't want to beat you up too much out

00:10:56.10 of everybody in the world who understands being busy and scatterbrained

00:11:00.23 it's me I get I was not offended in any way I wasn't upset you didn't actually

00:11:05.11 hurt my feelings Emily and I laughed about it for 30 minutes straight we just

00:11:10.04 joked about how I would talk about the podcast we decided to do this photo

00:11:13.21 thing it was it became instant instant content which I love all I want

00:11:18.18 to do is live in content anyway right so I swim around in content so it was it

00:11:22.18 was a hundred percent fine uh even before we get to the next phase of that

00:11:28.00 story uh I just want you to know uh irrespective of the the second half uh

00:11:31.21 I it was it was totally okay and you didn't hurt my feelings well I

00:11:35.05 appreciate it I mean I obviously I spent the next four hours feeling pretty bad

00:11:38.06 about it and then uh most of the next morning too but yeah well I want you to

00:11:42.00 feel bad for a while just not forever yeah

00:11:44.10 and I never see Emily either I'm always like I talk to you every week but I'm

00:11:48.15 always really excited to talk to Emily because she really yeah she's great

00:11:51.16 she's way way more interesting than I am yeah

00:11:55.11 so what came next yeah I'm fascinated to see how this builds okay well we're

00:11:59.16 going to take a pause on that story I thought the story was over there but it

00:12:02.23 turns out it wasn't um today it could have continued to surprise me uh first

00:12:06.00 off I was I was going to say also I fully planned to have a working

00:12:10.10 prototype maybe even a commercial of the

00:12:13.16 fruit gloves for you but I realized that while there are like

00:12:17.21 muscular dudes with more tattoos than me doing carpentry in my bedroom looking

00:12:23.13 way cooler than me I'm I cannot stand in my kitchen and velcro a melon baller to

00:12:29.12 the back of my hand it's just like I just I couldn't do it I was I felt so like

00:12:35.01 dumb and emasculated and like unimportant and like embarrassed I just

00:12:39.17 I've been hiding in my library all right

00:12:42.15 it's been so lame um which sucks because it's also where I'm sleeping so I'm

00:12:48.00 spending like 24 hours a day uh in it's like that movie cube I cannot

00:12:52.13 get out of this room to save my life uh anyway so today I

00:12:55.19 decided to go uh all I had really prepped for you guys was that and cause

00:12:59.20 I felt bad about not having the fruit gloves and so I decided to go for a bike

00:13:04.05 ride because sometimes that inspires stories and I thought like maybe I would

00:13:07.21 I would like take you guys along on on a journey on a story with me if I could

00:13:11.04 find some interesting narrative and uh it's my I you know my balls are fine now

00:13:16.03 so I can ride my bike again finally I haven't been because it's been raining

00:13:19.09 but I was very excited to get out on the new bike

00:13:22.10 it's [ __ ] awesome first of all it's just [ __ ] awesome like I cannot say

00:13:26.03 enough good things about this bike I'm in love with it I would marry it if I

00:13:29.09 could uh it's like the greatest thing that's

00:13:31.14 ever happened to me I'm completely I've completely got it figured out now it's

00:13:35.18 so [ __ ] fast which is the part of the problem uh and uh

00:13:40.00 anyway so it was just I was having a great time

00:13:44.04 stumbled into an amazing situation immediately where I rode I rode up on a

00:13:48.23 homeless guy with a big stick who was trying to

00:13:51.13 I don't know he was fighting a retaining wall like he just kept stabbing it over

00:13:55.11 and over again with the stick like he was trying to like trying to puncture

00:13:59.00 this concrete retaining wall and I thought well this is a great photo but

00:14:02.22 he looked at me and then he just like stared at me as I was writing up on him

00:14:06.00 while he continued to poke the retaining wall and yell at it and I was like

00:14:10.01 there's no way I can get around this guy after taking a photo with him and not

00:14:14.00 take take a poke to the eye you know yeah I was like [ __ ] it I guess I guess

00:14:17.17 that's not gonna be a part of the story so uh I ride on I go around town lake

00:14:22.13 and um I I took a photo of how pretty Austin is

00:14:26.06 and this is this is this kind of the story I stumbled upon I took a photo of

00:14:30.00 kind of how pretty Austin is not the best photo of how pretty Austin is but

00:14:33.06 uh it's just a photo here it is I'll show you guys uh for the audience at

00:14:36.12 home uh it's just a picture of town lake uh you can see some of the buildings in

00:14:40.10 the background there's sun there's clouds I'm on I'm clearly on uh like the

00:14:44.17 hike and bike trail nick loves it down there as do I can you

00:14:48.01 from this photo can you guys tell what's wrong with Austin all right

00:14:52.01 is it like the weird layer of scum that's on the lake at the moment let's

00:14:56.13 get a little closer I'm not zero in on an area

00:14:58.22 this photo is not too powerful it's the same [ __ ] photo as all the other

00:15:02.11 photos how's that possible all right let me see if I can skip that one do a

00:15:05.12 different one uh okay so here's a photo zoomed in a little bit oh and

00:15:49.03 water like that's like I've never seen it later

00:15:52.04 well we just had a lot of rain so it's worse than usual but I can tell you

00:15:56.03 because I've been I ride my bike all the time it's been like this for at least a

00:15:59.11 year and here's the [ __ ] here's where it gets

00:16:22.06 uh on the log they're like I can se I watched those

00:16:25.01 stories for about 10 minutes and I could hear their conversation the guy on the

00:16:28.10 right's like amen you jump in and the guy loves like [ __ ] you I'm not going

00:16:32.02 and you go in he's like I'm not going in I went in first last time the turtles

00:16:35.15 are daring each other to get in the water and nobody's brave enough to do it

00:16:40.13 because they [ __ ] know then next to the turtles I saw these [ __ ] guys ducks

00:17:00.10 and friends then this is the ultimate photo right here huh

00:17:05.11 a little bit down I found here's a log here's a log where

00:17:09.05 the turtles and the burr and the ducks are daring each other

00:17:13.03 nobody wants in this [ __ ] water because it is gross and this is why I

00:17:18.02 bring this up I just I was horrified and I thought it was just [ __ ] the

00:17:22.02 grossest thing I've ever seen uh and everybody talks about a beautiful Austin

00:17:26.04 is this weekend actually tomorrow for every Friday Saturday and Sunday in

00:17:30.21 Austin I guaran [ __ I t you it's gonna town lake is

00:17:35.08 gonna look like this in 24 hours that's a picture if you haven't seen it

00:17:39.09 at home uh it's called party island it's where all the stand-up paddle boards get

00:17:43.07 together and they build a little island where they all drink and enjoy the sun

00:17:47.10 and just [ __ ] up and smoke weed and stuff that doesn't sound like fun

00:17:51.05 if you ca for the audience who may not be looking it's got to be I'm guessing

00:17:55.17 500 paddle boards and canoes all sandwiched together on the body of the

00:18:00.10 same body of water where all those ducks in the where the

00:18:05.01 ducks the birds and the [ __ ] turtles are too scared to go in

00:18:09.02 every [ __ ] day I read by the way also the Austin water is so gross right now

00:18:13.15 dogs aren't supposed to go in it there's toxic algae that will kill dogs every

00:18:17.22 day when I ride my bike I see [ __ ]

00:18:19.16 throwing their [ __ ] balls in the water for the golden retrievers these

00:18:23.07 people are killing their dogs it's driving me nuts and

00:18:26.15 also that toxic algae there's another kind of algae that if you touch it it

00:18:30.09 gives you your entire body a rash and all these people are reporting on Reddit

00:18:34.10 and on Instagram they're like what's happening to me I broke out in a rash I

00:18:38.03 don't know after I went paddle boarding stay out of that [ __ ] water dude it

00:18:42.03 is hideous it is gross that's my public service announcement to anybody who

00:18:45.11 wants to visit Austin and get on a stand-up paddle board or rent a canoe

00:18:48.19 because you think town lake is cool it was at some point but it hasn't been in

00:18:53.18 a long time it is a toxic wasteland do you think maybe you

00:18:57.14 got jock itch from that I was about to say dude maybe I did that's a great I

00:19:01.20 don't think I don't think that that's a I'm surprised you haven't made that

00:19:06.04 connection I did it until just now one turtle got

00:19:10.08 and the entire animal kingdom refuses to get in

00:19:13.09 I think it's I'm connected still reeling from jock itch I mean my jock itch came

00:19:18.08 would have come from the other side of the dam well bar ton springs god damn it

00:19:23.01 yeah well let's [ __ ] learn from my

00:19:29.14 you you just gave a public service announcement for yourself without

00:19:34.04 realizing you're the person who did it yes

00:19:37.07 because that's a guy in this situation if there's anything that funnels

00:19:42.14 splashes of water down the side of your thighs towards your groin it's a jet ski

00:19:48.12 that's the ultimate it's the ultimate scrut splash device you just

00:19:53.07 you did all of that toward people not to do the things that you did that learned

00:19:58.02 mistakes for [ __ ] sake dude that is disgusting

00:20:01.18 with like a net and try and get some of that up

00:20:05.21 like a face river cleanup oh no that'd be you would there's no way you could do

00:20:10.15 that you would be so fast yeah there's there's not enough

00:20:13.17 trash cans on earth dude it's and I recognize that we just had a

00:20:17.15 major major rain and it's dumping a lot of trash into the water but I promise

00:20:22.06 you it looked like that last week too it's not

00:20:25.08 yeah I've been noticing that um recently just going over the bridge I noticed

00:20:29.12 that sort of trash island further in the middle yeah it was just floating in the

00:20:34.12 center a few weeks ago I don't know if it's the the 500000 people that moved

00:20:38.07 to Austin in the last 90 days or what but I'm not I'm not trying to be one of

00:20:42.10 those people uh but just just stay out of the [ __ ]

00:20:45.08 water because it's gross and dangerous and keep your pets away from it the

00:20:49.22 ducks don't want anything to do with our water your dog shouldn't either

00:20:54.06 that's a nice public safety yeah that's right that's my little story that's the

00:20:57.09 only story I stumbled upon on my bike oh oh so then I I take all those photos I

00:21:03.03 come around I head I start heading home it's I it's probably an hour later at

00:21:06.21 this point uh from when I drove past the crazy guy poking the stick at the

00:21:10.10 retaining wall I probably I've done a full loop around

00:21:13.03 town lake down to the dam all the way back up to the other end in the back I

00:21:17.11 stop to take photos a bunch and like give my condolences to the

00:21:21.12 [ __ ] ducks and the turtles uh and uh guess who I see in the exact same spot

00:21:26.13 doing the exact same thing the homeless guy is still trying to kill the

00:21:32.09 retaining wall with the giant stick and when I roll up on him I'm pretty far

00:21:36.14 away from him he's already looking at me he's doing the same thing where his his

00:21:40.02 it's his right arm is just like robotically poking it and he's like

00:21:43.21 yelling it might be some sort of an incantation or spell under his breath

00:21:48.13 and he's just staring at me the whole time man let me tell you

00:21:51.13 that was I don't often get intimidated but I didn't enjoy having to drive past

00:21:55.12 that dude in that moment it I mean I did and I was fine he didn't attack because

00:21:59.02 you don't know what he's thinking because I don't know what he's thinking

00:22:03.05 and he's displayed an aggression towards

00:22:06.08 inanimate objects uh on and I'm way more flashy I'm moving uh there's a lot more

00:22:09.17 to look at I'm more colorful than a retaining wall it's way easier like I

00:22:13.05 feel like I would catch his attention like he's obviously transfixed and hates

00:22:17.01 this concrete I don't know what he would do to me right so uh anyway uh once

00:22:21.08 again did not take a photo of this dude because I'm pretty sure he would have

00:22:24.10 killed me uh and then we'd be you guys would be [ __ ] you guys would be right

00:22:29.01 now trying to put a podcast together making fun of me for being

00:22:32.03 20 minutes late to my own podcast and I'm late because I'm either dead or in

00:22:36.08 the emergency room boy would you feel bad uh

00:22:39.09 anyway so then the last p what I thought

00:22:41.16 was the last piece I thought that was it I thought that was one of my photos I

00:22:45.01 was gonna share with you I'm gonna share one more with you that happened on the

00:22:49.09 way home that's the owie I got from the first bike rack on my new bike

00:22:53.20 is that your knee it's a stinger dude it's my knee yeah did you come off

00:23:00.22 oh yeah I [ __ ] my I'm not even I'm not even gonna be brave dude I'll I

00:23:06.12 I I sniffled a little bit when I did it.

00:23:12.00 I was like I was going like maybe 12 or 14 miles an hour and I was crossing a

00:23:17.20 four-way and uh I was actually in a bike lane but you know how like

00:23:22.17 like they have like raised curbs I just I guess I was just like

00:23:26.08 just going a little too close to the curb and you know how like sometimes if

00:23:30.02 you're like you're turning hard and your your pedal might hit the ground and

00:23:33.06 it'll just scrape and like grab you a little bit you keep going well that kind

00:23:36.15 of happened but it was with the curb except I guess I was going fast enough and

00:23:40.21 and the pedal must have just got hooked into the curb so that my whole

00:23:46.08 bike just hit it and did an immediate left turn like the whole thing just

00:23:52.03 swung around like on a stripper pole and sent the right half of my body one way

00:23:57.11 and the left half of my body on the other way and I landed

00:24:01.00 I landed on my knee right there with my body pushed to the right so I sprained

00:24:05.21 my knee to the right brutally but as I was doing that it was

00:24:09.22 the momentum was pulling me away so my legs shot out the other direction and so

00:24:15.06 my left ankle got sprained going left so like I've got a right sprain on my left

00:24:20.09 knee and a left sprain on my left ankle so it's almost impossible to walk it

00:24:24.12 hurts like there's no there's nothing I can favor you know like if I go like oh

00:24:27.11 I'll just walk on the left a little bit then it just hurts the knee if I go I'll

00:24:30.23 walk on the right a little bit it hurts the ankle uh also the one thing I'm

00:24:36.00 trying not to do right now is is cause too much damage to my balls

00:24:40.13 uh because I'm I'm still I'm barely four

00:24:43.14 weeks past the the vasectomy I racked my balls so [ __ ] hard on my bike

00:24:48.08 I saw purple like the world went purple for a second just from the ball pain I

00:24:53.05 had to get over the ball pain before I could even assess my knee and my leg and

00:24:58.06 then I had to ride my bike home it [ __ ] hurt and it hurt did you not sit

00:25:02.02 on the bar in the middle of the bike yeah yeah yeah yeah dude I almost like

00:25:08.19 you know how like your balls are connected to your tongue all the way

00:25:13.12 through your body like I hit my balls so [ __ ] hard I

00:25:17.05 could feel like my throat was trying to eat my tongue

00:25:22.06 it hurts so bad oh it's reeling your tongue down your throat yeah and then

00:25:27.10 and then as that subsided a little bit and I realized that I probably hadn't

00:25:30.12 like broken my dick in somewhere that I needed to go the emergency room for to

00:25:34.17 get re you know reaffixed uh just all the [ __ ] leg pain really

00:25:38.19 really hit me uh so knocked that out got got past my first bike rack on the new

00:25:43.06 bike bike did swimmingly well by the way it didn't even not a scratch on it uh I

00:25:48.00 I think my body took all of the scratches uh

00:25:51.08 so I thought that was the end I thought that was the end of of my photo I

00:25:54.21 thought like oh cool I get one more photo out of the day for these guys that

00:25:58.07 I can share with them and then before you move on what was what's now the

00:26:01.13 integrity of your ankle because obviously andrew's at 100 yeah I'd love

00:26:06.02 to hear yeah somebody who's a hunter moment

00:26:08.16 I would say my knee is at like sixty percent maybe and my ankle is at like

00:26:14.06 thirty five percent oh yeah like I'm pretty I'm pretty hard

00:26:18.13 limping right now okay yeah I can't really bend it um so I'm

00:26:23.01 I'm a little bummed out I'm bummed out because uh I hate to see Austin look

00:26:28.06 gross I hate my city to be gross I hate that I rode around my favorite spot for

00:26:34.10 45 or two hours today and I was just assaulted by the smell of like

00:26:38.23 [ __ ] gross trash and mildew and like human theses and stale booze and it

00:26:44.10 just it was so [ __ ] gross today I was really it was a real bummer um and for

00:26:48.20 for those of you people that are like well if you if you hate it so much do

00:26:52.04 something about it I go and pick up trash in my neighborhood park like three

00:26:55.06 times a month uh I try to do I I do try to do my part um anyway so I get home

00:27:00.05 feeling a little dejected and pretty sore and bummed that I gotta go hide in

00:27:05.00 my library next to my bed where I have like one inch to move around uh because

00:27:09.19 I'm definitely not feeling like a cool guy that wants to hang out in his house

00:27:13.22 around a bunch of way cooler dudes who are doing hard work that I'm paying him

00:27:18.02 to do while I'd [ __ ] hide like a troll uh and this was on my front door oh

00:27:23.09 huh and then I got a text from Gavin that said uh you have a package

00:27:27.20 so I was like what I went to that and then here so here's I wanted to get

00:27:33.04 my I wanted to get the full story so here's my face

00:27:37.02 uh I want Gavin I wanted you to see my my actual reaction so here's my face

00:27:42.00 when I realized that you sent me flowers uh and a gold a gold some sort of a

00:27:47.03 golden package I was like I was like what yeah that's me

00:27:51.09 so then I open it up and there's a [ __ ] I won't show you the inside of

00:27:56.09 the card because it's very personal uh well it's not that personal but

00:28:01.20 it sounds cooler if I say that uh there's a card that says face guilt

00:28:05.08 basket which I thought was really sweet are they really really really sweet

00:28:10.17 and then inside of it was uh not just the flowers the roses and stuff

00:28:16.12 uh Gavin and meg also got us uh tiff's treats which is a local awesome cookie

00:28:21.12 company that everybody loves and my favorite ice cream cookie two-step

00:28:25.10 bluebell cookie two-step I couldn't believe you remembered and you got my

00:28:29.15 favorite ice cream I [ __ ] love you for that I also um I ordered the tiff's

00:28:34.21 treats came with a little jar of milk and I made sure to remove

00:28:38.09 that because you hate it.

00:28:40.13 I do hate milk and then I realized that the ice cream and the cookies were

00:28:45.13 sitting on top of something and I thought it was just like padding but I

00:28:49.11 took the rest of the box apart and they were hiding this which I guess was the

00:28:53.12 real gift

00:28:57.11 you gave Geoff a ps5 because you missed your

00:29:00.19 dinner Gavin bought me a ps5 I haven't owned a PlayStation since the ps2

00:29:06.12 I can't believe it I'm so excited look I thought I would hit the guilt basket

00:29:12.05 hard I thought I'd go all right nick said to Kevin do you want to go to dinner.

00:29:17.16 I thought I don't want you to not invite

00:29:20.13 me to dinner again because uh my like my you know integrity is falling apart so

00:29:25.04 here's a little make good and also this was a double whammy for me because

00:29:29.12 I remember a time obviously you're not a PlayStation guy you're a massive Xbox

00:29:34.00 guy and I remember a time when Bernie gave you a ps3 and you were annoyed

00:29:39.07 like back in the day like maybe like 14

00:29:41.22 years ago or something you just had a ps3 on your desk you like what and you

00:29:47.05 were like annoyed like moving in unplugging it so I thought I wonder if

00:29:50.09 you have the same reaction to a ps5

00:29:52.16 no it meant the world to me actually here's my actual reaction I took another

00:29:57.03 photo after the ps5

00:29:59.20 that's my final photo that's my that's my ps5 face no it's [ __ ] it's

00:30:03.11 incredibly sweet I needed it I love it I've thought about buying one a few

00:30:07.13 times because people keep telling me that I specifically would love horizon

00:30:12.21 zero dawn and horizon forbidden west or whatever and uh and then

00:30:16.15 you got it for me and now like dude I was actually thinking like I'm never

00:30:20.11 gonna be a streamer but if I ever was I was trying to figure out what my angle

00:30:23.13 would be and I thought like maybe my s my my streaming uh angle could be I play

00:30:28.19 all the PlayStation games that I've never played uncharted god of war [ __ ]

00:30:33.23 I don't know there's probably others the spider-man game everybody loved uh what

00:30:39.14 other big Sony properties are there gran turismo

00:30:42.17 ghost of sashima yeah that's everybody loves that game uh and uh now I can now

00:30:48.19 I have access to all this uh you've opened my world up Gavin

00:30:52.11 I thank you so much I I really appreciate it you have no idea how much

00:30:56.02 it means hey you're welcome it's incredibly generous this is a

00:30:59.08 wonderful thing I think my favorite part of it is if you look at the first photo

00:31:03.18 with the where it is like on the doorstep it kind of looks like they used

00:31:07.15 a tablecloth from a restaurant like it really ties it all together like the

00:31:12.09 bagginess of it I just see tablecloth from it all it works perfectly I don't

00:31:17.01 know what you um don't really get from these pictures is the fact that on the

00:31:20.19 way to deliver it uh meg took quite a harsh left turn and it all went flying

00:31:26.00 across the car and all the water from the flowers spilled across all of our

00:31:29.15 back seats and on the PlayStation that you might need to top up that verse

00:31:33.18 but I'll definitely top up the vase than that I think it all got there in

00:31:37.09 one piece that's fine but did she make a harsh

00:31:39.23 left turn to dodge the dude who wrecked his bicycle

00:31:44.00 and uh I think this works for you because uh you know you you're the first

00:31:49.12 recipient of my guilt basket and it also works for me in that I've now set that

00:31:53.14 as a standard for me missing an event and I don't want to have to go through

00:31:57.13 buying all this [ __ ] every time yeah keep me on my toes keep me on time and

00:32:02.06 uh keep me in attendance well here's what I can recommend to anybody who

00:32:06.01 listens to this podcast uh make every opportunity you can to make plans with

00:32:09.22 Gavin [Laughter]

00:32:12.13 every opportunity you have make plans with Gavin and don't be one of those

00:32:16.17 people who nags him and reminds them I actually thought on Saturday in the

00:32:19.16 middle of the day I thought I just didn't gave a text like can't wait for

00:32:23.04 tonight you know looking forward to hanging out and I thought nah that's lame

00:32:28.15 and it turns out it was lame because it got me a ps5

00:32:31.12 and I figured if you if uh if it'll just sit and rock behind your tv you could

00:32:34.17 just give it to Millie I'll give it to somebody like no dude I'm gonna play the

00:32:38.13 dick side of that are you kidding me it's awesome I I actually I made a

00:32:40.08 friend recently who is a PlayStation gamer and was like we could play games

00:35:49.05 a few decades ago private citizens used to be largely that private what's

00:35:54.08 changed the internet think about everything you've browsed search for

00:35:58.23 watched or tweeted now imagine all that data being crawled through collected and

00:36:04.09 aggregated by third parties into a permanent public record your record

00:36:09.12 having your private life exposed for others to see what was once something

00:36:14.19 only celebrities worried about but in an

00:36:17.18 era where everyone is online everyone is a public figure to keep my data private

00:36:21.18 when I go online I turn to expressvpn did you know there are hundreds of data

00:36:26.07 brokers out there whose sole business is

00:36:28.15 to buy and sell your data the worst part is they don't have to tell you who

00:36:32.23 they're selling it to to get your consent one of these data points is your ip

00:36:37.13 address data harvesters use your ip to uniquely identify you and your location

00:36:43.07 but with expressvpn my connection gets rerouted through an

00:36:46.07 encrypted server and my ip address is masked look at that what a great feature

00:36:50.14 masking I love when a thing is masked keeps me private every time I turn

00:36:54.19 expressvpn on I'm given a random ip address shared by other expressvpn

00:36:59.10 customers that makes it more difficult for third parties to identify me and

00:37:03.20 harvest my data and the best part is how easy expressvpn

00:37:07.15 is to use no matter what device you're on phone laptop or smart tv all you have

00:37:13.12 to do is tap one button to get protected

00:37:15.06 so if like me you believe that your data is your business secure yourself with

00:37:20.10 the number one rated vpn on the market visit expressvpn.com

00:37:25.22 face and get three extra months for free that is expressvpn.comsvpn.com

00:37:34.20 face go to expressvpn.com to learn more well you're not the only one who has

00:37:41.20 taken a fall recently Geoff oh my god I fell and it was I'm sorry we have a

00:37:50.13 uh no we're good everything is fine it's the photo I I also have a photo or two

00:37:57.01 I'd like to share so please as stated previously my chair had been broken for

00:38:02.13 months and I had continued to use it out of the hope that it would completely

00:38:07.12 collapse while we were recording at one point it finally it hit its last

00:38:11.11 legs last night it got to the point where the front part of it was

00:38:15.06 constantly tilted forward it was so uncomfortable to sit in but I was just

00:38:20.13 holding out I was hoping and uh last night I dropped something off my desk

00:38:25.05 and I went to pick it up and it snapped again on the forward angle and I tried

00:38:30.00 to recover by going middle you know like

00:38:31.18 tony hawk games when you're grinding and you have the balance meter that you're

00:38:36.23 trying to do it was as soon as I got back to the middle it immediately shot

00:38:43.07 left and it dumped me so hard I hit the ground so hard it is the most broken

00:38:47.13 chair it looks like an amusement park ride I'm gonna put a photo on the

00:38:51.14 discord right now at the chair this is the natural position of the chair

00:38:56.06 for this part it looks like a chair trying to

00:38:59.19 impersonate somebody on like a Disney ride with their hands up like it's going

00:39:05.11 sideways around the turn with the thing I ate [ __ ]

00:39:08.08 and I was so disappointed that it was not on the show I had been hoping so

00:39:12.14 this was after you talked about it breaking last time this has happened yes

00:39:16.08 this was that was after it was broken but I was still making it work and now I

00:39:20.03 had to go buy a new chair because that's why did it dump you off it dumped me

00:39:24.06 yesterday okay what time last night that would have been a great if you and Geoff

00:39:28.16 hit the ground at the same time did it dump you at like 7 p.m or to dump

00:39:33.02 you at like three in the morning oh it dumped me at like 7 p.m it was it wasn't

00:39:38.08 like early early yeah was it loud enough

00:39:41.07 to alert neighbors oh it was so loud I'm sure they were alerted yeah for sure it

00:39:46.02 was it was louder than I think the sushi fall the impact was was huge how long

00:39:50.12 did you have to lay on the ground before you decided you could move

00:39:55.07 I laid on the ground for like two seconds in shock and then I laughed

00:39:58.15 really hard for about five seconds and then I just laid there for probably

00:40:02.15 another minute processing how broken the chair was

00:40:06.12 it's fantastic I'm really excited that we missed all the furniture in your room

00:40:12.03 just jumping like half an inch

00:40:16.10 so that was my my night that's a new addition to uh people if they want to

00:40:21.11 update the drawing of your room [Laughter]

00:40:25.03 I also I feel like I should wrap up the end cap thing because we're doing that

00:40:29.21 yeah yeah please please please did we determine whether they were actually end

00:40:33.06 caps so that's I've got a whole lot to go through so I completed the challenge

00:40:37.10 and it was really boring and I feel bad about that I wish it was more exciting I

00:40:42.02 just ended up eating chicken and like pasta for a week it wasn't it was dull I

00:40:46.06 got incredibly lucky but the the real point of contention

00:40:50.03 because I was sick I couldn't go get it myself was did my mom understand what

00:40:54.08 end caps were based off the photos there's a lot of disagreement I felt

00:40:58.07 confident but as we stated I have salad cream in my dna you never know

00:41:02.20 can't be confident so I went grocery shopping yesterday

00:41:07.03 to review the end cap situation I'm gonna take I'm gonna take should I

00:41:12.06 post the ones that were up for dispute last time as a refresher yeah yeah okay

00:41:17.19 so these these were the two there are three of them but these are

00:41:21.12 the two I haven't I need to find because when I went back I realized how lucky I

00:41:25.12 was when I went the first time there were chickens in the end caps and that was

00:41:30.14 mainly what I went off of when I went yesterday everything was

00:41:34.20 different in the end caps and it I don't

00:41:37.03 think I would have been able to do it if I started this week wow so those were

00:41:40.12 some of the encaps that you guys didn't think were in caps here is

00:41:44.15 an alternate view of said end caps as you can see

00:41:49.02 very clearly end caps oh my edges of their row uh now the last one wow

00:41:54.23 that was the wider than the aisle they're very wide they're huge you have

00:42:00.09 end caps that are literally wider than the aisles it's like this grocery store

00:42:05.04 was tailor-made for this challenge they've almost made an aisle that runs

00:42:09.20 the other way down the store because they're so well seen anything like this

00:42:13.13 in my life yeah they're [ __ I massive and the other one that was up for

00:42:17.12 debate was this which looks horrendous like I agree that's gross since they

00:42:21.06 moved everything I couldn't find that specific one I remember there's a snake

00:42:24.23 next time I go in there I'll verify this

00:42:27.09 thing I'll fight it because of the state but I feel confident in saying that I I

00:42:31.16 stuck with the rules those are clearly in caps yeah I did it I just got super

00:42:36.17 lucky with the chicken I'm really sorry I doubted your mom

00:42:41.20 uh she clearly uh shopped for you uh in these giant a guinness world record

00:42:47.03 beating in caps um I have never been in a store in my life more suitable

00:42:52.00 for this channel perfect as I'm seeing here I don't think it's possible in an

00:42:57.02 heb and in a Texas super supermarket I don't think I don't think there's any

00:43:00.19 yeah I that's like three in caps put together just that the one with the milk

00:43:04.15 yeah and they're definitely narrow ones but those are like I get the confusion

00:43:08.19 it's also everything you need like it really is everything you need there's

00:43:14.10 milk yes eggs there's eggs there's [ __ ] chicken there's coffee stuff

00:43:18.06 like that's a whole week's worth of food yeah I I got super like mac and cheese

00:43:22.11 cheese I wish it was harder because it's not it wasn't funny which was the goal

00:43:26.16 of it I was like disappointed it's the first challenge I've done where I was

00:43:30.04 disappointed in doing it it was kind of reminiscent of doing the chicken dinner

00:43:33.07 challenge with pubg it was just a lot of chicken that was bland because I

00:43:37.00 couldn't okay on it okay you have to live for a week but you can only shop at

00:43:42.15 in caps in a 7-eleven oh god the sandwiches just 7-eleven sandwiches

00:43:47.16 it's like snickers and [ __ ] like sour heads and [ __ ] like that I also

00:43:53.01 need to say that last night sometimes but the night before we record these

00:43:58.09 I'll go through our discord chat and uh I'll just kind of think about what we

00:44:02.17 last talked about and look at the images

00:44:06.02 I looked at the drawing I did of the end

00:44:09.07 caps last night and just went holy [ __ ]

00:44:09.07 was that bad that that was what a [ __ ]

00:44:12.10 drawing having some time away from that looking

00:44:16.12 at it I think I I delivered the message of it but wow did that mean you had

00:44:21.07 covert though I did I was sick I was out of it I was definitely not in the best

00:44:26.11 place but yeah it was funny looking at it last night going holy [ __ ] I did not

00:44:32.04 realize how ugly this is this is terrible

00:44:35.06 that's the end caps well speaking of the chat I've got an update of my own um

00:44:39.08 based on what was in there last week I also have it I'd love to hear yours

00:44:44.15 let me just give it a little paste I hope it's not too powerful

00:44:47.23 I love this is like the show and tell episode this it is yeah it's a good

00:44:51.16 recap I'm interested to see if Gavin and I both have an update on the same thing

00:44:55.22 because I also there's another thing that was very contentious in the past that

00:45:01.01 oh no put the puzzle back together it looks like a hockey player's teeth

00:45:05.16 like the front of their teeth

00:45:10.12 except there's one too many teeth uh that's [ __ ] flawless dude uh can I

00:45:16.02 just say I was thinking about this I was

00:45:18.20 thinking about this after I was like man

00:45:21.03 I was genuinely offering to help him and he really doesn't seem to want my help

00:45:22.13 with this I guess he's got it or he either he doesn't want to hang out or

00:45:26.21 he's just like [ __ ] you I don't think you'll do a good job pretty confident I

00:45:31.01 would have done a better job and I don't know where that missing bit

00:45:34.21 is yeah you've attached all the pieces back to the wall yeah and you're missing

00:45:39.22 a chunk either the guy took it for reference or

00:45:43.11 it's fallen inside oh gavin's got hot I've got a hockey ball that's the

00:45:47.12 funniest [ __ ] thing did you was it like when you do a puzzle and you

00:45:51.18 realize there's one piece missing at the end like how far into this process it

00:45:56.00 was very confusing it was really throwing me for a while I could not

00:45:59.11 figure out that middle section

00:46:02.17 so what's your plan now are you just gonna cut more of the wall or how what

00:46:08.07 is the repair strategy uh could go for tape yeah yeah

00:46:13.03 maybe you should just put like the no scrumping sign over that hole just

00:46:17.07 pretend it doesn't exist if you wanted to get professionally

00:46:20.22 fixed I got there's dudes in my house right now that do this for a living more

00:46:25.11 than happy to share the information with the tattoo dudes

00:46:29.01 we'll figure something out I genuinely forgot about the wall what a shitty job

00:46:33.22 that person did that's unbelievable and then whoever did the follow-up

00:46:38.18 patchwork if you would have told me that was their

00:46:42.04 fix to it Gavin I would have believed it that seems equal

00:46:47.03 they did just that feels like it's the same energy it's the same exact energy

00:46:52.18 well I had another point of contention I guess to just wrap up the last of the

00:46:58.04 wrap-up at least from my end we got into a real there's a real

00:47:02.04 argument between extra medium we had recently yeah

00:47:05.16 yeah does it exist where is it on the scale

00:47:07.19 I mean Geoff has the clothing line but I don't feel like any of us are true

00:47:12.23 experts in the fashion industry so I took it upon myself to see if we could get

00:47:18.17 a ruling from maybe a more established company or brand so I reached out to

00:47:23.20 essentially every large fashion fashion brand I could from supreme to to Gucci

00:47:29.12 uh Prada Nike Reebok indeed all of them I reached

00:47:33.17 out to all of them I sent out over 10

00:47:35.18 emails some of them I even attached your

00:47:38.17 drawing Gavin and I will say that I got a zero percent response rate on ones in

00:47:44.05 which I attached your diagram of your size chart but I did receive two replies

00:47:50.10 two different companies I will post in the chat right now and then I will

00:47:56.04 read the responses and who they are from our first reply comes from Ralph Lauren

00:48:01.07 dear Andrew thank you for contacting Ralph Lauren.com customer

00:48:06.13 we apologize however because extra medium is not a size we offer we are

00:48:11.07 unable to advise how it would fit if you need further assistance please don't

00:48:16.23 hesitate to contact us sincerely Kimberly do they think you were like

00:48:21.02 specifically asking about their products uh they all kind of they nobody wanted

00:48:25.12 to take ownership of their responses they were like hypothetically if we did

00:48:28.17 that no one wanted to do a general ruling Kimberly is not having your [ __ ]

00:48:33.23 but she is required as by her job [Laughter]

00:48:36.23 which is nice because most didn't but we didn't get a response from Kimberly

00:48:42.03 and the next response I think is is very fascinating and if anything it maybe

00:48:46.20 helps your argument Gavin is from lacoste oh he replied I gotta zoom in on

00:48:52.06 this cuz small good afternoon Andrew thank you for contacting the cost our

00:48:57.01 size medium does sometimes come in slightly bigger and smaller sizes s

00:49:01.17 m m m I so they do have variations of medium on the item style such as our and

00:49:06.23 this is the most insane product description I've ever heard men's

00:49:12.00 heritage graphic color block zippered water resistant jacket that's one thing

00:49:15.23 as some of our jackets run larger than usual we hope this information is useful

00:49:20.08 to you thank you for shopping at lacoste whether you're shopping online or

00:49:23.17 stopping by one of our boutiques we look forward to seeing you soon kind records

00:49:27.23 Jennifer with a y so there's range within the medium ah there is apparently

00:49:31.20 range within the medium which makes your drawing I feel like somewhat valid of

00:49:36.04 the three different areas within medium well I think so and and last week in the

00:49:40.21 merch uh thread was it maxie that was on my side about it yeah somebody somebody

00:49:45.16 was on your side all right let me look at the merch chat

00:49:50.19 uh michael's getting really really annoyed

00:49:54.13 in this slack chat uh because I said if you were designed shirts

00:49:59.01 medium-sized determined Eric what was your thought on how that slack chat went

00:50:04.12 I didn't like it I like what maxi wrote maxi where extra medium is

00:50:10.16 medium x medium extra sludge and then tony pointed out that there is a company

00:50:16.19 called marine layer who actually has a size

00:50:19.22 with a name that sits in between medium and large which is

00:50:24.09 where you your head was going Eric and they call it marge marge I I don't like

00:50:30.06 march I'm not a fan not at all that is a bad that's a bad that's a bad thing I

00:50:35.08 will say that I feel like we didn't get any rulings from people

00:50:43.07 in the merch team maxie is on the social team and is therefore disqualified

00:50:50.08 from any kind of ruling there 100

00:50:53.05 I do you like my uh t-shirt by the way your t-shirt do you like the shirt I'm

00:50:58.01 wearing in this picture this is me right now

00:51:01.16 that's a nice extra medium fit I don't know mine why are you asking.

00:51:18.13 I wanted to see what it felt like to wear a shirt between what I asked for

00:51:23.02 and what you gave me and to me that is marge uh-huh and how did he how did he

00:51:28.12 feel yeah a little bit big could have done with extra media really I uh

00:51:33.01 I [ __ ] I I hey I was hoping this wouldn't come up again

00:51:37.16 and this is this is gonna sound listen I swear I'm not influenced by the

00:51:43.11 ps5 in any way but I was thinking about this in bed

00:51:47.12 over the weekend and uh I [ __ ]

00:51:50.19 changed my mind yeah I did I did and here's why [ __ ] this is why

00:51:57.09 here's why no I'm not happy about it I'm gonna buy you an Xbox series x and get

00:52:03.05 you back on my nose no seriously it has nothing to do with

00:52:06.11 the PlayStation I had already changed my mind and here's why I [ __ ] I hate it

00:52:10.05 I don't like it I don't like to agree with him I was much happier on your side

00:52:14.04 Eric but it was way more comfortable and feels smarter to be on your side than

00:52:19.03 his I trust me uh but I started thinking about extra small

00:52:24.04 and how the extra modifies small and the definition of small is time

00:52:29.20 so it should be extra tiny extra and and and I'm not

00:52:33.13 and on the other end large does the converse thing like the name large

00:52:37.07 connotates big and to make it extra extra large makes it bigger than the

00:52:40.21 normal large and then the definition of medium is like in the middle so the only

00:52:46.00 way for something to be extra not right it would be extra in the middle no I I

00:52:50.23 hate I hate that I agree no you're wrong

00:52:58.02 no it doesn't I hate it but it's not excellent that medium is a different

00:53:03.09 medium so it would have to not be true medium which would be medium it has to

00:53:09.07 be something else by virtue of the name nick said Geoff is sway but that was my

00:53:15.09 argument no no that's yes it was so I think you're just a revolutionary

00:53:19.04 Gavin because that is I just don't think

00:53:20.21 you made last week arguments well oh I'm terrible at expressing it

00:53:24.22 it was very good because I it's so funny you say that Geoff I had the same exact

00:53:29.09 experience with the same exact thought process or I wasn't happy about it but I

00:53:33.09 had to concede to myself that what Gavin is saying to an extent I think actually

00:53:38.08 does make sense and we're still too far ahead on recordings to see what the

00:53:41.11 audience thinks because the uh the big discussion hasn't really come out yet

00:53:44.13 but I'm excited even what you just said Gavin came in my

00:53:48.05 head of like I know you made this argument at the time but it was just so

00:53:52.12 shocking and seeing your diagram it was just I don't think it really landed I

00:53:57.12 needed time to process okay I'd really consider a word to def like no it can't

00:54:02.21 you're you guys are saying that medium is now something else

00:54:07.16 you're so if I were to get a medium shirt it wouldn't be extra medium which

00:54:12.21 is the most medium I mean according to the cost there's

00:54:16.13 like sometimes maybe three different variants of yours

00:54:20.04 but that's not extra medium Gavin who's saying that extra medium is the most

00:54:25.09 medium well I'm saying that their middle size

00:54:29.02 medium would be the extra medium there's not oh my god their middle sized medium

00:54:35.08 is medium but you're putting but so medium and extra medium are the same

00:54:40.08 look if we can no I think uh extra medium would be more

00:54:43.09 medium than medium yeah like there's a range of means no longer than this like

00:54:47.16 it's like a red it's like a little range and then extra medium is more dialed in

00:54:53.05 no isn't there a range though of of small to like there's large could it has

00:54:57.05 a large factor right like there's different variations of what large could

00:55:00.09 be why can there be a range of where medium is because actually

00:55:04.06 and if extra medium is a thing it's bigger than medium yeah I think like

00:55:08.07 nick's got it he says mediums rarely perfectly between small and large I

00:55:11.18 think that there's there's a range so an

00:55:14.15 extra medium would be like would be like pinpointed laser focused like

00:55:18.11 scientifically the most medium a medium could be I'll be honest I didn't see it

00:55:22.05 going that way for you Eric no I don't think it ever goes

00:55:25.21 because I'm right and everyone else is wrong so I also didn't see it going this

00:55:30.15 way I I'm sorry Eric I really would rather

00:55:34.08 be on your side I just I can't deny the fact that

00:55:36.21 he gets into your brain and then it just [ __ ]

00:55:39.15 Miriam webster's dictionary medium something that is in the middle position

00:55:45.03 as in size so what you're saying is that extra medium is the most medium so

00:55:49.17 medium is no longer the middle no no it's the middle

00:55:53.08 the middle of the middle but what you did Eric you gave me a lodge [Laughter]

00:55:59.18 which is

00:56:03.18 when asked for extra medium something that doesn't [ __ ] exist I

00:56:08.19 automatically go to large yeah all of this could have been avoided

00:56:13.18 Gavin if you just would have asked for a march it sounds like a margin

00:56:20.04 it sounds like a marge is too much medium it's a little bit too big

00:56:28.06 speaking of which if you want to see Gavin in his extra medium you can watch

00:56:33.13 the first episode of does it do premiering on the rooster teeth and the

00:56:39.04 face YouTube channel on September 2nd

00:56:47.03 this is how the first episode will be out but the second episode will be

00:56:52.17 coming out right afterward I think the 8th or 9th uh so we'll have the first

00:56:57.15 two episodes of our pilot and then uh we'll get back in the studio and do a

00:57:02.17 lot more I think we I think we walked out of that recording going oh we can do

00:57:06.23 like two seasons of the show in a day we definitely did I will say uh I've

00:57:12.13 watched the first episode about 20 times now and I

00:57:15.07 I think it's a good episode I think the edit that we've got good at edits I

00:57:18.13 think episode two is going to be way better I just I just want to say I'm

00:57:22.02 clearly the worst part of episode one I will get better audiences

00:57:28.19 very very mediocre episode two I'm really looking forward

00:57:33.03 to there's a teaser trailer at the end of one that I'm really jazzed about oh

00:57:37.22 yeah I mean good no

00:57:41.20 all right [ __ ] both of you uh when do we get to record again

00:57:46.12 yeah that's a great question Gavin when when are you available again uh I'm

00:57:51.09 available today uh okay so that doesn't [ __ ] help so when are you available

00:57:57.03 again I'm available it's like 4pm I'm available today all right get the boys

00:58:03.18 together tell them they're staying at work late tonight gavin's

00:58:07.22 ready no I'm also available next week if you want to do two yes what

00:58:13.00 you're available next week oh boy okay let me see if I can oh man I don't have

00:58:16.17 anything ordered like I don't okay I could try yeah [ __ ] all right

00:58:22.00 oh my god Eric Eric did not know how to handle no Gavin 100

00:58:28.00 oh because I thought it was two weeks out at least oh I got it I thought we

00:58:32.13 were going post labor day I really did not think it was gonna be like yeah next

00:58:37.16 week had no idea that might be a double first I've never seen I've never seen

00:58:43.05 Eric like stymied for a response to not know how to handle it and I've

00:58:46.13 never I've never seen Gavin come out of the gate and be like yeah I always think

00:58:51.11 you didn't want me to be available next time no I I I sound like you were avail

00:58:55.11 I thought you were unavailable next week and then we would be back at some time

00:59:00.06 after labor day uh I mean uh next week is I mean we

00:59:03.21 could do it then I mean hang on hang on I don't like this answer what were you

00:59:08.21 gonna say when you were going to put caveats on it well I'll be honest my

00:59:14.22 my arse and leg still hurts from what I fell over last time I'd say

00:59:20.02 I'd say the left of my pelvis is at like 70 still

00:59:24.23 and I spent the last week at maybe like 50.

00:59:28.12 I uh next week I'm open it's up uh if you want to go after labor day

00:59:33.09 I'll probably be 100

00:59:35.13 I mean we have our first not for long you won't

00:59:39.20 we have our first office day next week oh yeah we do yeah

00:59:43.16 that's exciting yeah uh I I gotta say I forgot how much and how hard you ate

00:59:50.00 [ __ ] in that recording session until I started watching that

00:59:54.12 the one the one that hurt was in episode

00:59:56.17 two and I I must have trapped a nerve or

00:59:58.23 something because I went every night and

01:00:01.01 the reason I'm like forgetting [ __ ] all over the place

01:00:04.19 I ain't been sleeping good since that fall my leg

01:00:08.04 I can't lie on one side because it crushes my leg bone into my pelvis which

01:00:12.11 hurts and if I go on the other side my leg falls asleep and starts tingling at

01:00:17.05 like 3am and uh I was about to go to the doctor

01:00:19.17 but it's actually stopped doing that I I

01:00:21.14 think I trapped a nervous so I I smashed something I hit hard you did that's

01:00:26.17 terrible and I've been having [ __ ] sleep

01:00:30.04 oh man I the funny thing about it too is that at no point in any of those

01:00:35.18 episodes did you need to eat [ __ ]

01:00:38.04 no that's the whole point it was not completely pointless

01:00:43.01 you kicked the [ __ ] tv with your foot six feet in the air I was so surprised I

01:00:49.14 had forgotten that happened I was so caught off guard in the episode when it

01:00:53.18 happened I was it was like one of I think the third night I was up at three

01:00:57.07 because I had to stand up and sort of get the blood back into my leg and I was

01:01:00.15 thinking all these different things like oh you

01:01:02.15 know I've wrecked my leg permanently I've trapped a nerve I've got a blood

01:01:06.07 clot I'm gonna die I I was just like I just need to settle down and stop

01:01:10.22 jumping all around I'm in my mid-30s I've gotta pack it in and then the the

01:01:15.16 pain eventually went away and I was like oh I'm excited for the next one

01:01:20.02 I didn't learn anything dude I've been having that conversation I've been

01:01:23.18 having that conversation with myself for 17 years it's pointless

01:01:28.00 and here we here I am taking pictures of my bruises to send you today it's like

01:01:33.05 you're gonna it's just who you are bud [Laughter]

01:01:35.16 well let's try to film it next week if we can uh failing that are you available

01:01:40.00 the following week uh well I think you're not are you I think I'm well

01:01:43.22 anyway we don't need to turn this into a whole uh supplemental uh scheduling

01:01:47.07 episode uh as a matter of fact we should probably wrap up we wrapped up a lot

01:01:51.20 today I feel like we did a lot of tied up a lot of loose ends it was everybody

01:01:58.00 got to share some photos uh I was I'll be honest I had forgotten about the

01:02:01.12 hockey teeth thing and it was great it was really great to see the

01:02:05.10 resolution of that and I hope you don't change it I hope that that's

01:02:10.00 it is so incongruous with the rest of your house I love it it's [ __ ]

01:02:14.21 awesome and Andrew I'm glad you're feeling

01:02:18.15 better and uh we should probably also mention

01:02:22.01 uh we did not record the monkey movie I recognized that we were very excited we

01:02:25.21 were talking about it we were gonna do it it was a big thing uh I think we

01:02:29.18 talked about it a lot in the episode and then I just don't want the audience to

01:02:33.09 be like where the [ __ ] why aren't they talking about it where that we had

01:02:36.12 unfortunate scheduling conflicts that came up and so we are still gonna record

01:02:40.00 this goddamn monkey movie this is not a bit where we never do the thing we

01:02:44.04 really will we really will record in vp2
