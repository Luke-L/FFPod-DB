00:00:00.02 [Music]

00:00:07.22 [Music]

00:00:15.12 My favorite book that I've oh [ __ ] we've

00:00:18.18 already started 92 days what a weird I'm almost thrown off why is andre's

00:00:22.15 throwing off he he was trying to do a book club or something and then said I

00:00:27.01 stopped in the middle of it because nobody showed up typically Eric will

00:00:30.16 show up 10 minutes before and ever nick showed up like four minutes before so I

00:00:36.02 feel like I'm still in pleasantries that you're not expected to be once

00:00:38.15 we're only four minutes of pleasantries and we're making that's gonna destroy

00:00:42.13 you I I'm four minutes off this whole show

00:00:45.20 yeah he's gonna we'll have to we'll have to let it roll for another four minutes

00:00:51.05 at the end just so you can finish up uh no Eric today as a matter of fact uh he

00:00:55.10 let us know ahead of time he's uh gotta do dual duty on some other podcast or

00:00:59.18 some [ __ ] bit weird that we still do it at the same time as the other podcast

00:01:04.19 yeah well I believe that was at your insistence right you said you never

00:01:07.23 wanted to do that other podcast again and you had so you would only do this

00:01:11.03 one if we scheduled it during the exact same time that's exactly what I said

00:01:15.22 that is true I remember hello hello hello hello and

00:01:20.05 welcome to another episode of the F**kFuckFacePodcast I believe

00:01:24.13 I believe I don't have Eric here this week oh no never mind nick got it to me

00:01:30.15 uh this is episode 108

00:01:33.01 this is season four Andrew what year is this uh 2022 or three thank you Gavin

00:01:39.05 you nailed it volume one the 108th episode my name is Geoff Ramsey with me

00:01:45.09 as always uh Andrew patton and Gavin free and uh I hope you guys are doing well

00:01:50.11 today uh boy do I we got a few things to talk about I I haven't spoken to you

00:01:56.00 guys in a week I'd love to catch up and yeah let me tell you I uh right out of

00:02:00.13 the way I just want to get this over with right out of the way

00:02:05.12 you know I don't listen to our podcast I try not I try not to hear me uh ever

00:02:11.11 if I can avoid it uh I get on my nerves so [ __ ] quick it's unbelievable

00:02:17.05 this is such a wild thing to say is somebody who is on three podcasts

00:02:21.17 currently yeah somebody who hates podcasts you're on you cannot stop

00:02:26.08 making them so here's the thing I I gotta make a living right daddy daddy's

00:02:30.23 got it that's fair keep the lights on but uh uh also um

00:02:34.17 I think we've established at this point that the three podcasts I'm on are my

00:02:39.02 only forms of social interaction so it's just how I maintain my relationships

00:02:43.11 with people that are important to me and uh

00:02:45.08 imagine if you just like recorded every conversation you had with your mom and

00:02:48.22 then like a week later you listen to the conversation you guys had after dinner

00:02:52.15 on a Wednesday night you'd be like I sound like a [ __ ] idiot coming next

00:02:56.09 month on roosterteeth.com

00:02:58.19 wait my mom and I are not I love my mom daily we are not doing a podcast

00:03:03.12 together that is a that is a no what we call a non-starter anyway so I uh I was

00:03:09.10 I listened to the podcast the other day and it was episode 106.

00:03:13.19 And uh I don't know why I was just in a really good mood and I thought let's

00:03:18.09 ruin that uh let's listen to yourself and I found it to be so charming and I

00:03:22.23 enjoyed it so much there was a little conversation we had about getting homes

00:03:27.16 buying homes and then getting a home inspected and then Andrew had this idea

00:03:31.21 for a vibe inspector to come and check out your home and make sure the vibe fit

00:03:35.13 which I thought was so [ __ ] funny I laughed about it all day long it just

00:03:38.17 kept popping up in my head and I just kept laughing about it I asked if we

00:03:42.12 could get like a vibe inspector a shirt made which I really sounds kind of

00:03:45.16 creepy actually another thing about it yeah it's very close to those like

00:03:49.03 female body inspectors right right you don't want that right but you know I

00:03:53.18 was thinking in the terms of like checking out a house yeah

00:03:56.21 as it was framed in our episode anyway so I go through the episode and

00:03:59.23 I'm actually I'm actually thinking to myself I should listen to this more

00:04:04.15 often this isn't that bad and then I stepped in and I brought up

00:04:10.14 then I brought up the idea I had for us and and in one second illustrated why I

00:04:16.21 am the dumbest stupidest most idiotic most useless person on earth

00:04:25.14 in the year of 2022. I present the idea to you guys that we should everybody

00:04:30.17 should pick they're the thing that they think they're the best in the world at

00:04:34.22 right yeah I have a nice clip for this movie yeah you don't need it

00:04:39.07 you don't need it because I'm covering it but it'll help

00:04:42.08 I then proceed to give you guys the two things that I think I'm the best in the

00:04:46.22 world at as examples and also tell you there's no way I'm the best in the world

00:04:51.10 at this this is utter [ __ ] and then a week later and I I was coming off the

00:04:55.21 episode so I remembered it was fresh in my head 107 we then have to present our

00:04:59.18 homework clearly I forgot clearly even after Andrew reminded me I didn't do it

00:05:04.04 I forgot so I just did said the first two things that popped in my head which

00:05:08.01 were my examples that were lies that I admitted were lies to the audience the

00:05:12.12 week before completely earnestly like suddenly suddenly I had best in the

00:05:16.17 world confidence where it didn't exist the week before is the only answer I can

00:05:20.18 give you but holy [ __ ] that's it I can't ever listen to the podcast again or I

00:05:24.20 will I'll never be able to open my mouth

00:05:27.11 I'll never be able to move out because I

00:05:29.05 am a walking stupid contradiction we did some of the best and on my part

00:05:34.06 unintentional gas lighting I've ever seen

00:05:36.18 it was so immensely impressive basically what what we came up with was that Geoff

00:05:41.14 has signed a piece of homework and I added on to it and then the

00:05:45.22 next time we talk about it I'm reading the homework that I helped Geoff assign

00:05:50.05 as if I'm reading it for the first time it was and Andrew is the only sane one

00:05:54.12 in the whole thing I've probably had a clip would you like to hear it please I

00:05:58.09 was yes I was infuriated last week because you guys were throwing me under

00:06:03.12 the bus for the thing I had no pardon I was just trying to help you two

00:06:07.08 this is a a little clip from from 107

00:06:10.15 followed by a little dreamy sound effect and then immediately

00:06:13.17 following the week before here we go we had homework the last show yeah

00:06:17.17 what's your homework what was your homework Andrew do it my

00:06:20.19 homework uh well the homework you assigned for all of us was that we had

00:06:24.18 to come up with what we were the best in the world at and what we thought the

00:06:28.12 other members of this podcast might be the best in the world at I don't really

00:06:32.00 understand the homework podcast homework reminder that we said we would think

00:06:36.07 about what we are best in the world at and what we think others would be best

00:06:41.01 at but you mentioned on this podcast I did I don't even remember signing the

00:06:46.10 homework so I don't really give a [ __ ]

00:06:53.22 homework for all of us this is what we'll do and we'll talk about it on the

00:06:59.03 next thing and then yeah the way you just said that it sounds

00:07:02.07 like something you would say you're the worst you're both the worst

00:07:06.13 we should all think about what we're the best in the world at maybe we should

00:07:09.20 maybe that's an angle we should take with the podcast so should we come up

00:07:12.19 with our own things that we think we're best at or should we come up with us

00:07:14.06 plus the other

00:07:24.04 where as soon as I press stop on this podcast I can't remember anything we

00:07:29.13 talked about I am I'm pretty well versed in face like I've listened to everyone

00:07:33.14 I've proved everyone I know everything that's happened while I'm recording

00:07:37.21 something and everything except the previous week there's just this weird

00:07:41.16 void where I have no idea what was said because I haven't proved it yet it's so

00:07:45.05 bizarre I've I was reading it as though I'd never heard that in my life and I

00:07:48.23 said it

00:07:51.14 said the same thing with the pencil that's me with the pencil I genuinely

00:07:55.22 forgot I ever said that it wasn't it started anything why do we why do our is

00:08:00.10 do you think it's protection do you think our brains are trying to protect

00:08:04.06 us by immediately like flushing the brain toilet the

00:08:07.16 second we hit stop on an episode if I haven't proofed the previous one at the

00:08:12.10 time of a recording it doesn't exist to me and I can't explain why totally agree

00:08:17.08 can I talk about why I'm an idiot in relation to this so I have a whole other

00:08:22.04 layer of why I'm the dumbest person in the world

00:08:25.07 Gavin in the face slack yesterday said hey when is the preview out for the

00:08:30.00 episode that will come out this upcoming week which they've heard by now but you

00:08:33.20 wanted the preview because you said you needed to grab something from it because

00:08:39.20 historically it's always been weaponized against me there's only one other time

00:08:44.04 I could think of when it wasn't aimed at me and it was Geoff's [ __ ] up an ad by

00:08:49.09 spelling the wrong word and I'm doing the ads

00:08:53.13 it can't be you spelling so I was like it's just me I guess I was like I was

00:08:58.02 convinced I texted Gavin last night so what are you gonna use against me and

00:09:03.05 his silence was deafening I was convinced

00:09:05.09 that he had something lined up for me he replied this morning I'm like oh I can

00:09:09.09 play that game too I ain't going to reply and I'm going to just say some

00:09:13.01 [ __ ] in our slack saying could you please pull audio from Geoff in this

00:09:17.00 random episode and Gavin in this one I had no audio pulled this is fake yeah

00:09:21.12 that was fake because I was paranoid that you guys had something so I was

00:09:25.08 trying to flip it I was trying to make you paranoid about what I might had but

00:09:30.13 it's the first time your [ __ ] audio is on my side it was like it's from me

00:09:35.12 yeah I guys happily use audio against you but I was

00:09:38.07 listening to that last week and I just thought I have to bury myself I have to

00:09:41.18 use this audio against me and Geoff because it is horrendous I appreciate it

00:09:45.17 because it was I I felt like a crazy person

00:09:48.11 last week when you guys were like ah there's some [ __ ] homework by you

00:09:51.22 you're throwing it all on me I didn't I didn't care if we did it it was just

00:09:56.19 trying to be supportive you said now that the funny thing there is I was

00:10:01.04 totally just [ __ ] with you like oh I do I remember to signing the homework

00:10:05.10 and all that at that point I just assumed Gavin was along for the gag I

00:10:10.12 just thought we were both in on the joke I'm just extremely unintelligent

00:10:15.11 so Gavin you're an idiot that way uh I'm a I have zero integrity and I'm just a

00:10:21.09 bald-faced liar and then Andrew you're back to Paris you're in a new paranoia

00:10:26.00 yeah which is scary because I do not I'll be honest guys I do not want to go

00:10:30.13 back into the a new age of paranoia it was too much

00:10:34.17 oh but that feels like such a great subtitle for a season the new age of

00:10:40.08 paranoia season five I was really excited Andrew in the slack

00:10:44.06 world this is super short notice so if it's possible no if it's not possible no

00:10:49.01 worries but someone pulls something Gavin said in episode 98 I also need

00:10:53.12 something Geoff said in 101. I like the futures they're so vague like there's no

00:10:57.07 time codes and I'm just like yeah and now the yeah I'm slightly

00:11:00.15 disappointed that you got you got no audio weapon my hope was that maybe one

00:11:04.22 of you would listen to it and try to find the thing like that was my long

00:11:09.00 shot would be funny but I was just trying to create paranoia because I was

00:11:12.17 convinced what you had would be used against me in some capacity

00:11:16.12 what a waste I didn't need to do that I'm sorry nick god I immediately reached

00:11:20.10 out to nick it was like no I don't need anything I'm just being dumb

00:11:26.00 mind games I love that we have one bit that was

00:11:28.09 honestly not even a good bit a [ __ ]

00:11:31.20 like five minute bit that turned into three

00:11:35.09 separate instances of us being idiots [Laughter]

00:11:38.17 well I mean you never know where the good bits will be because I'm going to

00:11:44.06 be honest with you when you said when you said let's all make salads

00:11:48.01 internally I was like I don't know why we're doing this but I'll do it because

00:11:51.10 you want to I support this and we would salad cream I [ __ ] that up in a whole

00:11:57.09 or was that unrelated to the salad was that a side

00:12:00.00 how much salad content have we made was that adjacent was that salad cream

00:12:04.11 content that became salad content or was

00:12:06.12 that part of the make your salad content you're you're going way too far back in

00:12:11.11 the vault for me that's fair Gavin you pretend to remember stuff

00:12:16.08 which what what do you think [ __ ] says I was separate

00:12:19.21 what was that gab are you okay seven second there was silence like

00:12:24.18 you're waiting for nick's approval

00:12:28.13 that's very weird please keep that in nick that was a very strange line

00:12:33.18 Gavin dropped I thought you had a connection

00:12:36.20 issue it was pretty long wasn't it even nick it was one nick was scared.

00:12:45.04 [Music]

00:12:48.06 God is scared go ahead should you and I talk about how the

00:12:53.05 universe is scared that you and I will ever spend any time together they're

00:12:58.04 back at it it's not the weather this time though oh god

00:13:01.06 damn it had did I don't know if I don't know if we talked about it on the

00:13:06.13 podcast yet uh or in personal conversations Andrew but Gavin and I uh

00:13:10.09 and our our significant others his girlfriend meg and my girlfriend Emily

00:13:14.03 we had all decided we we've been talking for months and months and months about

00:13:17.20 going to las Vegas together and having like a weekend in Vegas together and we

00:13:21.21 finally [ __ ] scheduled it and so we were gonna like and it was for this

00:13:27.11 weekend right so um it was uh the way I had it scheduled or

00:13:31.09 I had it set up is because it's the nba finals Emily and I were going to get up

00:13:34.22 first thing Friday morning and we were going to fly to Boston and then Friday

00:13:39.00 night we were going to watch game four of the finals as my birthday present

00:13:43.20 from Emily we're gonna uh she was gonna get us

00:13:45.18 awesome seats and I would get to watch the celtics play in the finals which is

00:13:49.05 like a you know a dream come true for me and I've only got to do it once before

00:13:52.22 in my life uh and that was with jack so talk about an upgrade with Emily and uh

00:13:58.07 and then we were gonna go to bed and then get up first thing Saturday morning

00:14:01.12 and fly to las Vegas and meet Gavin and meg in las Vegas I was so excited for

00:14:05.14 this we were going to spend two days together we got hotels rooms in the same

00:14:09.16 place we were gonna do like I thought they came up with a clever idea we're

00:14:13.05 gonna do one thing they really wanna do one thing we wanna do so Emily got

00:14:17.01 tickets to see shin lim and go to a magic show so I could heckle and then uh

00:14:20.16 which is what I want to do and she likes magic and then Gavin and meg wanted to

00:14:24.16 go do uh some escape rooms so we were gonna go do that and it was just like it

00:14:29.20 was shaping up to be the perfect weekend and then last night

00:14:33.22 last night Emily tested positive for covid no

00:14:37.13 I couldn't believe it no because the universe was like

00:14:41.18 wait a minute who's gonna have fun with who

00:14:44.19 no [ __ ] you [ __ ] you that's what the universe said

00:14:48.20 I was literally like wow I'm actually looking forward to a trip for the first

00:14:52.16 time that you know there isn't a work trip or me going to see my family it's

00:14:55.20 like this is a real vacation trip I can't belie oh never mind yeah it's a I I I

00:15:02.00 know and Emily is heartbroken obviously and I feel terrible for her and she

00:15:06.01 feels so guilty for getting covered which is you know totally not her fault

00:15:09.16 because everybody seems to get it at some point or other but uh it's a it's

00:15:13.18 kind of luckily I was I was telling Emily I've the universe has uh been

00:15:18.04 aware of me for long enough that stuff getting canceled no longer affects me

00:15:21.07 it's like okay whatever I get it just you know so just me stepping in [ __ ] in

00:15:25.09 the backyard again no problem it's just a new version of that right

00:15:29.20 I'm supposed to be in the [ __ ] uh of course right and uh

00:15:33.11 so it's no big deal to me I'm just like yeah we'll get him next time champ

00:15:37.16 but uh she was pretty heartbroken about it and uh I hope that we can do it again

00:15:41.15 in the future but maybe we can't like plan a diversity or something like we

00:15:45.21 can't let on to the universe that we're trying to spend time together

00:15:49.15 not not to go too far back but the how you frame that just gave me a thought

00:15:53.14 that I've never had before you said you what did you you wanted to see a magic

00:15:57.11 show what was the other thing uh escape rooms

00:16:00.15 no that was gavin's thing you said tooth I thought you said two things

00:16:05.04 I want to heckle the magician oh I see so your thing was magicians

00:16:09.20 yeah the thing that Gavin and meg were excited about were traveling to a place

00:16:14.09 to get locked into a room that you have to try to leave from with you like the

00:16:18.16 premise of an escape like I know it's they're fun they're great but like the

00:16:23.09 idea of like having the first escape room and trying to convince somebody

00:16:26.20 that's fun feels like a real exercise because the premise is you go to a place

00:16:31.13 I'm gonna lock you in this room and you're not gonna be able to immediately

00:16:34.22 leave you're gonna have to try to solve clues to leave this space have fun

00:16:40.06 especially you're gonna pay me for this considering at least in my mind the

00:16:44.12 genesis of this whole escape room craze was from that movie the cube where

00:16:49.12 people just woke up and then they had to get out and every time they tried they

00:16:53.22 died like it's such a dark beginning uh I was looking forward to it though I

00:16:58.06 like escape rooms I think they're a blast oh they're great meg was really

00:17:02.07 looking forward to the magician and uh I had to because magic she loves it it

00:17:06.01 makes her cry for some reason she explained it but uh I had to warn her about

00:17:10.01 the fact that the experience of seeing a magician with Geoff is going to be a

00:17:15.05 completely different spirit with his how.

00:17:23.23 [Music]

00:17:29.07 On stage performers feed off of energy you want to give good energy you want

00:17:34.09 them to know you're entertained and amazed by what they're doing

00:17:39.01 I know you share a deep fandom for north MacDonald Geoff have you ever seen the

00:17:42.15 compilation of him when he was hosting the YouTube comedy festival with like

00:17:48.02 Sarah silver man was there I don't remember whose co-hosts were but they

00:17:51.12 had a magician come on as like one of the acts that guy is a Netflix I don't

00:17:56.17 remember his name now but he did this trick where like he put this giant this

00:18:01.21 giant glass into a box and it exploded was like the trick

00:18:06.00 and it cut one of the hosts it was a disaster and it explodes and nor

00:18:10.12 mcdonald's response was to say this guy's a [ __ ] sorcerer like he got so

00:18:15.05 nervous about it it's great that's what it sounds like

00:18:19.06 what your experience is it's so [ __ ]

00:18:21.11 funny you just hear me say this you got cut that's what happens

00:18:24.10 when you put a [ __ ] sorcerer on set what do expect here have we

00:18:28.23 it's great I'll send it to you I'll say I am halfway through with his his uh

00:18:34.02 posthumous uh special that's on Netflix right now and I had to turn it off

00:18:39.18 because it was making me cry was it sad yeah

00:18:41.23 it's just like it's just him like the night before I think a surgery and he

00:18:47.18 was like I gotta get all this out just in case you know and then he looks very

00:18:52.05 ill uh and he's very sweet and very funny and he's just going off the top of

00:18:56.07 his head and there's no audience or no crowd so it's a bit awkward at times but

00:19:01.11 more than anything you just like you just see in this

00:19:04.02 what appears to someone who didn't know him as a gentle brilliance and in just

00:19:08.17 such a fragile state uh it was just really really kind of heartbreaking and

00:19:12.10 it didn't kill him then did it he died much later than that yeah he died over

00:19:16.11 about a year after that yeah yeah wow I had I cuz I got to see him at the

00:19:20.21 theater in town and it's like one of the favorite my

00:19:23.14 favorite shows I've ever seen and I would constantly ever since that point I

00:19:27.13 probably saw that in like 2014 I would constantly look at their schedule and be

00:19:32.09 like oh is he going to come into town like this would be so exciting I love

00:19:35.22 he's one of my favorite comedians and I recently like a week ago

00:19:39.21 went on the website just to see what it is it's always all cover bands it's

00:19:43.11 terrible the booking is awful it's just cover bands but it's I had this weird

00:19:47.14 realization even though he's been dead for quite a while there was still part

00:19:50.20 of me that was like oh maybe I'll see him oh I can't like that'll never happen

00:19:55.03 again it was a weird processing of like he's gone

00:19:58.12 yeah you were lucky enough to see him with such a small window of over yeah in

00:20:02.22 your lives exactly and it's just it's a strange thing I don't know if I'll watch

00:20:06.21 that I've like a weird thing where if there's

00:20:10.00 uh an artist or like a creative type that I like I really struggle with

00:20:13.19 finishing their last work oh yeah like the idea of knowing that I have that

00:20:18.17 like whenever I want to is almost more impactful to me than if I saw it

00:20:22.14 I had the same with patrice O'Neill where I've like never seen his special

00:20:26.02 but I just thought his earlier work was so funny conversationally at least I

00:20:29.11 completely agree with you there are two series that I I that like touched me so

00:20:34.05 intensely in some way that I never finished them on purpose and that I mean

00:20:38.11 they're very they're silly but shit's creek I am halfway through the last

00:20:40.21 season of shit's quick and I just don't want to finish it because I don't want

00:20:44.12 it to be over and season three of ash vs evil dead

00:20:48.11 because I have been a fan of evil dead since I was a kid

00:20:52.13 and I grew up with it and it's so charming and so well done that I just

00:20:56.05 don't want to see it be over you know and so I just I don't know that I'll

00:20:59.07 ever watch them because I just like knowing that they're out there if I ever

00:21:03.18 want to you know I'd rather yeah I'd rather have that than than know what I'm

00:21:07.12 missing in some ways totally yeah absolutely I I can I can relate to that

00:21:12.09 even in like silly I think like the funniest one is I have a clip of um oh I

00:21:17.17 forget his last name but uh the celtics play by play guy mike what's his last

00:21:22.12 name Geoff mike mike gorman mike gorman yeah I've got like uh he did

00:21:26.01 like a immemorial thing to Tommy heinzen

00:21:27.22 that I just have never watched because I just I like having that because they

00:21:32.04 were such a an important iconic duo even though I I

00:21:35.20 didn't get to see too much of their coverage like they called games for I'd

00:21:39.12 assumed over 20 years felt like they did

00:21:41.18 it for like 70 years they felt like they were pillars of eternity for that team

00:21:46.12 um yeah that's it's it's interesting how

00:21:49.20 how those pieces of media can impact you Gavin what are we do do you share any

00:21:55.04 experiences like that where I don't want to watch someone's

00:21:59.06 end the final piece of their work sure you don't want to be over

00:22:02.16 I've never really looked at it from that point of view I feel like it's quite

00:22:06.04 interesting like I I would watch the norm thing but yeah it is sad but I feel

00:22:10.23 like comedy and tragedy they go so well together don't they totally for sure

00:22:15.06 absolutely it's interesting when norm passed like thinking about how much his

00:22:19.08 his comedy I think has impacted face like indirectly I think just through

00:22:24.21 what at least I find funny yeah oh yeah I went on an absolute YouTube binge

00:22:30.10 after he died of just all of his late night appearances and snl stuff and

00:22:35.18 he just never gave a singular [ __ ] at any point and it's so you gotta respect

00:22:40.01 it I don't think anyone has done it to that extent throughout and then kept an

00:22:44.02 entire career going uh one other person who's also dead now unfortunately and

00:22:48.15 that was Gilbert Godfrey yeah they both yeah uh just like

00:22:53.11 it is I mean they really are like the the prototype for for what face is right

00:22:58.21 it's like just two people that are so entertained by the thing that they're

00:23:03.07 doing that it doesn't matter if it's detrimental to them or their career in

00:23:07.17 any way they're going to go up there and do it Gilbert Godfrey is going to go up

00:23:11.16 there when he's on tour with the go-go's and they come to him and the producers

00:23:16.04 come to him and say listen this is a family-friendly show these are a bunch

00:23:19.12 of like 12-year-old girls watching that want to see the go-go's seeing vacation

00:23:24.12 uh and you can't get up there and say talk about anal and he's like okay got

00:23:28.22 it and goes worse you know because he ha he doesn't have a choice like there's

00:23:32.21 like a and then like it's like like he doesn't want to it's just that is now

00:23:36.22 the funniest choice like you have to do yeah it's like there's a there's like

00:23:41.03 some sort of a like uh invisible force pulling you

00:23:44.06 towards a a self-destructive joke yeah it's it's great to even just like

00:23:48.22 with norm especially for me like you constantly hear new stories and it's

00:23:52.09 like the content even though he's not producing new stuff you learn different

00:23:55.11 aspects I was listening to a thing recently and this person talked about

00:24:00.13 how when norm was starting in like Canada as a comedian he would bomb all

00:24:05.07 the time because his style was very specific and it didn't work in a lot of

00:24:08.19 rooms and if he bombed he would stay like if he did well he

00:24:12.21 would kind of just leave immediately but

00:24:14.14 if he bombed he'd stay in the green room

00:24:16.17 the entire night and then he'd go to the exit when everybody finished and he'd

00:24:20.17 make everybody shake his hand on the way out

00:24:28.08 he just he didn't give a [ __ ] if he did

00:24:31.00 well but if he did horribly just for the awkward exchange he would shake

00:24:36.02 everybody's hand so good he's a legend [Laughter]

00:24:41.11 I had to um register a new phone number recently yeah and I had a uh

00:24:47.09 it was like the first time I've ever been able to like pick a phone number

00:24:51.14 like you just like type in numbers and

00:24:54.10 see if it's available holy [ __ ] you guys yeah then I was like

00:24:57.14 oh I bet there's like websites for this and I found a website that just sells

00:25:01.03 numbers I assume they just like buy up all these vanity phone numbers and stuff

00:25:07.01 and uh I found one with a 778 area code which I think is bc

00:25:10.23 in Canada I think it's one of those ones and I found Andrew I found your

00:25:16.02 ultimate phone number she did what's the number I'll let me move my [ __ ]

00:25:21.22 seven seven eight pancake and it's two thousand dollars

00:25:25.22 I think it's too much I think we should get the the eric's credit card no we

00:25:31.01 need that I think that should be your phone number when will this air

00:25:36.08 what what what day will this come out can we talk about this thing the thing

00:25:39.22 that we bleep two weeks from now is that that should be fine the choice yeah

00:25:44.13 that's fine I found out recently that

00:25:49.03 that is essentially what it's predicted to go at 2000 I'd much rather

00:25:54.00 than 778 pancake as good as seven seven eight pancake is that's [ __ ] great

00:25:59.18 why not why not both so are you in the process of changing your phone number

00:26:04.04 and then not telling us no it's like a business line uh okay

00:26:08.08 oh seven seven day pancake would be so good if you're interested in high speed

00:26:14.02 photography call call the slow-mo guys it's 778 pancake I uh

00:26:18.16 I watched maybe you'll remember the name to this Geoff because it was like a big

00:26:22.12 90s movie Sandra bullock it's where there's like a hacker she's a computer

00:26:26.10 hacker the net I watched the net like a week ago and she goes on a website

00:26:30.19 called pizza.net and I've never wanted anything more to exist I was so

00:26:34.00 disappointed to put in pizza.net and have it just not exist how much is it

00:26:38.06 I have no idea I don't even think it's for sale it's just like this domain

00:26:41.06 doesn't exist she orders the pizza from pizza.net and it just comes to her it's

00:26:46.13 great that's the one with like mozart's ghost or whatever right yeah it is it's

00:26:50.15 it's ghost yeah she like gets her thing hacked she's a hacker and she she I

00:26:56.04 don't know it's a dumb movie it's 90s internet cringe and the best one so we

00:27:00.11 we agree we're gonna get right like this already we have to and

00:27:04.17 that's why I'm so mad that Eric is here because I independently

00:27:07.17 made an account on that website and I just got an email from them saying like

00:27:12.02 yeah you need to send in a proof of address

00:27:15.09 uh with an id like you need to properly register and it took like six days for

00:27:20.16 that process uh it's actually um it's like Andrew and I have had an idea about

00:27:26.19 a thing we want to do someday and it's pretty important to that idea so I feel

00:27:33.07 like we need this is integral uh to the future of of space

00:27:37.13 we need to get this thing yeah I I would I mean I would love for us to record

00:27:42.08 it's on like 8 a.m that day pacific 10

00:27:45.20 for you guys I think it'd be so much fun are we talking a I don't they say it's

00:27:51.13 let me pull up the link I think it just the way it's phrased is like this is the

00:27:56.06 only one will it fit any of us do you think I don't dude I probably I think it

00:28:01.11 could fit you I could see it on you it says this consists of an an act

00:28:06.07 and matching with metal [Music]

00:28:09.16 exhibits where including a pair of harness holes on the side but can you

00:28:14.18 say that word that second word you said again did you say act can you say act ate

00:28:20.13 I I have no idea what that word is I have no clue

00:28:23.07 a-c-e-t-a-t-e I just care I just I I just I had never heard the word acted

00:28:27.04 before and I assumed oh can I can I do can I talk I can I call some Gavin knows

00:28:32.03 about this I have a friend speaking of pronouncing words incorrectly my friend

00:28:37.12 Jake one of my favorite bits recently is I learned that Jake thinks he he

00:28:42.10 pronounces the word tums tombs and so for like weeks now he says tombs

00:28:46.05 whatever anyone asks what's Thomas so we've been loading him up to say tombs

00:28:50.17 constantly um I'm going to call him put him on he's

00:28:53.13 got this to work the other night on halo

00:28:56.15 and I could not believe it Gavin lost it he genuinely thinks the word tums is

00:29:01.16 tombs why is tums like a soother of the stomach sort of thing yeah

00:29:06.04 can you guys hear that yep

00:29:11.03 should we be quiet yeah I don't know

00:29:16.10 why is he why isn't he picking up that's my acid according to nick

00:29:20.19 yeah no [ __ ]

00:29:22.23 trying to find him more time everybody [ __ ] knows what thom says

00:29:27.18 he doesn't seem to get it he thinks Gavin has such a funny line where he's

00:29:32.23 like what does he think he's a do you have a tummy ache he just doesn't get it

00:29:39.11 hello wait hey hey Jake oh god no why are you upset I'm having like my

00:29:44.00 my I'm having like I have like some anxiety like heartburn what is the thing

00:29:48.12 you take for it I think it starts with all anxiety that's not no no but I got

00:29:53.06 like heartburn and you know like I need a like an anti-acid type thing what what

00:29:57.22 is the tomb what is it sorry okay thank you thank you so much I'll

00:30:02.04 talk to you later are you okay love you Jake so he thinks it's tubes [Laughter]

00:30:16.21 yeah Jake listens to his podcast I'll make sure I'll tell him beforehand that

00:30:22.13 he was he was on the show so if you you hear that wonderful tombs audio

00:30:27.00 that has been I had to have a conversation with the people I regularly

00:30:31.04 play games with of like are we okay to sacrifice tombs because it has brought

00:30:36.21 laughter to our life for weeks feeding him tombs Jesus

00:30:41.12 this is like for an entire summer I had Millie convinced they were flop flips

00:30:47.01 not flip flops you sound so weird when you say it that

00:30:49.19 way where did somebody at school fight and we went all over Hawaii and back in

00:30:54.12 the whole time flop flips but she's not you know 26 or

00:30:58.15 however old Jake is no Jake's like 30.

00:31:01.12 Okay you're walking around saying dupes to be fair why would he ever answer the

00:31:06.01 phone between the hours of three and four central to Thursday yeah I told I

00:31:10.12 talked to him for a minute before I did this and I said I have to go film this

00:31:14.23 this podcast no no better I like that you used the

00:31:18.00 same method to get him to say it as you did last time I did on halo you said the

00:31:22.06 exact same thing like you had heartburn and he still went for it

00:31:26.12 he must be thinking like why doesn't he remember so yeah

00:31:30.03 we had a conversation recently that we need to change our approach or else he

00:31:33.07 is going to catch on if we all have heartburn every day

00:31:37.22 we need to take for it I love Jake um.

00:31:49.18 [Applause]

00:31:52.08 Using the internet without expressvpn is

00:31:55.07 like leaving your keys in your car while

00:31:57.05 you run into the gas station for a snack most of the time you're probably fine

00:32:00.12 but what if you come back to see someone driving off with your car

00:32:05.03 why does everyone need a vpn every time you connect to an unencrypted

00:32:08.12 network like cafes hotels or airports any hacker on the same network can gain

00:32:13.03 access to your personal data passwords financial details all that stuff

00:32:17.13 it doesn't take much technical knowledge

00:32:19.14 to hack someone just some cheap hardware is needed a smart 12 year old could do

00:32:25.07 it your data is valuable hackers can make up to a thousand dollars per person

00:32:30.08 selling personal info on the dark web why use expressvpn it has an encrypted

00:33:06.14 see and I love the spelling bee it's one of my favorite events to watch every

00:33:09.21 year so being able to easily access it because of expressvpn was awesome

00:33:14.09 uh this is more about security this read

00:36:27.16 some misunderstanding of a thing and it's unfair ooh no it's a fair

00:36:32.13 misunderstanding we need to talk about the grow tubes

00:36:35.09 because we're all very excited about them people are excited about them you

00:36:38.20 mean this you mean this wait did they send you those because I would

00:36:45.20 like one but I need to clarify okay I need to I don't know if they would send

00:36:49.18 me one because it's rtx it's launching rtx I sent you a I sent you a video the

00:36:53.22 day I got it I know you did but I didn't know if you like grabbed it like I

00:36:57.10 didn't know no no no no I'm sure they're probably mailed it to

00:37:02.02 you as well cool awesome um so they're launching at rtx but they

00:37:06.08 will be available online for everybody yes after the event we just want the

00:37:09.20 idea was we wanted to annoy as many people as possible so they're going to

00:37:15.01 drop on the event we're putting as much inventory as we can there so we can have

00:37:18.16 as many grown tubes in a contained space uh because it would be horrendous for

00:37:22.23 everybody there do you remember a couple years ago during the world cup when

00:37:26.17 everybody got excited about vuvuzela yes this is exactly [ __ ] it's called

00:37:30.12 we're getting we're trying to recreate that magic in rtx this year

00:37:34.03 exactly yeah so I just I felt it was important to clarify in the merch

00:37:37.03 meeting we had I had somebody said it perfectly where everybody who wants one

00:37:40.12 will get one they so they're launching at rtx but they will be on line two so

00:37:44.05 if you you're unable to attend that event you'll be able to go you're like

00:37:47.19 like a war general like sending all of the troops to one place it's like

00:37:51.05 there's no one already online we're sending everything to our tx first we

00:37:55.11 need fire everything well it's it's I don't know I don't

00:37:59.03 think I'm assuming face doesn't have a panel considering you and I won't be

00:38:03.01 there Gavin sadly I don't know if that's true it might just be me and Eric I'll

00:38:06.19 have to judge this is you and Eric that's great please record

00:38:10.09 please record a whole room full of people if there is a panel doing the

00:38:14.13 grown tube at once I need to yeah it'll just be an hour oh that's what I want

00:38:20.04 it's like when people will be like let's get everyone to turn

00:38:23.01 on their phone light and wave them at the same time exactly

00:38:26.02 we're gonna have so many people our tubes will grown out the sun it's gonna

00:38:29.12 be amazing but when we when we eventually have our show in

00:38:32.17 Vegas I just love the idea of people having to travel with their grown tube

00:38:37.00 like having to bring it like this [Laughter]

00:38:42.00 I wonder if it would qualify for like you know you can't travel with liquid

00:38:47.04 containers and stuff what's the volume of our grow tube oh no

00:38:52.04 I'm sure it'll be fine [Laughter]

00:39:15.11 the uh of the port a-potty tiki mugs I never thought we would have another

00:39:20.13 piece of merchandise that was as complicated to get made and take as long

00:41:01.07 harness I just really I want more clothing with harness holes you never

00:41:05.11 know when you need them maybe I could get lowered from the

00:41:08.15 ceiling at the end of it.

00:41:12.02 I'm gonna write down to talk to Eric about

00:41:16.10 I'll tell you this Andrew if you buy me a bunch of delicious cosmic crisp apples

00:41:21.11 for my birthday and they show up I'm not going to take one bite out of one throw

00:41:24.15 it in a river and then dump the rest in a trash can on the way out who did that

00:41:29.03 oh I don't know is that was that Kevin uh Eric did it I see so you said on the

00:41:34.19 water and since he's a near the water guy I didn't I didn't associate well we

00:41:40.12 were on the he threw it in the water we were on the boat oh oh god [Laughter]

00:41:46.04 they had cosmic crisps in the the grocery flyer where I get my groceries

00:41:51.02 from this right I'm very excited made my week it's the lucky week this week I

00:41:56.00 didn't realize that now we have cemented

00:41:58.02 that uh people are going to notify us uh

00:42:01.05 I suspect for the rest of our individual lives about every new apple drop that

00:42:05.22 comes out uh from I don't hate it I don't hate it either I don't hate

00:42:09.05 anything fan of it it's it's like subscribing to a newsletter you forgot

00:42:12.23 you subscribed every once in a while they just like hit

00:42:16.08 you up with like hey there's a new yellow apple looks good

00:42:19.20 like a division to thank me later yeah that's awesome that's a great idea

00:42:23.23 I was gonna say uh because eric's not here we should do something uh we would

00:42:28.00 never do wally's here and we should all say one nice thing about him because

00:42:31.07 he'll never hear it so but then I don't know but then he but then I got annoyed

00:42:34.21 with him for not being here so maybe I don't want to say nice stuff about him

00:42:38.21 I really feel like that was a conversation for you to have before we recorded

00:42:42.20 it feels like you're torn between ideas well I didn't have a lot of choice you

00:42:46.10 uh you were going on about your book club my book club

00:42:48.21 oh that's fair there was a lack of pleasantries we're all thrown off from

00:42:52.13 the lack of a lack of pleasantry talk what's that Andrew what's the best look

00:42:56.02 you've read in the last 72 days I I don't think I've read a book uh maybe like

00:43:00.12 the game manual for fast and furious crossroads I guess if we want to call

00:43:04.12 that a book I don't think you can call that book yeah then I don't think I've

00:43:08.11 read a book in the last 70 days why didn't you ask us if we'd read a book in

00:43:12.06 the last 72 days because it's just pleasantry talk no that's just being

00:43:15.23 silly is this silly to see where it goes I don't there's no reason it was a

00:43:20.00 completely random number why did I pick number 101 for like the episode the

00:43:23.10 paladio for Geoff or whatever just random huh zero logic went into it

00:43:28.02 can I talk about one of my favorite events that I wish I would have talked

00:43:32.02 about last week that happened I missed out oh

00:43:36.03 the nba finals started on the same night as the greatest sporting event of the

00:43:40.11 year the scripps national spelling bee and boy was it a barn burner did you

00:43:44.21 pick a kid I picked a kid my favorite tradition continued there's

00:43:49.21 one person in our league who picked the child uh yeah I'm the vacavic

00:43:58.23 the person that consistently takes the first kid eliminated got eliminated

00:44:03.20 first once again it was great the disappointment it was fantastic my kid I

00:44:08.20 think placed fifth it was a wild show again there was a woman this child was

00:44:14.02 eliminated and she left the stage and then 10 minutes later they said actually

00:44:18.18 we [ __ ] up you can come back you're back in this competition oh so there's

00:44:23.14 like a misspelling that that was actually spelled correctly no it was

00:44:27.04 like we so the second round is they they

00:44:29.16 give uh you have to guess the definition

00:44:31.19 of a word so they'll tell you what it is and they'll give you three options

00:44:36.04 and technically how they phrased it two of the three would be correct and she

00:44:40.07 picked one that they didn't view as correct but upon review they're like ah

00:44:43.21 you could make the argument that that was the correct answer so she got to

00:44:47.07 come back the show opened with a kid got an answer wrong in the room before

00:44:53.07 his parents disputed it and they decided he could enter the oh there was his

00:44:59.09 parents were very upset about it and so they decided if he could spell

00:45:03.09 one word correctly before the show started he could then enter the finals

00:45:07.05 so the first it opened with a spelling of a kid trying to get in and he got it

00:45:11.05 I'm so glad it would be so embarrassing to [ __ ] that word up like as the show

00:45:14.17 was starting and you're just yeah no you you're done you imagine you're double

00:45:19.11 eliminated that car ride home oh it'd be so awkward

00:45:22.20 because he gave he kind of had vibes of I'm not super into this but my parents

00:45:27.01 loved this his dad was so [ __ ] pumped when he made it into the finals he got

00:45:31.12 it right um so the girl got eliminated she came back

00:45:35.15 it went into the very first spell off the scripts spell off so there's an

00:45:40.19 overtime round it's like penalty kicks where each kid goes up and they have to

00:45:45.15 spell as many words as they can in 90

00:45:48.03 seconds so like they feed them a word and then they have to spell it and they

00:45:51.07 hit a buzzer and it goes to the next word they just go back and forth and it

00:45:56.06 is one of the craziest things I've ever seen oh speed spelling is wild

00:46:01.18 uh and didn't the girl who got the person who got kicked out and then

00:46:06.10 brought back in win she won it all the girl that kicked out

00:46:09.12 she's unstopped every time she'd come to

00:46:12.08 the stage I was making terminator noises you could not terminate she was like

00:46:17.16 every time and she would just nail words

00:46:20.00 they got to that spell off it was not it was like she didn't breathe do you

00:46:24.01 remember 26 words oh not even close you think I [ __ ] know these words

00:46:28.01 when I can't even say acetite or whatever the [ __ ] that word was I don't know

00:46:32.06 I don't know six letter words I watch I watched the spell off Gavin

00:46:36.15 and I'd never heard of any of those words ever before and angie's not wrong

00:46:41.21 she had like the focus of a swan she was locked in

00:46:45.07 like a swan looking at your back yeah she had my yeah yeah

00:46:53.18 so what was the word that with the definition that they they gave it back I

00:46:58.19 don't remember it was like something like

00:47:01.13 it was a group of bees it meant like I think the definition was it was like a

00:47:05.12 group of a certain animal type and they had two different animals listed and she

00:47:10.12 picked the wrong animal and they're like

00:47:10.12 no the correct answer is b not it's bees not geese and they're like well

00:47:15.08 technically you can make the case that geese would also fall under it's a weird

00:47:20.15 like technicality thing like a murder of crows like yes

00:47:24.12 those are great I love those what you call specific animal groups

00:47:27.16 murder prose is a good one how does that get decided I don't I mean how do we

00:47:31.09 decide any word we've had this talk before what would it be if uh podcasters

00:47:35.17 were a group like coming towards you what could you call it uh just

00:47:40.15 unfortunate general population I don't know seems like everyone has a podcast

00:47:44.14 a general population of podcasters a general population no it'd be like a is

00:47:49.07 now a group of podcasters are coming out of you or podcast audiences like if we

00:47:53.05 if all the three of us were coming towards you what would the flock term be

00:47:58.04 it would be a regulation of podcasters oh regulation podcaster is that what you

00:48:03.11 said yeah a regulation they would be a regulation

00:48:07.07 a regulation of podcasters yeah you're right I miss hurt

00:48:12.02 podcast leavers nick says

00:48:15.11 where's Steve I appreciate you coming up

00:48:18.17 with regulation Geoff because I was I was trying and I just could not I couldn't

00:48:24.06 find it I did my best I was looking for it I thought ad

00:48:27.10 readers were okay but it's like yeah but regulation a regulation is such a

00:48:31.12 better natural fit you found I wonder if that applies to

00:48:34.17 any other animal what do you mean there's a regulation

00:48:37.23 a regular oh you think there's a group of animals called a regulation yeah

00:48:42.04 list of regulation of buffalo or something if it

00:48:45.12 was gonna like it obviously doesn't but if it was going to what animal do you

00:48:50.17 think it would be oh that's like the most bog standard animal

00:48:55.12 I hate that with the amount of time I've spent with you my brain said the exact

00:49:00.20 same thing internally I just said that I

00:49:04.06 [ __ ] hate because there's no way that I'm naturally saying that I've just

00:49:08.06 spent too much time with you bog standard uh

00:49:12.00 like what I know what do you think of if if you think of an animal hmm

00:49:17.03 well I think see I was thinking large too in kind of

00:49:20.15 the same areas I think it's funnier if it's like an animal you don't see often

00:49:26.20 like a regulation of giraffes the regulation of giraffes isn't bad the

00:49:30.20 first thing that came to my mind and I feel pretty good about is the regulation

00:49:34.13 of dolphins I was also I'm a woman guy yeah uh regulation of dolphins yeah I

00:49:40.13 immediately went to land I feel like land is the standard but but I guess

00:49:44.22 there is more water than land on earth I think I think water is the standard

00:49:48.13 buddy yeah yeah I'm saying I'm turning around to it

00:49:52.16 a group of goldfish is apparently called a troubling which is great

00:49:58.21 that's what we would be yeah what would you call two two uh clusters

00:50:04.12 of goldfish troublings what double trouble Andrew oh

00:50:09.09 I'm glad I didn't make that joke I was happy that I missed

00:50:15.11 first time I've ever thought this but should we in the podcast earlier

00:50:20.13 double trouble I think if that's where we are maybe

00:50:25.12 a double troubling of goldfish.

00:50:29.11 I like flamingo as a flamboyance a group of flamingos flamboyance coyotes are a

00:50:35.12 band a band of coyotes that's [ __ ]

00:50:37.20 cool this is where Eric if he was here would be yelling at us to stop just

00:50:42.06 reading stuff off the internet this is part of the show nick said that

00:50:48.00 is cool so I think Nixon I want to be in a band a swarm

00:50:52.09 it's for bees yeah I mean there's some [ __ ] ones but

00:50:56.21 caterpillars are an army an army of caterpillars who decide these I don't know

00:51:01.14 that's a great question who does decide these I wonder how many caterpillars is

00:51:07.12 required for an army yeah when you say army it makes you think hundreds like

00:51:13.03 I think of like there needs to be a set of of tears like you need a general

00:51:17.12 you could have five people and if one of them's like a general and a sergeant I

00:51:21.10 think you're an army yeah I don't think I don't think caterpillars are like a

00:51:24.14 hive mind I assume there's a there's a hierarchy there that there there's a

00:51:27.14 lead right it's not like ants and even then ants have a queen right I

00:51:32.17 think the great play if you refer to yourself as an army there is an implied

00:51:37.23 largeness that doesn't have to be there like if we said we are an army people

00:51:42.03 would assume there's more of us and there might not be

00:51:44.16 that just might be a good strategic decision caterpillars maybe just want to

00:51:49.12 seem bigger than they are how many are everywhere in an army

00:51:53.13 or they can't be you think there's a clear line I'd be shocked if there was

00:51:58.19 like a definitive number yeah this is useless it would be useless

00:52:03.12 uh okay so the the dictionary definition of army is an

00:52:07.05 organized military force equipped for fighting on land so it really I if you

00:52:12.19 could organize two people I think two people could technically be an army as

00:52:16.12 long as they're on land there wouldn't be dolphins no such thing as an army of

00:52:20.19 dolphins that's a great point that would be

00:52:23.12 terrifying though isn't that a movie there's a movie about that right an army

00:52:27.12 of dolphins or is it one there's a movie where the dolphin is trying to

00:52:32.15 assassinate a president that's a movie but I don't know if that's an army what

00:52:38.00 the [ __ ] are you talking about there's I didn't make that up I don't think

00:52:41.13 dolphin assassinate president movie they like train a dolphin to kill the

00:52:46.08 president the day of the dolphin I was hoping so much that was a dream

00:52:51.14 marine biologist Jake and Maggie Tyrell have for many years been doing dolph

00:52:56.05 dolphin research in Florida keys and have even coached some dolphins to speak

00:52:59.12 primitive English but when two of the dolphins are kidnapped an investigation

00:53:03.03 proves that the trails financial backers the Franklin foundation have had a

00:53:06.23 sinister intention all along the dolphins are to be used to deliver and

00:53:11.05 detonate explosive beneath the president's yacht that's right what is

00:53:16.00 this movie called the day of the dolphin

00:53:19.11 the day all right hold on the day of the dolphin could you imagine the attitude

00:53:23.10 that the tag line of a movie is unwittingly he trained a dolphin to kill

00:53:28.01 the president of the united states that's what you're gonna put on that

00:53:33.05 dude it's got George c Scott in it it's got patent in it oh that's amazing uh

00:53:37.10 stream where are we gonna watch this so that we can make a video out of it oh we

00:53:41.10 can watch it on amazon prime perfect we'll add it to uh we're watching mvp2

00:53:46.00 what's the other one I think we agreed on a different movie recently as well

00:53:51.18 mvp2 day of the dolphin uh there's something else

00:53:54.15 well we there was discussion of anaconda

00:53:57.01 there was that's a great I don't know if it was to do that I I honestly I'd

00:54:01.00 rather I would I think lake placid is a better version of that movie I'd rather

00:54:05.03 really yeah I there's only one part of lake placid I

00:54:08.09 really enjoy and it's the fact that there's a character in it that is like a

00:54:12.21 specialist in alligators or whatever and he sets all these traps up and only

00:54:17.01 one of the main characters keeps stepping in them like it never actually

00:54:20.19 impacts the character and it's like a running gag throughout the movie that

00:54:24.02 this one guy gets stuck in six of his traps and there's no like payoff to it

00:54:27.21 it's just this thing that keeps happening throughout the film and I

00:54:32.15 really enjoy that uh it's a dumb movie sorry it's yeah it's like

00:54:37.14 it's alligator anaconda yeah but I feel like to a lesser extent

00:54:42.02 like I think anaconda is more schlocky than like placid

00:54:44.17 like placid is dumb anaconda's schlocky I'll say this lake placid has Betty

00:54:49.07 white in it it does that is true the legend I wonder who won that contest

00:54:55.20 and I wonder if they regret running that contest I talked about in the show

00:55:00.06 before oh died so shortly after that oh yeah it

00:55:03.13 was like to celebrate her hundredth which I don't think she reached sadly

00:55:08.19 she was so close she was so close she was so close I have a question about when

00:55:13.12 when you tell a story on this show something that happened in your personal

00:55:18.17 life and you you tell it to like somebody involved with the story like when you

00:55:23.02 fill somebody else in on the story what are you doing your first telling to the

00:55:26.23 story how often do you hear a different perspective of

00:55:29.21 what you're gonna tell like how often does that improve the story to your like

00:55:33.15 change your your perspective on it every time what's the example so the shampoo

00:55:39.12 bottle story that I told in the episode that just came out yeah

00:55:42.14 the following day like the first person I told that story to was my partner

00:55:46.22 and as I'm telling the story and I'm halfway through they cut me off and

00:55:52.04 immediately just said wait you had my shampoo bottle in your ass in disgust

00:55:57.02 which is an aspect of it that I never considered

00:56:00.14 I never thought about like that that would be way worse than waking them up

00:56:06.02 that they now have my ass all over the bottle I've been putting that on my hair

00:56:10.21 yeah like I'm gonna have to grab this bottle all the time that was in your ass

00:56:16.00 now thank you for the kindness of doing that

00:56:19.18 just curious if you guys had examples of like different I'll I'll say that like

00:56:25.05 Emily at least in my experience is like a one-person comedy writing room and so

00:56:29.05 when I'm going through and like telling the swan story or working it out uh

00:56:33.23 she'll be like uh yeah but didn't this kind of happen or like don't forget

00:56:37.12 about this thing or like in gogo now she'd be like oh it's it's it was funny

00:56:42.08 the way you said it this time be sure to say it like that and uh

00:56:45.16 I found it to be invaluable yeah yeah what is it they say about like when you

00:56:48.23 tell a story you're only telling it from like the

00:56:51.20 you're only telling the last time you remembered it so like the more you tell

00:56:55.07 it or like the more time between it just gets less accurate over time it's I I

00:56:59.20 find that a lot with if I tell a story like 10 times and then

00:57:02.19 I tell it for the 11th time and someone from the original moment was there

00:57:06.15 they'll add in stuff that I've forgotten

00:57:08.17 I'm like oh how did I leave that out and it's so it's so like overwritten by the

00:57:12.13 yeah by the times I've told it it's part

00:57:14.12 of why I'm having so much fun doing that other show with gus is because we're

00:57:17.22 retelling stories from like the early days of roost that we haven't

00:57:21.21 told in years and years and years and he reminds me of like entire events that

00:57:26.11 I'd forgotten about you know just spun off of like one story and it's like it's

00:57:32.02 awesome so that other show you do I mean to bring this up is anima

00:57:36.19 m.a it has been such a delight to listen to that show really

00:57:41.20 yeah I've really enjoyed it because I I love you and we have this great

00:57:46.06 friendship but I also think you're so funny in content and the thing like face

00:57:51.00 I don't listen to it at all as we've covered for reasons that's you displayed

00:57:54.10 perfectly earlier in this episode there's nothing

00:57:57.05 that'll make you hate yourself faster than re-listening to something you're

00:58:01.05 part of I'm so thankful Gavin that you're willing to proof these for us um

00:58:05.03 so I've missed seeing you in content and to like listen to a thing where you're

00:58:09.00 you're just you're so funny and it's such a relaxed environment for a show

00:58:13.03 and the friendship between you and gus is so genuine it has been such a joy to

00:58:17.14 listen to that to that show so I'd highly recommend anybody who listens to

00:58:21.05 the face check out amma oh great series especially if you you love Geoff

00:58:25.22 well thank you Andrew you haven't been exposed to gus maybe if you're outside

00:58:30.09 of the rooster teeth world he's uh he's a tour de force uh in his own right can

00:58:34.20 I a guest thing that I feel like I keep meaning to bring up and I'm so glad that

00:58:38.20 this conversation led me to this thought before break [ __ ] started we've done

00:58:44.19 several of them at this point nearly a year I feel like the starting point of

00:58:48.21 break [ __ ] was the fact that gus has a [ __ ] garage filled with baseball

00:58:53.16 cards and it has never been mentioned or searched for what is this does he

00:58:57.12 still have them yeah are we ever gonna get those cards it's so funny it's so

00:59:01.20 funny you mentioned that because that popped into my head I'm actually I

00:59:05.08 actually tweeted a photo earlier today I'm trying to like consolidate all the

00:59:09.05 all the face break [ __ ] stuff because it's just like in boxes around my house

00:59:12.06 and in my car and I'm trying to make some sense out of it because hopefully

00:59:15.13 at some point we'll move into a a studio that has a a set that I can design and

00:59:20.01 leave because right now I have to tear it down and build it up yeah down every

00:59:24.03 time it's a [ __ ] transient nightmare uh and that popped into my head I'm like

00:59:28.13 all right doesn't guys have like 40000

00:59:30.10 baseball cards we're supposed to get I I gotta we just gotta do it like at the

00:59:34.18 time he mentioned it I thought it would be fun to make like a little docu thing

00:59:39.07 about it and like document driving down there together and like make a little

00:59:42.22 video out of it but at this point I just want to get him you know if he still if

00:59:46.03 he still has access to him which I think he does I'm glad you brought it up

00:59:49.07 because uh I feel like it could be a huge and fun thing for us to to [ __ ]

00:59:53.12 with and it just kind of like a lot of face jokes that just kind of fell by the

00:59:58.01 wayside for other stuff yeah I'd love to have an update for that or if you guys

01:00:03.07 even just like recorded a car like on the road podcast

01:00:07.08 that would be fun that would be really fun and I haven't been down to like the

01:00:10.15 town where he grew up I used to go down there uh early on in our friendship and

01:00:14.10 like spend the weekend with his mom and him and yeah explore Mexico and stuff

01:00:19.04 uh why are you laughing at that I just you would never do that now

01:00:24.00 that's so funny oh yeah no well yeah the difference between being

01:00:29.16 46 and 26 is pretty stark yeah yeah but weren't you still married back then uh

01:00:35.10 yeah sometimes I go away from weekend I don't know why that's weird to me yeah

01:00:39.23 it'd just be like I'm gonna go go spend two days in with gus's family yeah I've

01:00:44.07 done that a bunch of times while I was married and then also I was the worst

01:00:47.12 for a while yeah yeah fantastic nica this is nick had had to do the Eric

01:00:52.12 thing and tell us to wrap up he did

01:01:00.00 there are times where like but between recordings we'll be texting each other a

01:01:04.13 lot I don't know at least from my side it was very quiet I think we're all busy

01:01:07.15 the last week this is nice this felt like a really relaxed like get-together

01:01:11.22 ketchup type episode is it bad though since it was mentioned I couldn't think

01:01:16.18 of a single nice thing to say about Eric [Laughter]

01:01:20.15 well I would give you homework but we don't want to we don't want to do that

01:01:26.02 to Andrew no not again I was going to say because I was I was struggling too uh

01:01:31.16 you guys he's got a good I like his fashion sense

01:01:35.18 I think he dresses well I'm into it yeah really have a good style yeah

01:01:40.19 I uh I think he's he's very fun he's a he reminds me of he's older than me but

01:01:46.03 it's like it's hanging out with him is like hanging out with someone when I was

01:01:50.12 in my 20s yeah and I think that's nice about him I will say one one thing that

01:01:54.06 I like about Eric is just the longevity of how long I've known him and in the

01:01:59.10 different contexts you know because he was like you know he he would like help

01:02:03.14 out and was a part of mega 64 which was like a group of peers uh in the internet

01:02:08.12 space that we would do events with and stuff and so we've known them for I

01:02:11.15 don't know so yeah since like year three of roost so probably like I don't know

01:02:16.04 15 years or something but I knew him in the in the context of like getting a

01:02:19.17 beer with him at a convention in Iowa or you know being next to like

01:02:24.12 like throwing t-shirts at him uh across from the aisle at a you know at

01:02:30.06 comic-con or whatever and uh it is so weird now that we

01:02:33.10 make a show together yeah I mean the face as a whole I think it that it came

01:02:37.19 together at all is a bizarre thing yeah he went from someone who I try to ignore

01:02:41.23 as much as possible [Laughter]

01:02:44.15 listen to whatever he says anything I always thought that he was like

01:02:49.12 I don't this is gonna border on being too nice uh but I'll be honest uh I love

01:02:54.15 that group the mega 64 guys uh I love all of them in their own way uh

01:02:59.12 although I love uh well no I'm not gonna pick favorites uh I think they're all

01:03:03.00 great but I always thought Eric was the funniest among them and I always thought

01:03:06.09 it was strange I was like well why is that the guy that's helping him out is a

01:03:09.12 little bit funnier than the rest of them I wonder why that is

01:03:12.23 he's my favorite like there's certain topics that one and he's like the person

01:03:18.04 I will talk to you about like I was on twitter the other day and I saw this

01:03:23.01 thread where somebody who used to produce podcasts for the wwe left and

01:03:26.19 was talking about that experience they said that Geoff hardy has the worst wi-fi

01:03:32.17 they've ever encountered and that he was wonderful but just the most absolutely

01:03:37.04 dismal wi-fi and just like please get some better [ __ ] wi-fi Geoff hardy and

01:03:41.03 I said that to Eric I was just like the only person I know who I could send that

01:03:44.05 to and have like a great conversation about

01:03:46.16 of course Geoff hardy would have [ __ ]

01:03:48.11 internet like that is it just checks out on every level I'll say that Eric is uh

01:03:53.18 he's really good at sending me funny hot takes during basketball games oh yeah

01:03:57.23 game four or what yeah four I can't count we just did four right notes yeah

01:04:01.18 two one I'm sorry I've been out of I've been out of the [ __ ] is wrong what are

01:04:06.10 you talking about I I game four of the series is coming out and I just yeah

01:04:10.14 I was I discounted game two we're talking about the celtics golden state

01:04:14.02 warriors the finals I couldn't believe they won game one game two I didn't

01:04:17.23 really care about because I felt like there was no way they could win I did

01:04:21.01 care you know what I mean like no it's a scheduled scheduled loss yeah and the

01:04:25.09 fact that they've won game three now makes me think that they might actually

01:04:28.20 win it all so I'm very excited but I also expect game four to be a loss it's

01:04:33.14 ludicrous to think that the Boston celtics are two wins away from being nba

01:04:37.23 champions and we are not we're not a basketball podcast we're a baseball

01:04:41.18 we're actually we're a baseball equipment podcast so I guess it's like

01:04:45.12 there's an affinity there but I don't want to get like too deep into sports

01:04:49.03 because then nobody everybody be mad at us uh

01:04:51.11 oh you know what we should probably end though uh let me just tell you guys I

01:04:55.11 wish there was a funnier bit to it but I got the new bike and it works great

01:05:00.13 oh oh that's so awesome is it the seat any better no it's the seats horse no

01:05:05.01 no that's okay that's okay what I just have to switch out I probably have to

01:05:08.15 make a few modifications um I'll probably have to change the seat and I

01:05:12.00 might change the the the pedals out for the ones that I'm using now because

01:05:15.09 they're grippier but uh but yeah it's it's awesome you

01:05:18.13 know the shitty Instagram ads you get sometimes it's like hey here's a box of

01:05:22.21 goo put your foot in it and we'll send it back to us

01:05:25.15 is there one for your ass like you could just sit in a box and it molds your ass

01:05:31.09 and they'll print you a a bike seat I would pay a thousand dollars for that

01:05:35.03 yeah I would custom I

01:05:42.13 have you ever seen the movie safe men Geoff no

01:05:46.02 the character sam Rockwell in it has a fake ass have you considered getting an

01:05:51.10 ass just for riding your bike like an attachable ass so I went I thought about

01:05:57.00 like an episode of king of the hill when hank was having trouble sitting in his

01:06:00.09 truck in his riding lawn mower it was hurting and it was because his butt wore

01:06:04.08 away and he had to get like butt implants

01:06:06.12 and I was like [ __ ] maybe I wore my butt

01:06:08.23 off and I need to go get butt implants so I went to the doctor the doctor was

01:06:10.10 like that was like you're a [ __ ]

01:06:13.03 idiot I was like all right this is why I don't go to the doctor

01:06:17.15 know you see those time lapses in wildlife where like a river will slowly

01:06:22.10 erode rock it just time lapsed your ass as it got smaller

01:06:25.17 hey I gotta I gotta go get the door real fast just a second

01:06:29.06 oh I feel like would have been already why wouldn't you just yeah just wrap up

01:06:32.23 the pot thank you well hang on now that Geoff's gone that's reduced the amount of

01:06:37.06 people in this to uh pleasantries amounts so you could just finish your

01:06:41.20 pleasantries with nick oh I I felt like pl

01:06:44.06 no you don't as somebody who's not part of pleasantries that's not how

01:06:47.16 pleasantries work I thought it works when you're not recording and there's

01:06:50.21 not everyone here no it's before it starts the pleasantries lead into the

01:06:53.23 show the purpose of the pleasantries is that it like you have a conversation

01:06:59.01 you calm down you have some laughs and then you go into the thing

01:07:02.11 pleasantries are great I'm back unless you're no continue with

01:07:05.16 your pleasantries talk sorry I had to get medicine for it

01:07:08.18 who doesn't want to do pleasantries yeah it's not pleasantries you can't have

01:07:13.11 pleasantries at the end of a show well but you guys do that like when we that's

01:07:17.04 not pleasantries what is it post trees posters okay well you guys can you guys

01:07:21.19 do posteries like the two of you for hours to the point where I thought

01:07:25.14 I thought you were doing a secret podcast

01:07:28.16 like you guys are doing like a post show where you just make fun of Geoff for an

01:07:32.02 hour that's what happens in my head I think that started

01:07:35.12 because my computer is so [ __ ] it takes like 12 minutes for me to export and

01:07:40.00 everybody leaves so I'm just sitting in the channel by myself and Gavin was like

01:07:44.04 what's going on in here and then it just

01:07:46.06 became a tradition that Gavin comes back in as I'm exporting we have a little

01:07:49.08 talk yeah I'd say every uh every single recording we have a five minute

01:07:53.11 well it's not apparently it's not pleasant but it's some sort of

01:07:56.21 conversation and then it's definitely pleasant it's just not a pleasant tree

01:08:00.04 it's not pleasant trees I I really I think that's kind of I think that's

01:08:05.01 [ __ ] dude I think it's I think it's plus trees I don't think

01:08:08.13 pleasantries is dictated by when in the conversation it happens I think I think

01:08:13.12 my definition of the spirit of the show pleasantries is before the podcast

01:08:16.20 starts I think we have a hundred plus episodes where that sets when the time

01:08:20.04 is maybe not pleasantries in the what if those are regulation pleasantries and

01:08:24.00 what we have afterwards is deregulated pleasantries can I say something I

01:08:27.02 learned recently not all pleasantries are alike you got to be very selective

01:08:31.20 with your pleasantries you should talk about that that's uh

01:08:35.06 there are sometimes you go into meetings and pleasantries can be disastrous.

01:08:41.12 I had a fun meeting with you guys that day that was no it was a great meeting I

01:08:47.10 just um I was around new people I'm a social mess oh it was awkward I [ __ ]

01:08:52.11 it up so good listening to Andrew try and have pleasantries with two people

01:08:55.23 he'd never met or spoken to before and like trying to feel them out it was

01:09:00.01 oh it was so funny I wish it was being recorded it was so awkward you were

01:09:04.21 trying so hard you were really pulling you

01:09:08.21 you can say a lot about me I do try hard that is a consistent I will say

01:09:14.02 outside of the context of face where I do everything a little differently I

01:09:19.12 show up for every work-related meeting three minutes late so I can avoid

01:09:23.10 pleasantries it's a good way to go it is it's something I've different it is a

01:09:27.14 different animal outside of this podcast pleasantries it is yes I've I learned

01:09:31.18 that the hard way what did you think of my input nick says you want me to cut

01:09:36.04 that no wait what what oh Geoff Geoff's thing not

01:09:40.00 my thing showing up three minutes late so I don't have to do pleasantries

01:09:44.10 no I don't think that's a rude thing no I just pretend to be coming in late for

01:09:48.08 another meeting they don't know

01:09:50.19 the idea that you're just sat at your desk and then right before the meeting

01:09:54.05 starts all right before you join you just run like five laps around your

01:09:57.07 chair and you're like oh hey guys sorry I just come in half this other thing

01:10:01.20 yeah every meeting you start on the phone

01:10:04.10 with somebody else like you joined the meeting and then you're just on a fake

01:10:08.06 call everyone so also nick is like now they know here's

01:10:11.13 the deal nick no they don't no one in our company listens to this podcast the

01:10:15.15 amount of conversations I have to have where I explain the most basic [ __ ]

01:10:19.12 about replace the people is ludicrous there's no way I could I could say

01:10:24.05 anything I wanted to on this podcast and it wouldn't matter uh in the context of

01:10:28.13 the the people that we work with because they would never ever

01:10:31.12 even on accident hear it I've seen you explain to people at the company like

01:10:35.11 what works about face and then you'll go

01:10:37.11 into a meeting a month later and explain the thing you were talking about oh

01:10:42.02 what's that it's like no one's no one can bring themselves to delve in

01:10:45.19 it's just like a lot it's a deep lore about nothing it's the face curse that

01:10:50.09 it's not just the podcast it extends to conversations and meetings too whereas

01:10:53.14 like as soon as the meeting about the face thing is over everybody else from

01:10:58.04 every other department in the company their brain toilet flushes too and

01:11:01.09 they're like that [Laughter]

01:11:06.21 I have been enjoying the weekly newsletter that's been coming out the

01:11:11.04 internal one that says to say that anal passage is the top seller of everything

01:11:16.13 because you know there's everyone at the company just thinking I don't even want

01:11:20.09 to look up what that could be about dude I don't want to get too granular into

01:11:26.08 sales and stuff uh but let me just say that uh the face the annual anal passage

01:11:31.12 shirt is it's nearer four figures in sales which is absolutely ludicrous

01:11:37.06 so stupid I can't [ __ ] believe it I can't

01:11:40.04 believe that in like 19 and a half years of selling t-shirts online

01:11:44.11 uh through various productions uh this is like anal passages approaching like

01:11:50.06 top 50 for the history of the company at some point I think you know it's [ __ ]

01:11:56.03 ridiculous wow I love it that's awesome yeah that also may not be true

01:12:00.09 off the top of my head no that's great let's just claim it's true that's

01:12:04.10 fantastic it's like it's like baochika bow wow uh camping is a legitimate

01:12:09.16 strategy zombie plan and the caboose shirt and anal passage

01:12:17.20 that's a great lie like even if it's not

01:12:20.12 true there's some it's important to have good lies I was talking to a friend

01:12:24.12 recently and uh they were in this dance competition that was like every school

01:12:30.10 uh in this area competed and they only read out the top 10

01:12:35.12 names of the thing so one of the kids is the lie said they placed 11th because

01:12:40.02 they only did like they only read 10

01:12:42.08 like nobody knows I don't think they even ranked 10. But almost everybody in

01:12:45.23 the group believed that they came 11th like they genuinely thought that and it

01:12:49.05 got printed in the newsletter and there are kids who lived like 20 years of

01:12:53.00 their lives thinking they placed the 11th in the finals of this dance

01:12:58.04 competition it's like complete [ __ ]

01:13:01.05 so even if the anal passage shirt isn't in the top whatever you said it's a

01:13:04.16 great lie let's just go with that we should probably wrap up that this has

01:13:09.12 gone on way longer than it's supposed to yeah nick tried to end it several times

01:13:14.00 I was trying to cut it off at like the 40 minute mark but uh.

01:13:18.16 [Laughter]

01:13:23.12 I gotta say I don't know what it is uh but the last two episodes we've recorded

01:13:28.23 after I've uh I've just felt really really good really good about until I

01:13:32.12 listened to that one episode 106. So I'll continue to go get about 107

01:13:35.13 because I'll never hear it but uh great I feel like this one was pretty good too

01:13:38.15 I feel like I've been enjoying it's very

01:13:40.12 sweet enjoying this little like phase of the podcast that we're in

01:13:43.18 what is this phase it's not really driven by a specific thing it's just

01:13:47.18 sort of a intermediary phase yeah just kind of relax just catching up

01:13:53.08 with each other it's very genuine it's almost like it's almost like um

01:13:57.06 it's almost like a like mid-season mid-episode pleasantries that's a great

01:14:01.10 way to put it this does feel mid-season mid-episode pleasantries I'm really

01:14:05.22 excited to find out what constitutes a switch of volumes oh yeah yeah the

01:14:09.11 volume is you owe me both that could be like a decade long volume one

01:14:14.00 I've just been what season are we in we're in season four I've just been

01:14:19.05 throwing volume one out to extend the title uh

01:14:22.08 but I do I do assume there will be a volume two at some point and as soon as

01:14:26.02 that happens we'll do volume two for a while and then it will be revealed that

01:14:30.13 it's like chapter one or something cause we'll still be in one of something

01:14:34.03 edition one

01:14:37.07 all right let's stop talking to each other well except for YouTube you guys

01:14:41.00 will continue to talk for a brief period of time but I'm gonna stop talking to

01:14:44.08 you guys and Geoff I won't see you in Vegas all right Gavin I won't see you

01:14:47.08 this weekend uh but I hope you have a great time I assume that because we're

01:14:51.13 not spending time together uh in Austin or anywhere else the weather will be

01:14:55.11 lovely and you'll be able to swim and get some 42 degrees this weekend yeah

01:16:12.20 was excited I thought you guys in Vegas for a week I still it was the whole

01:16:17.12 thing with like apparently the tickets were

01:16:19.16 were like cheaper if we came back on a different day and it would only talk
