00:00:42.15 Geoff what is a trailer for a movie that you're like this trailer looks [ __ ]

00:00:47.16 great and then you saw the movie and you were disappointed uh

00:00:52.07 hold on I'm not recording what the f wait great

00:00:55.20 hey who who is actually recording at three

00:00:58.19 as soon as you joined I was recording before three it's three and I'm

00:01:03.19 recording it's three o'clock right now you you are late to no it is not three

00:01:08.10 on the dot somehow being lost to join I was the

00:01:12.02 only one on time yes yeah hey hey Gavin a hundred percent agree with you well I

00:01:16.18 mean everybody is technically still on time because it's still three o'clock

00:01:20.21 but I was prepping the video everything that I needed to support we were here

00:01:24.06 reporting Gavin is the one Gavin is the one who is on top thank you Gavin who

00:01:28.17 cares the professional cool congratulations Gavin you're the

00:01:32.15 professional thanks man yes all we all hope to to someday aspire

00:01:36.23 like you you are our first question

00:01:45.11 in terms of professionalism and talent in terms of uh I don't know tone effort

00:01:52.17 general uh demeanor it really doesn't get better than you so Gavin please show

00:01:58.06 us how it's done I wasn't the one saying look

00:02:01.16 I don't I don't think he I think he already did I think the act was done he

00:02:05.12 did show us how it was done by being on time I don't think there's anything to

00:02:09.03 go beyond that I think I know he was on time I know he

00:02:11.07 was on time because I was here when I saw him come in that's true also on time

00:02:15.09 I was prepping a video because I knew the size would be too big to send you

00:02:18.13 guys through discord and it would be a whole fluffal in the middle of the

00:02:23.07 episode so I was sending in a different way

00:02:25.09 uh while you guys were talking about uh Colin quinn's film prowess

00:02:29.16 he knows a lot about movies I'm surprised a great guy very very funny comedian

00:02:35.13 very funny comedian I also enjoyed his book his special one of my favorites are

00:02:39.01 unique he does more like essays than I'd say like traditional stand-up it's

00:02:43.22 fascinating like he tells more of like their historical specials um

00:02:47.14 but anyway I want to know the trailer thing Geoff do you have a great

00:02:50.19 storyteller in general also one of the best guests in the history of the Howard

00:02:54.21 stern show he had a story about [ __ ]

00:02:57.18 a cat that you would not believe he also had a story about [ __ ] an old

00:03:00.17 lady in a hallway and having her fall down and hit her head and leaving her

00:03:04.05 there for dead wait what yeah he told him on the heart storm show oh oh like

00:03:08.10 she's selling the ladies all the way she fell and hit her head and he felt bad

00:03:12.11 and he left and he has no idea what if he accidentally killed her I don't know

00:03:16.23 I guess then she's dead and he's a murderer

00:03:20.02 anyway he knows a lot about film he does hello and welcome to another episode of

00:03:26.02 the F**kFuckFacePodcast I believe this is episode 80 if I'm correct which puts us

00:03:30.14 I want to say in the back half of season two year two is that correct I think

00:03:35.06 we've kind of gone over it there's no real measuring system for what well I

00:03:38.20 think there is we just need to sit down and figure it out we're approaching a

00:03:42.13 number of episodes that no one can pitch in baseball that's true

00:03:46.16 I think what's the fastest pitch recorded and it's probably in like over

00:03:51.15 100 I think uh I want to say 102

00:03:53.16 or so really I was thinking I was going to guess like 110 would be my guess but

00:03:58.13 I don't think that high has anyone thrown one in a vacuum what do you mean uh

00:04:03.15 like has anyone thrown one at a vacuum cleaner [Laughter]

00:04:07.14 I don't understand like why why would they have done that

00:04:11.03 well so there's no air resistant so you can throw it real fast oh okay that's I

00:04:15.13 feel like you took some leaps there I wasn't I wasn't with you I was lost

00:04:19.04 that's right I was thinking about I've never seen someone throw a vacuum there

00:04:22.17 was a guy who got thrown out of the game I want to

00:04:25.21 say or maybe he disagreed with I think it was he disagreed with what was called

00:04:29.14 a strike and then the coach started fighting with the umpire and the player

00:04:34.03 walked out of the field went down grabbed the garbage can and then placed

00:04:38.17 it behind the plate and pointed at the umpire and said that's you you're

00:04:42.04 garbage so there has been a garbage can on the field I've never seen a vacuum on

00:04:46.18 the field you sent a clip to the group chat the other day about it was a

00:04:51.20 American football game where a guy kicked the football but apparently it

00:04:55.10 somehow never happened before well no I didn't I didn't send the I feel like

00:04:58.23 this is just you being Erickson you're getting confused I said I sent a clip of

00:05:02.20 a guy getting hit in the head with a football after a kick and then there was

00:05:06.00 another kick discussion later that I don't think was a video I thought Eric put

00:05:10.16 something in the slack what are we yeah we're talking about the Doug flu tie

00:05:14.10 dropkick is what we're talking about I assume

00:05:16.12 Gavin didn't understand why that was first of all he's a throwing man Gavin

00:05:20.19 he's not a kicking man his job is to throw he's a quarterback making

00:05:24.15 it's the first time anyone had dropped the ball bounced it off the floor and

00:05:28.13 kicked it over the yeah and it was it was in the modern nfl it literally was

00:05:33.06 it's just not a thing that kick people do why would you why would you drop the

00:05:36.17 ball and kick it like especially if you're a quarterback nobody's prepared

00:05:40.08 for that quarterbacks don't take the ball what was their way of doing like they

00:05:43.22 thought the other team thought they were gonna like run with it but then he

00:05:47.11 kicked it yeah I think the other team assumed because I think it was they

00:05:51.01 positioned like they were going for two I'm not fully aware I'm just assuming

00:05:54.09 and instead of actually running and like throwing the ball to score it they

00:05:58.15 scored off of a drop kick which if you drop the ball down bounce and kick it

00:06:02.22 between the uprights that's a point so I think like nobody was prepared for the

00:06:06.22 play because it's both a qb and they're in a position in which they would

00:06:10.08 typically go for two but they ran a play that would score one but sometimes like

00:06:15.02 if it's fourth down they just kick it yeah but it's first the kicker does it

00:06:19.16 it's the kicker's job and they don't kick it that way they have like a guy

00:06:23.11 that catches it and holds it and places it and then the kicker just kicks it off

00:06:27.03 the ground from the guy that's holding it the kicker never sing it off the

00:06:30.14 ground I think it is I think there's room for air if you're trying to

00:06:33.15 purposely bounce the ball and kick it yourself I feel like that's way harder

00:06:37.19 yeah for sure I mean it's not it's a football it's not a sphere man you don't

00:06:40.18 you can't predict how exactly how it's going to bounce please

00:06:43.17 has got to be out Gavin according to your favorite movie of all time lace is

00:06:49.03 out place out laces out also it's just like a human tripod

00:06:52.13 essentially is is the other guy's job why would you remove the tripod this

00:06:56.12 stabilizes it for you nice and easy shape of the ball

00:06:59.19 they also it's like a different sports I don't know the rugby comparison

00:07:03.11 I think the balls are shaped differently too the hangover Andrew what about the

00:07:07.13 hangover it was a good trailer and it was a terrible movie I liked the trailer

00:07:11.03 a lot I thought it was gonna be funny and then I didn't like the movie at all

00:07:14.03 really like you would say you hated the hangover oh yeah I I don't understand

00:07:18.09 the I don't I don't understand why people like that film I think the first

00:07:21.21 one's quite good yeah I enjoy the first remember yeah

00:07:25.07 I haven't watched it since it came out I don't have really like any interest in

00:07:29.00 revisiting it but I got an argument with Brandon farmahini one time

00:07:32.18 who told me at work who told me that it was the funniest movie in like the last

00:07:36.17 decade and was so full of jokes he didn't understand how I could not like

00:07:39.22 it so I asked him tell me your favorite joke from the

00:07:42.15 movie and he just looked at me for about five minutes and then said oh and then

00:07:45.20 walked away well yeah I think that's a terrible call to call it a joke like

00:07:49.20 when I think of I agree with something like naked gun I think of

00:07:53.19 like those kind of like that where the joke per minute is absurd

00:07:57.21 the hangover is like and I was kind of [ __ ] because it's a

00:08:02.13 little bit of a mystery it's a comedy it

00:08:05.09 kind of brought mike Tyson back in a way I will say there's a moment in the

00:08:09.09 trailer that is funnier edited than it was in the movie and that was the the

00:08:12.15 mike Tyson uh Phil Collins bit yes where in the in the trailer it's like doo doo

00:08:17.02 doo doo and then he sucks him at the end of that but uh in the movie it's not as

00:08:21.05 funny I could you know what I think the worst

00:08:23.19 part of the hangover was for me and this is like a very strange complaint they

00:08:28.01 put out back on the 360 when random movies would come out that were big they

00:08:32.18 would put out profile picture packs where it was just faces of the

00:08:36.14 characters typically and there are people so many people use the baby

00:08:40.15 there's a baby from the hangover as one of them and the people that did it

00:08:43.22 thought they were really funny and I was just sick of it it was a popular gamer

00:08:48.02 picture for a stretch of time the baby with the glasses

00:08:50.16 you're just Danny devito yours is dan davito what was for what

00:08:55.16 what movie was he no yours was oh yeah but I pulled that

00:08:59.12 that was a choice I made that was that was a custom pull yeah I'm not hating

00:09:04.15 necessarily on anyone that does that it's just there was a I don't know uh uh

00:09:09.10 what's the word I'm looking for like a belief of com I don't know I just don't

00:09:13.14 if you I'm fine with you liking the hangover

00:09:16.00 liking the hangover to the point where it's your gamer picture is is a step too

00:09:20.19 far or we talked about it briefly when we're playing halo but my

00:09:25.12 most excited I was from a trailer to the least impressed I was with a movie was

00:09:31.02 the tuxedo with Jackie chan it's such a remember I was a teenager

00:09:36.10 I was really I loved rush hour I was getting into like oh like who am I

00:09:41.14 rumble in the Bronx like all of his early American type stuff

00:09:45.16 tuxedo came out I thought as a teenager

00:09:49.16 I thought oh [ __ ] I was so excited I and

00:09:52.02 I didn't see it at the cinema I bought it on dvd I was like I've wasted my

00:09:56.08 money on it wait did you purposely not I didn't know that

00:10:00.10 you didn't did you not see it in theaters because you're like I'm gonna

00:10:03.22 love this movie so much I'm going to want to watch it multiple times I'm

00:10:07.09 going to save my money and buy it then why did you get to I just didn't get to

00:10:11.01 go that much when I was a kid it's like okay it's like a big event when I went

00:10:14.13 so I assumed at the time I was busy seeing like lord of the rings and stuff

00:10:18.08 to make it count but it was like not even a rental scenario you're like I

00:10:21.14 know I'm going to love this I would like I knew it teachers

00:10:25.19 it was probably like 15 quid on dvd my reaction waste was the same as yours

00:10:30.21 I don't know Gavin genuinely may have been the biggest like

00:10:35.03 tuxedo fan based on trailer on the plant I don't think anyone may have

00:10:38.13 anticipated that movie more than Gavin it's such a weird movie to be excited

00:10:42.12 about I don't think Jackie chan was bad in that either I think it was just not

00:10:46.01 any good I feel like I very rarely would say that Jackie chan was the problem of

00:10:50.07 the thing that he was in I agree with that like I I can't think

00:10:53.22 of a like wow Jackie chan really [ __ ]

00:10:56.00 that movie when did Jackie chan ever phone it in

00:10:59.05 right I don't think so yeah no I think it's a consummate professional that

00:11:03.09 Jackie chan is the Gavin free of movies he's the podcasting gathering

00:11:08.05 I'll say it because we all know it's true he's the

00:11:11.11 ty the creme de la creme he is the he's the one that we all aspire to be as soon

00:11:15.23 as Gavin told me that I immediately went and watched the trailer for the tuxedo

00:11:20.21 and watching it in the context of a match and Gavin watching it for the

00:11:24.19 first time be like holy [ __ ] this looks good was very funny they killed James

00:11:30.00 brown for those that never seen it I think the plot with of the movie was

00:11:35.20 that he gets Jackie chan powers but from a suit and I think I remember that

00:11:39.13 there's water that makes people thirsty and that's all I can remember from that

00:11:43.16 film so it's a James bond movie but not a James bond movie there's a guy that is

00:11:48.11 like James bond and he's British but it turns out that all of his abilities come

00:11:52.17 from his suit Jackie chan is a taxi driver

00:11:56.12 that befriends this guy I also haven't seen this movie in a long time so this

00:11:59.13 could be completely wrong but I think he befriends the guy

00:12:03.20 and then somehow ends up with the suit because the guy dies

00:12:06.15 uh and then he kills James brown and then Jackie chan kills names James

00:12:09.20 around and they do a dance number because he has to perform instead of

00:12:13.17 James brown because the suit has a bunch of abilities to it it's like a stealth

00:12:17.17 suit but it also has like funky mode I feel like is what they display so he can

00:12:21.13 like dance and perform I'll go be honest with you right now I haven't seen the

00:12:24.21 movie since like the early 2000s the way you're describing it I really want to

00:12:29.14 watch the movie it sounds awesome I sounds really good

00:12:32.21 I went to watch it I refused to pay five dollars to write it

00:12:37.09 I was gonna do that last night and I was like 4.99 I can't do it it was three

00:12:41.07 dollars I'd do it but five dollars why don't we have a watch along we do watch

00:12:45.17 long I'd watch in that context I just I forgot James brown was in it and that

00:12:49.21 they weirdly kill James brown and then I wanted to go because in the trailer it

00:12:53.12 happens it's like no way they actually do that it's an unfortunate thing where

00:12:58.15 you go to the movie wiki and whoever wrote the plot synopsis deemed that

00:13:02.01 scene not worth explaining there is no mention to James brown in the movie wiki

00:13:06.01 for that thing so if somebody if somebody watches the tuxedo feel free to

00:13:09.22 please include the James brown section of that film from the wiki because he's

00:13:13.12 listed in the cast but there is no mention him in the plot breakdown of the

00:13:19.07 tuxedo it's a dumb movie he made a lot of those movies like the

00:13:23.20 do you remember the medallion that was one of those Jackie chan era

00:13:27.11 not very good American I know I've seen it I couldn't tell you

00:13:31.06 anything about it I don't think I've seen that one Eric just said we're a

00:13:35.04 Jackie chan podcast I'm okay with that Jackie chan some great movies rush hour

00:13:40.23 the Jackie chan adventures mr nice guy I would argue

00:13:44.16 the greatest blooper reel of all time rush hour 2 I think that's probably the

00:13:48.22 greatest post-credit blooper reel in movie history where Chris rock uh no

00:13:53.01 Chris rock damn it where Chris tucker looks out the window and says

00:13:57.11 damn he ain't gonna be in rush hour three I think that might be the funniest

00:14:01.11 post like blooper line of all time I remember that killing that may have been

00:14:05.02 the biggest laugh in the theater and that was a well received movie I

00:14:09.16 remember as a child watching that in a pack theater and that line killing and

00:14:13.18 myself included just like is great line very funny blooper

00:14:17.11 they don't do those anymore I feel like I was the last time you saw a blooper

00:14:20.18 reel I think they're in all of Jackie chan's films I well I think they're

00:14:24.07 staple I literally I watched the tuxedos blooper reel last night on YouTube I

00:14:27.16 didn't watch the movie but I at least watched that you have to watch a Jackie

00:14:31.14 chan blooper Geoff I was waiting for the subject to change away from Jackie chad

00:14:37.01 I I I I'm I'm not up to date on my Jackie chan content so I was just

00:14:40.13 letting you guys go I don't know don't throw to me I I had nothing to do

00:14:44.07 with that that's you you guys are having the Jackie chan discussion I couldn't

00:14:48.00 name a Jackie chan movie post uh the one he did with jet li whatever

00:14:52.06 that was called what about the foreigner I never saw that I thought that looked

00:14:57.09 interesting directed by the guy that made golden eye starring pierce brosnan

00:15:02.04 and Jackie chan I've never seen it but I haven't it looked dark it was like this

00:15:06.18 is gritty Jackie chan his family I think

00:15:08.20 dies in a bombing and then he's like I'm gonna get revenge I wonder if there's a

00:15:12.08 blooper reel on that one there can't be a blooper reel on the foreigner there's

00:15:17.02 no way oh that would be awesome I don't know I don't think pierce brosnan plays

00:15:22.08 like a spy type character I think he's just like an executive who's a villain

00:15:27.18 but I could be wrong haven't seen it nice Eric did you see no way out Gavin

00:15:32.21 what was that have you seen no way out or have you seen no way out Geoff uh the

00:15:38.12 movie with Bridget Fonda the remake of uh left nikita no well no I don't think

00:15:44.02 so maybe it's an Owen Wilson movie that came out in like 2016. No way out Kevin

00:15:49.05 costner Sean young no that's not am no escape that's what I mean no escape

00:15:56.06 not no way out no escape I knew noah's in the title it's just pierce brosnan

00:16:02.05 plays bond again it's like his last I'd say roll his bond

00:16:06.00 he can't flat out say he's bond but it's

00:16:08.22 like they constantly tease the fact that he's like an older burnt out bond like

00:16:14.04 Sean Connery and the rock yes exactly like Sean Connery in the rock

00:16:19.05 same type of same type of deal do you know

00:16:21.11 this is going to be a really weird abs like just a random question Geoff do you

00:16:24.23 what's your favorite mission possible movie let's set it up that way first oh

00:16:29.03 well that's easy that's not even a question

00:16:32.12 real question possible three mission possibilities ever made thank you this

00:16:36.11 is one of the best mission it is not a movie it's a film mission impossible you

00:16:40.13 can't call mission impossible three a movie because it's that it's it that

00:16:44.06 would be it's an insult to what that that piece of art is it is a film in

00:16:49.12 every way who is the girl at the beginning it's Carrie Russell

00:16:53.13 are you just dropping trivia are you testing him to confirm that he is possible

00:16:58.23 that question is how Geoff lost his car really it's like I own his car

00:17:04.07 oh that was the bet I got there was a carry wrestle wow

00:17:08.09 I don't remember who I thought it was but I I didn't think it was Carrie

00:17:11.22 Russell didn't you think it was like Anne hat ha way or something and I was

00:17:15.04 like no it was somebody that made sense but it wasn't cure it wasn't I can't

00:17:20.01 remember who it was uh Michelle did you mistake Michelle monahan because she's

00:17:24.08 in that as well and I feel like I could kind of play that no no we don't I

00:17:29.04 it doesn't matter you'll never know the important thing is that I know that I

00:17:33.06 haven't owned my car in 15 years why why why why do you ask by the way

00:17:38.01 why do you ask well I'm glad you uh this

00:17:40.03 is a conversation we had I agree mission possible three is the best one by far

00:17:44.05 and I think it's largely due to the performance of Philip schumer-Hoffman I

00:17:49.14 think one of the great movie villains in that and that menacing is [ __ ]

00:17:53.06 he's awesome in it there are three perfect moments in that film if you'd

00:17:57.09 like I can go through them with you uh the first perfect moment in that film is

00:18:02.10 when they're breaking into the Vatican and uh uh

00:18:06.03 ving rhames and uh Ethan hunt have the conversation where he goes what's up

00:18:09.22 with you and fingerings goes nothing what's up with you he goes nothing

00:18:14.00 that's it's just perfectly acted there's

00:18:15.23 the scene when he's infiltrating the big building I think it's in India and

00:18:19.01 they're like talking about the plan and then it just cuts to him the outside of

00:18:22.08 the building and it comes to him screaming I'm not gonna make the

00:18:25.18 extraction and he jumps out a window and you have no idea what happened in that

00:18:28.19 building but it went very [ __ ] wrong that was an awesome scene and then at

00:18:32.12 the end when he's with the the chick and

00:18:35.01 he's like if you don't kill me I'm going to die that's a great moment too all

00:18:38.23 perfect moments from a perfect film it's great it starts as I think one of the

00:18:42.10 great film intros as well you don't know what's going on this character normally

00:18:45.17 in power is in a bad spot it doesn't look like Carrie Russell apparently it is.

00:18:51.07 [Laughter]

00:18:53.05 Do you remember Philip Seymour hoffman's character's name a mission impossible

00:18:58.15 three uh no for like how iconic that character is

00:19:02.10 in my mind of like a great villain very forgettable his name is Owen I think

00:19:07.08 it's the least menacing name to menacing character and in film history possibly

00:19:12.15 there's nothing memorable or evil about the name Owen this is so not

00:19:16.23 intimidating yeah the rabbit's foot that's right nick

00:19:20.03 that is that's the whole thing of the what is it like an atomic bomb or

00:19:24.12 something the rabbit's foot he's pursuing

00:19:26.21 I don't really remember what the rabbit was it was I don't know that we ever

00:19:31.00 yeah I don't know that we found out did we well I said that it was wasn't it a

00:19:34.19 thing that wrong there was this insane shot where uh dr Manhattan dies and he

00:19:39.05 drops the briefcase and the thing rolls out like perfectly into the camera in

00:19:43.12 focus and it was like wow how did they do that you mean billy crudup

00:19:47.16 yeah okay I assume that's who he means yeah was he not dr Manhattan no he was I

00:19:52.05 think he was I just couldn't remember I just couldn't remember you want to bet a

00:19:55.11 car on it no no I bet Geoff's car my mission impossible betting days are

00:20:00.04 over still paying off the last one I wanna how are you doing Geoff because the

00:20:04.12 last time we recorded this you were you're in a bad spot you're you're I was

00:20:08.21 at 36

00:20:10.19 in the first recording I got up to about 42

00:20:14.00 by the second recording you're like half of where I was in chocolate yeah yeah

00:20:20.02 uh I'm okay thanks for asking um you know I had the colonoscopy it was a

00:20:24.20 nightmare uh I do have a story to share with you at some point and I'll uh I'll

00:20:30.10 tease it uh there's a pastrami plot twist in my life oh no oh no did they

00:20:35.11 find some pastrami up your ass well uh but uh but we don't have to get

00:20:40.08 into that right now if you guys want to talk about movies or whatever what's

00:20:44.19 your favorite mission impossible movie Andrew what's your

00:20:48.11 what's your secret second favorite uh this is gonna be like a really weird

00:20:53.07 qualifier I think the second best mission impossible movie is the first

00:20:56.23 act of mission impossible one up until he sprints out of the

00:21:00.15 restaurant I think that is like the greatest sequence of of any mission

00:21:04.14 impossible but that's before he's hanging from the wire in the room with

00:21:08.06 the pressure floor yeah I don't really care about it like that that seems fine

00:21:12.05 but like it's like iconic it is an iconic scene but the movie

00:21:16.08 really loses me from the point he sprints out of the restaurant I think

00:21:20.04 everything to that point is like pretty intense and enjoyable and there is after

00:21:24.10 he's blown up the fish tank with the gun yeah literally as soon as as soon as he

00:21:28.12 sprints out after blowing up the fish tank with the gum that movie takes a

00:21:32.14 nosedive for me [Laughter]

00:21:34.15 it drops now dramatically after that I would say uh

00:21:39.01 what is the the second the last one that came out

00:21:42.13 which one was that Luke nation rogue nation was pretty good no I enjoyed that

00:21:47.14 one no wait yeah don't know what it has posted the apple dumpling

00:21:52.15 game a Disney movie called the apple dumpling gang I was just on the dinner

00:21:58.12 for later I was just thinking about my favorite movies as a kid the other day

00:22:03.02 and I was thinking about how many don knotts movies I used to watch when I was

00:22:06.20 a kid and the apple dumpling gang and the apple dumpling gang rides again were

00:22:10.14 two of my favorite movies as a kid and I I looked up the the poster and I was

00:22:15.02 like oh [ __ ] that's kind of funny because we're out we we're an apple

00:22:18.14 podcast now yeah there's the one if we should make an apple scrumpling

00:22:23.03 gang poster but probably not we're probably hitting the apple concept

00:22:26.22 is there scrumping in the app is the apple dumpling gang pro scrump or is

00:22:30.15 there any I think those dudes steal those kids if

00:22:34.07 I remember correctly they steal the kids I thought maybe I think the kids are

00:22:38.23 orphans or something and they're like okay level criminals and they all end up

00:22:42.17 in a career I don't know why I I assumed the

00:22:45.11 children were the apple dumpling gang and not the two guys in the background I

00:22:51.03 think I have completely misread who the gang was

00:22:54.07 because two people are in a gang no you need at least six for a gang I

00:22:58.17 would say I think you need at least three three no

00:23:02.04 three's too little the apple dumpling gang rides again ain't no kids in that

00:23:06.15 photo you can't all fit in a taxi to be a gang your gang can't fit in one cab

00:23:13.01 that's the clock I think that's the qualifier we have to

00:23:18.02 order two caps is the qualifier once you have to have two cabs or maybe

00:23:23.10 a larger vehicle if you need a custom large vehicle you've entered gang

00:23:28.06 territory if you need an uber xl

00:23:30.23 okay uh here so I had to look it up what qualifies a gang

00:23:36.13 gangs are associations of three or more individuals who adopt identity so it's

00:23:42.13 got to be wow so okay gang bang fortunate I don't

00:23:47.07 I mean if those three people could identify as a gang and they're all

00:23:51.08 banging then yes well yeah I guess they need to identify as a gang

00:23:56.02 that means technically you could film a gang bang in one cab

00:23:59.15 you could you're right I I disagree with all these qualifiers I don't three is

00:24:04.12 not enough to be a gang it's a it's a regulation gang of three so so we could

00:24:09.20 we could be the apple scrumpling gang there's enough of us there's five of us

00:24:13.05 here are we doing that are we doing the boys of dumpty like we gotta get well

00:24:18.03 the boys are the boys of dumpty [Music]

00:24:21.21 right it's gang city over here [Applause]

00:24:27.05 we all know that going online without expressvpn is like using our smart phone

00:24:32.10 without a protective case most of the time you're probably gonna be fine

00:24:37.07 but all it takes is one accident will drop their butterfingers onto solid

00:24:42.04 concrete and suddenly you wish you'd protected yourself that's why in my own

00:24:47.14 words everyone needs a vpn because when you encrypt to an unencrypted network in

00:24:53.05 a cafe or a hotel or an airport your online data is super not secure and any

00:24:59.11 hacker on the same network can gain access to and steal your personal data

00:25:04.07 and we all saw those hacker movies in the 90s we know how it works Sandra

00:25:07.18 bullock's not going to be there to save us in the real world and it doesn't take

00:25:12.19 much technical knowledge to be one of those evil

00:25:16.15 dude hackers it only takes some malfeasance and apparently any smart 12

00:25:20.14 year old could do it also your dad is valuable did you know that hackers make

00:25:25.03 up to like a thousand dollars a person selling your lame boring personal info

00:25:30.17 on the dark web that's why in my own words you should use expressvpn the

00:25:36.13 encrypted tunnel it's super secure it's easy to use and it works on all devices

00:25:42.02 that's like phones laptops tablets etc etc you get the idea it's secure it's

00:25:47.08 encrypted and it will protect your data so that hackers can't steal it that's

00:25:52.21 why I think you should use expressvpn so secure your online data today by

00:25:58.13 visiting expressvpn.com face that is e-x-p-r-e-s-s-v-p

00:26:02.13 in dot-com face nailed it and you can get an extra three months free

00:26:14.04 keeps giving something more memorable than a gift card or a pair of socks

00:26:20.06 although I'm not one of those people that hates socks as gifts I think socks

00:26:24.13 are perfectly acceptable as gifts big sock fan but we're not talking about

00:26:28.11 socks we're talking about a gift that's way cooler than socks a gift that's more

00:26:33.09 useful than socks a gift that's going to last longer than a pair of socks we are

00:28:06.13 yeah he's been sucking on this 100

00:28:09.15 chocolate for fun he's all [ __ ] into it now he sends update photos constantly

00:28:14.22 I I found out a way to enjoy it where it you don't have to just eat it in 10

00:28:20.00 minutes you can sit down and have it with

00:28:23.02 something and and find pleasure in the pain but why why did you go for this

00:28:28.01 just in your free time without telling I had I had the chocolate from face jam

00:28:34.02 and everyone I got jealous because everyone did

00:28:36.20 uh chocolate eating and it seemed like uh something I didn't want to do but

00:28:40.21 seemed like a fun thing so I went you know what I'm gonna try this uh and I

00:28:45.00 did I had that chocolate sitting in there and just wrote in Google what can

00:28:49.00 I do with 100 chocolate and that was one of the things was have it with a black

00:28:53.05 cup of coffee that you enjoy and I will say I've done it twice now with my mouth

00:28:56.15 is watering thinking about it I enjoyed it so much uh really how many let me ask

00:29:01.01 you a question how many so like you had a cup of coffee

00:29:04.14 black coffee you enjoy very much and then how many squares of the

00:29:09.09 chocolate did you have with that probably two and a half three tops

00:29:14.14 okay throughout the like slowly slowly throughout the course of the coffee okay

00:29:19.04 I found the best method was putting a little bit of dark chocolate on my

00:29:22.18 tongue and then taking a drink of coffee and like letting it melt the chocolate

00:29:26.10 because then I got a lot of the floral flavor I'm a coffee guy the the way that

00:29:31.22 Andrew is many different types of guy I am a coffee guy and I so do you grind

00:29:35.12 your coffee at home by hand yeah like I have like a hand grinder I have

00:29:39.08 like a I have like a hand grinder I like that a lot

00:29:42.09 my I would love to be a coffee guy because the prep and the ritual of it

00:29:46.05 seems like a lot of fun but I feel like I would probably be able to smell smells

00:29:49.18 so good it's very easy the smell would be great yeah it seems like it would be

00:29:55.05 meditative I love that if I could just do that and then not drink it I would be

00:29:59.06 a coffee guy my wife is the same way if I smell coffee early in the morning it

00:30:03.21 changes the course of my day it makes me want to [ __ ] like it it just puts me

00:30:08.21 good mood instantly it does coffee makes you [ __ ] no no I know but

00:30:13.18 but smell but smell the smell specifically

00:30:17.03 Geoff's the one who got me into coffee and it's I was amazed at what it did to

00:30:20.08 my body but I've had so much coffee now that just a whiff of it gets me in the

00:30:25.07 mood for a nice morning poo it's like you've have love dog your ass with your

00:30:30.10 scent like you're trained you've loved your ass be the title of the episode yep

00:30:36.15 absolutely uh uh the the kings coast coffee achieve

00:30:40.17 line that we had for a while was very good that was an excellent cup of coffee

00:30:45.13 I prefer like a light roast but I I really found a lot of enjoyment in that

00:30:50.12 very chocolatey cup it was very so you're straight in 100

00:30:53.10 chocolate yeah yeah my progress is I've done 70 I've done 78 I'm currently

00:30:59.05 working my way through the 85

00:31:02.15 bar as I develop my palette over the uh the q4 of this year

00:31:06.01 so Eric real fast because I also love that achieve blind I actually just uh

00:31:10.22 and not just because you know the the the reference no no is

00:31:15.08 it good it was a cup of coffee yeah so I

00:31:17.15 subscribed to it on the website so I get it like every three weeks uh or every

00:31:21.21 two weeks I get a new a new bag of it uh so recently they just sent me a bag and

00:31:26.03 on the label it said hey this used to be called achieve but we're gonna rebrand

00:31:29.14 it don't worry we'll keep sending it to you it's just gonna be called something

00:31:33.11 else so it's still out there if you want it yeah

00:31:36.02 do you know which one it is I that's the

00:31:37.22 most recent one I've got so as soon as I

00:31:40.00 get the new badge let me batch in with a name I'll tell you what it is but you

00:31:43.10 can still get that coffee that's very funny I think it's all I dreamt yeah I

00:31:47.20 love it huh good very nice I like it so gav you were saying what are you up

00:31:53.10 to 85 and you enjoy 85. I I 85 to me is still edible as just chocolate on its

00:31:58.20 own it's get it's getting up there I do want to say I don't want anyone to get

00:32:03.01 confused about the situation that I'm in with the dark chocolate I've enjoyed it

00:32:07.02 with a cup of coffee because it changes the flavor it's like smoking a cigar and

00:32:11.01 having port wine it's nice it changes the flavor or whatever I despise dark

00:32:15.14 chocolate I think it is the worst thing you can do with chocolate I think it is

00:32:21.12 an affront to sweets I think it's pathetic that it's being pressed into

00:32:25.10 actual candy and being sold in stores I I if it went away tomorrow our lives

00:32:30.10 would be better for it that is how I feel about dark chocolate

00:32:35.03 oh that's good you know what Eric can I can I say uh I tend I try not

00:32:39.04 to have definitive chocolate opinions because it's such a polarizing world we

00:32:42.23 live in but I'm gonna back you up on this I'm right there with you I listen

00:32:46.12 and do you say that I couldn't I it was like my heart was swelling up with pride

00:32:50.05 because I feel the same way about you and so I'm I you have my back I'm right

00:32:55.09 there with you I think it should be erratically feel the same way about me

00:32:59.09 you think Eric sucks and if he went away I feel the same way about about dark

00:33:04.06 chocolate as you do oh you feel the same way as me not yeah

00:33:09.03 about me as if I were the dark chocolate and you want me to go away

00:33:13.12 no no you can stay because I like your opinions

00:33:16.08 definitely what that sounded like it was one you picked the one word that

00:33:21.10 would change your statement into an insult instead of the compliment of your

00:33:27.07 support that you intended I felt so good and then I felt so bad

00:33:30.12 and I mean that so it's a 1518 years of this kind it's hard to it's hard to to

00:33:35.04 not insult those what's interesting on the chocolates is as the cocoa content

00:33:40.02 goes up watching the serving size get bigger I assume as real sugar starts

00:33:44.14 leaving the ingredients it's like one serving is two squares and then it's

00:33:48.09 like one serving it's two and a half now one serving is three until eventually

00:33:52.07 the entire bar is one served huh now do you are you worried how do you

00:33:57.01 feel about milk chocolate because I would be kind of okay but if

00:34:00.08 you think as you progress down this dark chocolate road developing your palate

00:34:04.23 will your willingness to have milk chocolate lessen well I'm hoping it's

00:34:10.02 it's additive to my palette I hope it's not ruining other areas of my past

00:34:14.07 I would assume that it would replace that you would like no longer be able to

00:34:18.03 enjoy what you previously did not that this is an expansion

00:34:22.00 when someone says that's an acquired taste do you have to misplace a taste to

00:34:25.23 make room for it I don't think so no but

00:34:28.13 I don't think those are the same thing I feel as though you are training your

00:34:32.05 palate to be able to prefer like ideally by the end of this your your chocolate

00:34:37.18 of choice will be the 100 percent correct like you will we could hope so

00:34:41.07 yeah so at that point I feel like you couldn't be further away from milk it's

00:34:45.06 the farthest you could be from milk chocolate and I would be worried that

00:34:49.22 you would no longer be able to go back to milk and I feel like your ability to

00:34:54.11 get 100 dark chocolate in the wild would be low I feel like it's tougher you're

00:34:59.11 narrowing your ability to get chocolate here's what I think lin are missing a

00:35:03.12 trick right they they should have an excellent

00:35:07.11 training bar where each square is new percentages until it is the entire

00:35:12.12 package what about like an advent calendar for your palate

00:35:17.05 like every day it starts at like 76 and on Christmas day

00:35:23.11 it doesn't even yeah it doesn't need to even be a Christmas thing just like a

00:35:28.13 daily hey this is where you should be we're at 76.7 today maybe

00:35:33.00 face or uniform could collaborate with lint chocolate and we can get that going

00:35:38.08 oh by the way how hot is that uniform logo we're working on

00:35:42.00 looks nice it does look I'm digging it I'm really into it it would look good on

00:35:45.13 some chocolate I'll tell you that right now

00:35:47.20 can we did you see it you could see it could you see it can you see it like

00:35:52.02 debossed into a chocolate bar the uniform it looks so sweet yeah I can't

00:35:55.20 wait for us to make a chocolate and then Gavin complained that it's milk when

00:35:59.17 it's dark just be completely wrong about what the actual contents of the

00:36:05.03 chocolate are are you referring to the sign

00:36:07.23 yes I am I think a comment leaver left a comment saying that what is this

00:36:11.14 [ __ ] plastic sign I still don't actually have the damn thing so I assumed

00:36:16.03 that they were right about it being made of plastic but Eric said it's it's

00:36:20.06 metal yes Eric this is why you can't listen to comet levers I don't know why

00:36:24.06 I was listening I got one in my hand right now it is

00:36:26.18 definitely metal well that's awesome it's not as [ __ ] as I thought

00:36:30.14 when did you get the sign uh it mine came in the mail mine came in

00:36:35.07 the mail the day we had that conversation okay

00:36:37.22 I just didn't open it up till later in the day I'm hoping I get I've bought

00:36:42.00 every single piece of our merch and then they've sent it to me anyway and uh so

00:36:46.16 I've had double everything double waffle freshener why do you buy them okay well

00:36:51.05 it's part of the support in the show at the very least it's all limited runs

00:36:55.07 you're just taking one away from a a comment leave it you're gonna make this

00:36:58.21 the show why don't you have to support the show you make yes you support it by

00:37:03.23 making it you also frequently go into the merch channel and get them to make

00:37:08.03 stuff you start some of this stuff and then you buy it well I was okay well I

00:37:12.17 you know what's funny is I I think I was told I could be wrong I was told I

00:37:16.01 couldn't get a gurple shirt at the time because of like the process it was made

00:37:20.02 and I was it's one of those it one of those shirts but

00:37:23.12 regardless of that I don't mind I buy the product for the show I make the show

00:37:27.09 I'm happy with the show support it in that way I feel like I'm kind of paying

00:37:31.06 myself in a weird way I don't mind ordering the things but the scrump signs

00:37:34.20 the first one I didn't order and I haven't got a scrub sign yet so I think

00:37:38.08 I may have just missed out I think that's that was the cut off the one I

00:37:41.12 didn't I'll tell you what you can have my scrumps on buddy I'll give it to you

00:37:52.00 different word to regardless what do you mean well you said irregardless um

00:37:57.06 what do you what do you what's your question here is irregardless not a word

00:38:01.03 well regardless of the word I would have said regardless it's the same word

00:38:06.00 irregardless and regardless are used interchangeably

00:38:09.00 if you reply to an email you could say irregarding no I think you have to say I

00:38:13.18 think irregardless is the word I feel like I didn't invent the word I feel

00:38:18.06 like that no you didn't it's in the [ __ ] dictionary dude

00:38:22.04 they're saying it's not a word or it's the same word irregardless

00:38:25.11 dictionary.com irregardless adverb non-standard regardless the photographer

00:38:30.10 always says irregardless of how his subjects are feeling smile uh frequently

00:38:34.15 asked questions is irregardless a word yes it may not be a word you like or a

00:38:38.11 word you can use in a term paper but irregardless certainly is a word

00:38:43.09 so there we go the same thing as regardless yes it does look at you

00:38:46.23 [ __ ] guys coming at me from my ear regardless you said don't you don't you

00:38:50.09 guys I'm right there with you buddy I'm on the side of your regardless well I

00:39:16.12 I'm playing through the Sherlock Holmes game right now and whenever they say it

00:39:21.20 that's how it's spelt and it's disgusting it makes me sick

00:39:26.12 well I spell jail now hot take well no I I don't know if it is because they it's

00:39:32.05 spelled the way I don't know maybe they're doing it like within the

00:39:36.13 timeline of that game because it's set in the past but

00:39:39.05 every time I see it we have given [ __ ]

00:39:41.03 to uh judgment smelling the u.s spelling of

00:39:44.11 judgment also terrible but the Europe [ __ ] up jail that's a horrendous way

00:39:48.21 to spell judgment judgement awful terrible sounding so if you're going to

00:39:56.10 come at me for irregardless I'll I'll bring up James I was okay we're not I

00:40:14.23 replying in text you can't read tone and text

00:40:18.13 talk about what Geoff texted us the other day

00:40:20.12 what did Geoff text us the other day well it started with a picture of an

00:40:25.14 apple man did I just miss did I miss these texts

00:40:29.09 I think he probably did buddy what were they were texts they were text so your

00:40:34.04 phone was probably off if we weren't if it wasn't during the recording you

00:40:38.00 probably didn't get it shall I read out what you text us

00:40:42.08 yeah you can read it out and then I'll we'll get into that story if you want

00:40:48.21 yeah I'd love to uh so Friday 1241 pm Geoff just sent

00:40:52.07 a picture of a van with apples on the back and he wrote

00:40:56.11 oh yes so it's so apples [Laughter]

00:41:00.00 Eric then said colonoscopy went well then Geoff said there and a van of apples

00:41:08.02 it's a hot day I saw so many people at a redressing restraint eat place

00:41:16.08 Eric said this rules Geoff said Emily said stop I'm being

00:41:20.17 really quiet she's on the phone Eric said who is she talking to do they

00:41:27.07 know about the boys of zimmer Geoff said it's pastrami people

00:41:39.05 okay well I'll say this there's an accompanying video of that

00:41:45.05 moment that I was not aware first off I don't remember any of that I don't

00:41:50.01 remember texting that stuff I saw the video I don't remember being in the

00:41:54.23 video he's like a seven-year-old this was all right

00:41:59.11 right after my colonoscopy and I was drugged the [ __ ] up on propofol or

00:42:04.21 propofil or whatever it's called okay so we'll get into the pastrami plot twist

00:42:10.15 so I I was with you guys last week you know I was uh 36 then I was up to like

00:42:16.07 42 or whatever uh it was I'll say this this is my second colonoscopy first one

00:42:20.20 I was about gavin's age when I did it it was sucked but I it wasn't the end of

00:42:26.12 the world I bounced back you know it wasn't a big deal this one [ __ ]

00:42:31.07 just wrecked me doing the the special diet and then like

00:42:35.04 not eating for three days and then uh doing all the solutions and stuff it was

00:42:39.17 rough I had a really hard time with it and I guess it's just age [ __ ] right

00:42:43.11 because I'd done it before when I was younger and it was fine so then we go in

00:42:47.03 we the plan is you go in you do the colonoscopy

00:42:50.04 uh they knock you out they shove cameras up your [ __ ] they take pictures you

00:42:55.14 come back they wake you up then the cool thing is they're like you can have

00:42:59.12 whatever you want to drink we've got it all

00:43:01.09 and uh and then you can eat whatever you want because it's not one of those

00:43:04.17 things where you like have to come out of it slowly or whatever they're like no

00:43:08.12 gorgeous engorge yourself on whatever you want so I had a whole game plan when

00:43:11.12 we got in there we had we had it set up Emily was gonna order the sandwich the p

00:43:15.12 word sandwich and I was gonna it was gonna be my first meal back after the

00:43:19.03 call after a successful colonoscopy uh then we get in there I'm in the waiting

00:43:22.08 room you know they're taking blood doing all the stuff I'm in the gown sitting

00:43:25.13 there joking around and the lady says what do you want to drink when you come

00:43:29.07 out and I go what are my options she goes we got it all we got fruit juice we

00:43:33.01 got water we got sodas we gotta go do you have diet soda and she goes we have

00:43:36.19 diet coke and I was like can I have a diet coke right after the colonoscopy

00:43:40.19 and she was like you certainly can I let me recommend not having a diet

00:43:45.16 code right after cold uh I didn't realize the problem with

00:43:49.00 that until later but so I go through have a perfectly normal colonoscopy I

00:43:52.16 assume uh I don't remember any of it I was asleep I do remember drinking a

00:43:58.00 bunch of diet coke immediately after and then some hours later I was home

00:44:03.00 eating up eating a p word sandwich uh there is a video to accompany before we

00:44:08.00 get that far down the road and I guess it's when Emily is ordering the p word

00:44:14.04 sandwich um I can it's too big for discord so let me put it in the

00:44:18.12 face slack if you guys just want to watch it just to get a reference for how

00:44:22.20 I was in the moment uh Eric has a question for you

00:44:26.06 uh okay Eric what is your why do you keep saying p word we'll get

00:44:30.10 we'll get there uh yeah I just don't like it's just

00:44:34.09 making me yeah I also I'm filling in a blank and I don't like it so if you guys

00:44:38.06 want to if you guys want to stop down for about two minutes and watch this

00:44:41.05 video then and come back to it all right okay I'll watch this video let's watch

00:44:45.20 it.

00:44:48.17 This is oh I feel like we missed out on an

00:44:54.23 opportunity we should have interacted I wish there were more so I have

00:45:00.10 yeah I have no memory of any of that but apparently I saw that van

00:45:04.23 and I uh I texted you guys about it and uh

00:45:10.23 apparently I texted you like I was a 90

00:45:13.20 year old man uh using one finger anyway so I have no

00:45:17.20 memory of any of that but we get home and uh we go from there to the to the

00:45:23.09 deli to get that sandwich and then we go home and emily's like okay you got some

00:45:27.14 more soda you got your your pea sandwich and uh you go to town I gotta leave for

00:45:31.17 a little bit she had to do some other stuff so uh I started to eat the the

00:45:36.00 sandwich and and then I got full real fast

00:45:38.10 because you know I hadn't eaten in days and so I laid down in bed as I'm

00:45:42.15 starting to come to and then I realized something terrible

00:45:46.21 has happened in my stomach and I run to the bathroom and I throw up

00:45:51.09 that sandwich oh no and it's violent and then I'm I take a step back and I'm

00:45:58.17 like okay I think I'm done I think I'm done well I did not expect that I'm

00:46:02.04 supposed to have a huge hunger I'm supposed to like eat like crazy and

00:46:06.06 replenish I'm done now I guess I'm feeling the ill effects

00:46:08.21 of the the medicine the the propofol or whatever they gave me I'm having trouble

00:46:12.08 shaking it off I think what really happened was all that soda on a five-day

00:46:16.08 empty stomach [ __ ] me up uh all the carbonation and stuff and and because

00:46:19.20 when we talked to the doctor later they were like yeah you probably should have

00:46:23.05 just had water or orange juice or something uh and so uh

00:46:26.07 I wish they wouldn't let me have that diet coke anyway so then I go back and I

00:46:30.01 lay down again and I start and I'm not feeling any better and I'm starting to

00:46:33.06 sweat and then I'm like oh no and I run and I have to throw up again and I'm on

00:46:37.11 the ground and this then it hits me hard and I'm shooting pastrami right I'm

00:46:42.10 shooting the p word in and uh and then completely nothing I could do about it

00:46:48.08 not a goddamn thing in the world I could do about it the

00:46:52.10 the the vomit is so violent and it's so it's it's so virulent it's coming out of

00:46:58.11 me with such force that I [ __ ] my pants I [ __ ] my pants bad

00:47:02.19 you know I mean it's all soup right because I haven't eaten anything in days

00:47:07.01 and so it's just like yellow green soup right

00:47:10.10 and so then I have to sh I have to sit there and finish throwing up

00:47:13.17 I have to finish vomiting with a with a just like I don't know a couple gallons

00:47:17.21 of turd like wet tur lumpy turtles in my pants so then as soon as I'm done

00:47:22.02 throwing up I have to take all my clothes off right and I put them over in

00:47:26.02 a pile and then I go yeah then I go take a

00:47:29.03 shower and I have to I have to I rinse my whole body I have to get completely

00:47:32.04 and totally clean I take a complete shower dry off and realize oh no I gotta

00:47:36.14 throw up again so I run back into the bathroom and I throw up one more time

00:47:41.01 but this time I'm naked so I just [ __ ]

00:47:43.12 all over the floor this is the second time I've [ __ ] a

00:47:47.09 bathroom floor this year I'm breaking records

00:47:50.08 and I mean it's like a shotgun blast of yellow liquid everywhere so I throw up

00:47:56.06 for a while longer and then I have to clean my entire bathroom floor then I

00:47:59.17 have to do all the laundry then I have to take another shower and then I have

00:48:04.04 to lay down here's the pastrami plot twist oh Jesus

00:48:07.17 that's the last time I will ever say that word to say it makes me nauseous to

00:48:13.20 spell it in my head makes me nauseous to think about the smell I can't ever

00:48:18.23 touch it again it's gone it's ruined for me the

00:48:22.12 colonoscopy killed that sandwich it killed that flavor and killed that word

00:48:28.05 I'm telling you I'm sweating thinking about it

00:48:31.11 I can't I can't I can't believe it I didn't see this coming I fell so hard

00:48:37.03 for it I loved it so much flew way too close to the sun and then as as my

00:48:42.01 little as as the wax melted my wings I [ __ ] all over the land and then I

00:48:47.09 plummeted down like icarus and I and I drown in a sea of of of shitty pastrami

00:48:52.14 puke and it I just it's over that's my plot twist the colonoscopy

00:48:57.12 killed the pastrami and I can't say the word anymore I'm not gonna say anymore

00:49:01.07 because it's not even specifically the colonoscopy the person that gave you the

00:49:04.21 diet coke murdered it was like it was like they put a hit maybe

00:49:09.00 that was too much flavor in my body all at once and it was I do

00:49:13.14 I there just is something wrong about having a medical procedure and the first

00:49:18.20 thing you do after to start chugging diet cokes like that just seems

00:49:22.11 inadvisable in my head it just doesn't seem yeah now could have been on water

00:49:27.01 and toast yes yeah a soda is not what I'm reaching for

00:49:31.13 after a medical procedure for sure now when

00:49:35.05 I I like I don't even want to really ask the question but I feel like I have to

00:49:41.15 when we're talking about the splatter on the scale of the smoothie you made

00:49:46.21 how bad is it is it because that's on the second one much okay okay okay

00:49:51.12 okay okay what's this much smaller much smaller room

00:49:55.17 self-contained it all stayed on the floor okay but there was a lot it was

00:50:00.09 like it was a it was a it was a covered floor but nothing got on the walls maybe

00:50:04.10 a little bit on the baseboards but like not on the walls at all not above the

00:50:07.16 Jesus uh yeah it was shut the baseboards it was maybe the lowest I felt

00:50:14.19 yeah I shot the baseboard it was maybe the lowest I've felt in quite some time

00:50:19.07 and I was [ __ ] up for a day and a half after like it took me

00:50:23.04 most of the weekend to rebound yeah it was just it was just I was in bed

00:50:28.12 like I had I felt like I had a hangover and I haven't had a drink in five years

00:50:33.20 it was horrible I can't I'm so sorry for your loss this is that's true I am too

00:50:40.10 what a day of the the joys the high of you seeing an apple van to what happened

00:50:46.13 a mere few hours later I assume yeah yeah it's what a truck it's a it's a real

00:50:52.01 tragedy man I I can't believe I I don't want it to be true I keep thinking like

00:50:56.00 I wake up the next day and I'm like maybe today it won't nope it's still the

00:50:59.08 thought of it makes me yeah if I see the

00:51:01.05 word I get nauseous I've had some drinks that I've thrown up on that I still to

00:51:05.11 this day can't drink yeah like like what what there's this

00:51:09.07 drink there was this drink in england I'm not sure if they have it here it was

00:51:14.04 called j20 which was like it was like a juice but in a bottle and uh I think I

00:51:18.02 just I had too much booze one night and then I was dehydrated so I just chugged

00:51:22.10 one of them but it was too late and I just ended up throwing up yeah but it

00:51:26.08 all just all of the j2o flavor went in my mouth and nose along with the vom and

00:51:30.10 I still hate that flavor one of my favorite drinks back in the day

00:51:34.18 that's tragic it's awful and that was just a by-product I had that with

00:51:38.04 mountain dew in high school I haven't been able to drink mountain dew since

00:51:41.11 high school because I threw up got sick from it that's not a good sign for your

00:51:44.21 pastrami returning I know dude I know I know

00:51:48.02 mountain dew's been out for about 28

00:51:50.15 years yeah this is like a weirdly regional

00:51:53.19 Chinese food but chicken balls were my go-to growing up loved them great great

00:51:59.16 Chinese food I puked once after eating them on dinner

00:52:03.18 and there was a chunk of chicken on like the the

00:52:07.03 on top of the toilet on like the seat this is like a chunk killed

00:52:11.13 killed chicken balls for me for years I still don't order them as regularly as I

00:52:15.15 used to but like never and that one never fully this is so full

00:52:19.14 circle this is palette regression this is exactly what we were talking about

00:52:25.09 this is the palette regression for sure I just oh I just I feel a bit like a

00:52:30.10 hypocrite like I was just on the rt podcast like a week ago singing the

00:52:33.20 praises of that deli meat and now like now here I am like but a few days later

00:52:39.01 and I can't I can't be in the same room as it let me smell is there a food Geoff

00:52:43.12 that you hate that is very commonly loved that people are like you really

00:52:48.19 uh yeah dude did we just lose him I lost him yeah I

00:52:51.12 think we lost him let's wait for me some

00:52:54.15 weekly uh yeah occurrence yeah he's gone now oh sit tight for oh Andrew there

00:52:59.07 must have run out of bits hello oh yeah there he goes

00:53:02.14 my computer froze sorry about that all right so my question was is there a food

00:53:05.21 that everybody loves that I hate everyone loves that you hate yes that

00:53:09.16 was my question yeah yeah what what everything white

00:53:13.19 mayonnaise cream cheese cottage cheese uh

00:53:16.15 but like that you would be sour cream I don't feel like those are necessarily

00:53:22.04 ranch dressing social foods I'm trying to think of like

00:53:26.07 pressure because I'm saying that I'm assuming you're gonna have to have a

00:53:30.12 colonoscopy again in the future at some point

00:53:33.12 and I think you should view this as an opportunity to take out another food

00:53:38.13 guacamole I can't eat guacamole all you need to do

00:53:41.05 consume drink a diet coke once again after your next one and then eat

00:53:44.21 whatever that food is and then if someone's like oh do you

00:53:47.18 want this you'd be like no I got sick when I had it I can't I honestly feel

00:53:51.12 like diet coke got off easy through this like the fact that it didn't ruin that

00:53:54.12 flavor that's true no for sure it's totally true well I don't really remember

00:53:59.01 drinking I mean I remember that I drank that coke I don't really remember that I

00:54:00.23 definitely remember eating that sandwich and I didn't taste the diet coke on the

00:54:05.07 way out I tasted the other thing a lot it was in my nose oh no yeah it was yeah

00:54:11.03 was it at least a good was it a good pastrami sandwich I apologize for using

00:54:16.06 the word was it good was it like a popular one did you at least go out on

00:54:22.00 top was it a delicious sandwich that's disappointing

00:54:24.21 my stomach felt wrong from the get-go so it may have been but when I dove in I

00:54:30.00 thought oh this isn't as enjoyable as I and I thought oh maybe I have a little

00:54:33.00 bit of a sick I gotta power through and I never even think I had like a half

00:54:36.12 through it before I had to take a break and then I then then I didn't touch it

00:54:40.16 again until it was to run into the kitchen to throw it away just to get it

00:54:44.03 out of the house there's a beautiful edit of the last time we recorded of you

00:54:48.07 in an episode discussing how excited you were for that sandwich

00:54:52.08 not knowing at that time that that would be the last time [Laughter]

00:54:56.21 you could enjoy one I had I had it all planned we had it all

00:55:00.06 planned out I was so excited it was gonna be the highlight of the

00:55:03.04 colonoscopy a the highlight of the colonoscopy would be uh that I'm there's

00:55:06.14 nothing wrong with my butthole right and

00:55:09.01 right by the way I'm fine colonoscopy is great but then the second one was gonna

00:55:12.19 be was gonna be like sit in the top uh healthy butthole mountain eating chowing

00:55:17.18 down on my favorite sandwich and instead I rolled down the mountain and every

00:55:22.08 time I I I I swung around the the sandwich hit me in the head uh until I

00:55:26.21 landed in a puddle of my own puke and [ __ ] and then I just lay there until

00:55:32.04 somebody drugged me out it's terrible it's terrible I feel it's it's a real

00:55:36.23 loss it's a real loss dude nobody feels it

00:55:39.18 more than I do I was eating this thing two or three times a week

00:55:44.15 it's true we did a video recently where we were racing we were trying to go far

00:55:48.20 on a chair that was balanced on two hoverboards and like halfway through the

00:55:52.09 video I'm just stuffing my face with a pastrami sandwich that you brought into

00:55:56.12 the office yeah I brought you guys extra sandwich but

00:56:00.15 yeah Andrew annoyed me recently what did I do uh oh he told me that

00:56:06.19 there's a store right by him that sells brands to pickle yeah

00:56:11.11 and salad cream yeah what there's a I yeah there's a store close

00:56:16.17 to me that that sells both I had no idea

00:56:20.05 I could literally see it from from where I live and it's it was there the whole

00:56:25.11 time I sent you a freaking jar that I assume was mailed from england to

00:56:29.12 america and then forwarded from by me to Canada and you could have walked

00:56:35.01 I could like a hundred percent I ordered mine from from Europe my salad

00:56:39.02 for a product that I could see from my window yeah I just didn't know

00:56:44.00 didn't know that they had it wasn't aware

00:56:46.12 I was I was trying to think I'm I'm glad that that is the thing that annoyed you

00:56:48.15 I was trying to think why did you think that I would be annoyed at something

00:56:51.22 else you did well that's what I was wondering about I was trying to think if

00:56:56.06 I annoyed you I I thought you're gonna call me out for my uh my agency blunder

00:57:01.20 my my miss call the we're talking about James

00:57:05.12 what what agency does James bond work for Geoff uh

00:57:10.12 you mean like government agency yeah like what where where would he work I

00:57:15.11 learned a lot about James bond recently uh he works for like an uh

00:57:19.18 uh I don't know what no like so I said m16

00:57:24.15 I said he worked for m16

00:57:26.21 that's not that it's close it was clean it's close

00:57:32.19 it's mi6 he works at mi6 apparently if you really think he has a one if you

00:57:38.11 read the eye as the one I was I was directionally correct like you could

00:57:42.18 mistake it for what I said I also didn't know that q's name isn't I

00:57:47.12 thought q was q I thought that was just his name that was his cool nickname not

00:57:50.21 that it was an abbreviation for his job he said he thought his name was like

00:57:54.09 Quentin or something well yeah it could be like I just thought it was a

00:57:57.14 shortened version of what his name was it's all black called Quentin who works

00:58:01.14 for a gun

00:58:03.20 well it was a conversation about what would his job title be because he's like

00:58:09.04 an inventor of gadgets but I don't think

00:58:11.05 he inventor would be what he'd be called and then that's how tourney is a

00:58:15.20 quartermaster is this that's just stands for quartermaster yeah hmm that makes

00:58:21.12 sense I thought is m not is m not a version of her name too

00:58:25.00 what's m's name probably from manager it's hinted at that her name as dench

00:58:29.22 starts with an m yeah and uh that um is called Mallory

00:58:33.14 so it just it's clearly it's just a name

00:58:35.12 thing I thought they just were very like weirdly for some reason everybody

00:58:38.19 abbreviated their name they shortened it down their nickname

00:58:43.01 take a letter from your name cue could be Quinton and his malory apparently

00:58:47.22 then they review reveal not review they didn't review em's name but they did

00:58:51.21 reveal it I want to say in sky fall right doesn't he go into her desk and

00:58:56.12 you see her name uh in casino royale he's like I had no

00:58:59.12 idea m stood for and then she interrupts him I could have swore that we saw the

00:59:04.15 name the full name and sky fall at the very end of it it could be wrong

00:59:08.19 based on everything I'm wrong about literally everything else when it comes

00:59:11.23 to James bond I don't know why I'd be right about this so let's just assume

00:59:17.03 I would I would say I when in doubt defer to Gavin on the j on

00:59:21.16 the James bond [ __ ] yeah that's fair he

00:59:24.12 knows way too much about it that's fair they're good movies they're fun

00:59:28.06 well they're all good movies I think even the bad ones well now

00:59:32.03 quantum massage just sucks I take that back there there's some genuine just bad

00:59:37.01 bond movies what do you think the worst worst James

00:59:41.05 bond movie is that I've seen I'd say quantum masalas uh

00:59:44.13 I think fiora is only a [ __ ]

00:59:46.12 yeah and I don't like on a majesty's secret service that's a

00:59:50.06 bit of a controversial one a lot of people think that one really was really

00:59:53.22 good it's a good one what's the what's the one that the non-sanctioned one they

00:59:57.09 did never say never again never say never again yeah that I don't remember that

01:00:02.15 one being great and the first casino is that the other non-eon

01:00:07.03 bond movie I think that was the David niven one yeah David niven was in the

01:00:11.07 original casino royale yeah um that's one where like James bond is very

01:00:15.04 clearly an alias and there's like a jimmy bond and like a bunch of different

01:00:18.05 James bonds right I've never seen that movie I haven't seen that one either I

01:00:21.17 think there's like six James bonds in it technically I read the book I don't

01:00:25.07 remember I I must have seen the movie when I was a kid but I don't remember it

01:00:28.15 could I I I just want to give some credit to

01:00:31.16 maybe the greatest not James bond James bond movie for a minute a movie that I

01:00:36.13 feel is under appreciated and in this time and actually Cody banks

01:00:40.10 that's a that's a good one too I was thinking today it's so weird that you

01:00:44.06 brought up agent Cody banks I was thinking have I just accidentally seen

01:00:49.07 every Frankie munez movie I felt like it was possible that I had

01:00:52.11 and it turns out he's in a lot of things that is just like obscure kind of like

01:00:58.02 post 2006 haven't seen a lot of Frankie munoz's work but um xxx

01:01:02.08 xxx is a fantastic not James bond James bond movie from the millennium what do

01:01:08.02 you mean from the millennium like the original xxx

01:01:11.09 with vin diesel what was the movie you watched on the

01:01:15.14 yes yeah yeah it was yeah yeah yes exactly that story yes I thought sorry I

01:01:22.04 misunderstood what you were saying great movie it's like if vin diesel

01:01:27.07 wanted it's vin diesel will never be cast to play

01:01:31.02 Sherlock Holmes but he clearly really wants to

01:01:34.05 and it's the closest you'll get to vin diesel as the Sherlock Holmes there's

01:01:37.16 such a great scene in that film where he's in a diner and he's like there's no

01:01:41.22 way that this person is really a waitress because she's wearing high

01:01:46.06 heels and that the shift that she works like that's that doesn't make sense

01:01:51.03 reading a newspaper on a Sunday that's a

01:01:53.22 point like he is his delivery is so dumb guy trying to be smart guy

01:01:58.02 it has a place in my heart I love that movie it's a terrible

01:02:01.15 good bad movie doesn't he like uh grind a rail or slide a rail on a serving

01:02:06.11 platter yeah yeah okay the literal beginning of that movie is

01:02:10.19 they kill traditional James bond and they're like this is the Xander cage is

01:02:16.01 the new guy sounds like the tuxedo it is a better movie than the tuxedo

01:02:20.18 I'll say it right now that's a good movie I remember it being a good movie

01:02:25.18 he drives a car off of a bridge while tony hawk films him because the guy is

01:02:30.03 like a senator who's against video games and he does a monologue about how video

01:02:34.07 games are good and then he drives his car off a bridge and the senator's name

01:02:38.19 is dick and he's like don't be a dick dick it's great writing tony hawk thinks

01:02:43.18 it's very funny it's a great terrible movie to watch

01:02:47.18 you should you should watch one and three both great you can skip two not

01:02:53.08 really needed but the first and third both the Xander cage entries of the xxx

01:02:58.08 series worth watching so wait triple x one is vin diesel then two is like ice

01:03:03.11 cube or somebody yeah yep and then three is vin diesel again

01:03:07.21 three is vin diesel again like 15 years after the first one that came out is the

01:03:12.02 second one considered canon in that universe yes because ice cube shows up

01:03:17.07 in the third movie and they do like a whole triple x agent thing why doesn't

01:03:22.19 vin diesel like being in his own sequels uh

01:03:24.22 he wasn't in the second fast and furious

01:03:26.20 either I just it was a money issue or an ego thing he's right I'll come back if

01:03:31.16 the sequel worked out and then he's just in the rest of it he strangely was

01:03:35.11 committed to the chronicles of Riddick series though he did that's the sequel

01:03:40.10 he was he was all about I think that's like

01:03:42.08 [ __ ] he had did he have something to do with with the story though

01:03:47.05 I feel like he did also maybe is the second movie a prequel technically

01:03:51.16 oh so he'll be in his own prequels yeah so like as long as the story goes

01:03:55.08 backwards he'll gladly be in the second one but he cannot make a direct

01:03:59.14 continuation unless there's a gap I still haven't seen the most recent

01:04:05.09 fast and the furious uh I I really need to

01:04:07.05 uh you see you don't have to you don't have to see it to have you've seen it I

01:04:11.08 guarantee

01:04:15.22 because those movies are so overly complicated because of how how loved han

01:04:21.05 was from the Tokyo drift movie that like Tokyo drift comes after five six and

01:04:27.22 seven I wanna say yeah just so that they could explain him

01:04:31.16 being in it but he's back in nine so like there's no reason for them doing

01:04:36.12 any of that he's just they like they found a way and I really want to know

01:04:39.23 how they bring him back I feel like he probably climbed down like a storm drain

01:04:45.09 or like lifted a manhole and dropped a boy are you in for a treat oh I cannot

01:04:49.04 yeah you're gonna you're gonna get away I wouldn't get your hopes up about it

01:04:54.10 playing the game right now and the game is we should

01:04:57.20 we should do a triple x tuxedo new fast and the furious like triple

01:05:03.01 movie head what do you call it back to back to back when you watch an apple

01:05:07.17 dumpling

01:05:10.13 we need to find a like a through line between all these movies

01:05:14.23 um trouble feature [ __ ] a trip you mentioned you mentioned how it's done

01:05:19.05 earlier do you think at this point baba bowie is more famous than bubba Louie

01:05:24.12 yeah I would think so yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

01:05:28.15 what is bob Andrew do you know who do you know who baba Louie is no I have no

01:05:32.12 idea who baba Louie is I know who bubba is your answer well there you go yeah

01:05:37.18 where's your answer bob Louie was a Hannah was a Hannah barber a cartoon

01:05:44.04 character uh from back in the 60s and Gary

01:05:46.07 who is the producer of the Howard stern show got really into collecting

01:05:49.23 animation cells uh back in like the early 80s and he bought a baba Louis

01:05:54.03 cell and he was bragging about it on the stern show and he called it baba bowie

01:05:58.23 and then Howard goes you paid 500 to this and you don't even know his name is

01:06:02.06 baba Louis you [ __ ] idiot that's your nickname from now on baba bowie and Gary

01:06:07.12 made the mistake of going yeah that'll stick

01:06:09.19 but I think in gary's defense sometimes that character was called baba boy

01:06:14.21 yeah I think so so it was Hannah barber a as a group they weren't

01:06:19.07 I remember learning those were two people and it blowing my my mind no idea

01:06:24.19 you thought it had one barbarian yeah I thought it was one person named

01:06:29.07 Hannah Barbara oh it could be first and last name that's true could work

01:06:34.15 sure should we end the show we have so many movies to watch it's true

01:06:39.22 should we just do like a rifftrax of our of our viewing I would I would love to

01:06:43.13 Danny trejos the xxx bring a trejo back can never talk about enough he's got a

01:06:49.07 great role in that they make fun of how long his hair is he is one scene

01:07:17.22 a very important question when will your far cry 6 trejo play through begin nick

01:07:23.04 they removed Danny trejo from far cry 6.

01:07:25.23 I can't do it he has been really yeah he I guess they accidentally released that

01:07:31.18 mission before it was done it's not supposed to come out yeah he's

01:07:36.19 dlc for December and they accidentally put him in with a a patch they were

01:07:40.09 doing so then they did trejo they pulled trejo out recently with a

01:07:44.20 patch note of like we've removed Danny trejo from our game we will be bringing
