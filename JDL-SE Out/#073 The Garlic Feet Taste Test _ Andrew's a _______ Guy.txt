00:00:23.17 [Music]

00:00:30.14 [Music]

00:00:37.22 So I'm just there uh [ __ ] in hand calling the police because someone's

00:00:43.09 looking at me well no I don't hello and welcome to

00:00:48.12 another episode of the F**kFuckFacePodcast is that you want to start it there sure

00:00:54.14 well wait Gavin say I editor can you please start it with get the episode

00:00:59.00 starts with Gavin saying so I'm just standing there with [ __ ] in hand calling

00:01:03.02 the police and that's the beginning of the episode

00:01:07.05 um yeah I guess without context that's interesting it's definitely an

00:01:12.12 interesting sentence so Gavin you were saying you had your [ __ ] in your hand

00:01:16.02 you were on the phone with the cops you were in your yard continue um

00:01:21.22 and then the little boy went to sleep that was the end of the fairy tale why'd

00:01:27.00 you have to make it about kids yeah no I was just trying to make it fictional

00:01:31.14 to the worst possible place you made it way worse that might have been that

00:01:36.15 might have been the worst pivot possible oh it was by far the worst

00:01:41.08 I think we may I think you may have pivoted us into a into a new start of

00:01:46.05 the episode can I just I'll pivot to just a description one how we're talking

00:01:50.00 about if you're pissing in your yard yeah and if somebody sees is that

00:01:52.23 indecent exposure I don't think it is you're in the privacy of your own

00:01:56.23 backyard yeah so I was I was saying that surely if my knob is out in view of

00:02:00.19 other people's homes that's still indecent exposure and Andrew was saying

00:02:05.09 that it would be only weird if they kept looking so I thought maybe

00:02:10.06 are they in the wrong I just I don't know the rules of that because you're in

00:02:13.22 your own space I think it's different let's say if you built like a seven foot

00:02:17.11 wooden platform stood on top of it and then was just doing whatever you want to

00:02:21.03 do up there I think that's a different conversation but if you're just on

00:02:24.17 ground level in your yard you say it's an altitude

00:02:29.03 thing I think so well if you are if you are presenting yourself beyond

00:02:33.02 the I think if you've elevated above the fence would be my rule of thumb

00:02:37.12 then it's an issue then you got a problem but as long as you're touching

00:02:41.09 the ground I think you're all good all right here we go here we go nothing

00:02:45.01 to do with it here we go I looked it up so this is only this is only for the

00:02:49.11 state of Texas so it may be different in

00:02:52.10 england and in Canada uh or the other 49

00:02:54.19 states in america uh you may be charged with indecent exposure in Texas if you

00:02:59.07 expose your naked body to the public while on your private property okay

00:03:03.11 I was right so the pub so public being potentially just a public place outside

00:03:09.01 but what if it's private property to protect it says if you expo oh to the well

00:03:13.19 so you're saying you on your private property expose yourself to someone on

00:03:18.03 their privacy yeah yeah basically like I could understand it if I'm in my front

00:03:23.09 doorway I think the public in this instance

00:03:27.02 probably refers to anyone who isn't uh living on your property okay this would

00:03:31.19 be I I would guess that would be like the legal definition that's what I would

00:03:35.11 have guessed yeah oh my god I closed that window and you

00:03:40.02 know what was the previous window cosmic crisps

00:03:42.23 I reached out to them yesterday oh yeah yeah I hope we get a reply I reached out

00:03:48.06 November 8th baby very excited I have another apple drops

00:03:52.02 I have a question uh kind of about u.s law that's curious about that well it's

00:03:57.05 kind of a strangely specific question I'm watching the Halloween movies I

00:04:01.20 think I've mentioned that before and I just watched Halloween

00:04:05.00 resurrection which is a movie all about Michael Myers is in his house

00:04:09.05 and then they go to the Michael Myers home and then he kills a bunch of people

00:04:13.05 is it does he do anything illegal technically

00:04:16.19 in that movie in certain scenarios trespassing yeah because they're all

00:04:20.05 trespassing as curious if technically Michael Myers is completely legal

00:04:24.18 in all of his action I think it depends on what state he's in they're in

00:04:30.01 I think Illinois right Illinois I'm not sure I'm not sure what the stand your

00:04:34.02 ground laws are in Illinois but yeah as this is watching you think this is very

00:04:38.00 odd I think that might be because what comes after Halloween resurrection uh

00:04:43.11 they reboot it with the rob rob zombie Halloween right so that's probably why

00:04:47.16 there was a reboot is he was innocent and uh they were like we can't we can't

00:04:52.03 prosecute this guy for defending his home territory so as a property so we'll

00:04:56.08 have to reboot the series and we'll bring in a heavy hitter like rob [ __ ]

00:05:00.02 zombie well when you bring in somebody like

00:05:02.08 bust a rhymes into your universe you have

00:05:04.01 to start over if you can't bring it back that's you need a pallet cleanser

00:05:08.01 I don't know but bust a rhymes is the best part of that movie by far he was

00:05:11.12 pretty great he was pretty great have you seen Halloween resurrection Gavin no

00:05:15.07 I've never I don't think I've ever seen anything apart from the first one

00:05:18.08 there's a scene where buster rhymes dresses up as Michael Myers and Michael

00:05:22.12 meyer starts following him as Michael Myers and then he turns

00:05:26.10 around and he thinks that somebody else dressed as Michael Myers he's like what

00:05:29.20 are you doing here I'm the Michael Myers of this show what are you doing get out

00:05:33.13 of here skedaddle Michael Myers skidaddle get out of here and Michael

00:05:37.03 Myers just like turns around and walks away it's great buster rhymes is the

00:05:40.09 only good thing about that movie is fantastic

00:05:44.17 oh so did we start the episode yeah no I feel like we're well in at this point

00:05:50.18 Gavin 73 I believe 73. I was talking to Andrew a little bit

00:05:55.22 before we started gav before you before you showed up early which was shocking

00:06:01.05 uh yeah it's a way let this be known episode 73 I think is the first episode

00:06:05.12 you've ever shown up early for uh I don't know if that's true I don't think

00:06:08.22 that's the second second episode you've ever showed up

00:06:11.18 early for not sure how I feel about it to be honest with you I feel like uh the

00:06:15.12 six minutes leading up to the episode is my safe space with Andrew to talk about

00:06:20.19 you yeah I think I was about five or six minutes early I just wanted

00:06:26.00 to uh get get my tools ready no I hear you we got a lot to talk about today uh

00:06:31.15 first off Gavin got a little peek last night uh got an update on the baseball

00:06:36.00 throw we need to deal with that oh [ __ ]

00:06:38.19 uh there's a timeline that we need to uh

00:06:41.09 lay out what do you mean a timeline uh I would just say Andrew don't don't get

00:06:46.19 your hopes up I'm [ __ ] he's he's Geoffing this isn't he no no Kevin please

00:06:50.21 you have to support me here no there's uh

00:06:53.18 what are you what have you done you're extenuating circumstances oh [ __ ] you

00:06:59.00 I would say he's he's Geoff again but it's out of his

00:07:02.09 hands okay thank you uh I would like to talk about how uh you know the the first

00:07:06.06 off I don't know if we covered it in an episode I don't think we did cause I

00:07:09.14 don't think it happened yet but the baseball knobs sold out in an hour and

00:07:13.16 nine minutes which was phenomenal the hell's a baseball knob baseball bat knob

00:07:18.21 I'm sorry oh because I'm getting ahead of myself the baseball bat knobs we sold

00:07:24.04 a thousand of them in uh in about an hour and nine minutes so thank you so

00:07:30.10 much for supporting such a dumb idea put a lot of love and effort into it uh

00:07:34.11 they ruined uh the comfort of my home for a good couple most of the summer as

00:07:38.19 I had to move them around from room to room to get anywhere and uh I'm pretty

00:07:43.02 sure it put a strain on the relationship that I didn't realize at the time

00:07:46.07 between my girlfriend and I but things have been better since the bat knobs are

00:07:49.18 gone I'll say that uh anyway so overwhelmed with the

00:07:52.15 support uh and we wanted to come up with what to do next we talked about uh a

00:07:56.23 thousand baseballs and I had uh I was actually talking about with Emily at

00:08:00.02 lunch of the day I think we landed on a great way to figure out how to sign and

00:08:04.13 not sign some of the balls so let me let me I've already talked about this with

00:08:07.14 Gavin but let me present it to you Andrew okay but before you do can I just

00:08:10.22 put a last the last pile of dirt on the on the knobs the last comment about the

00:08:15.09 knob and the bad situation yeah I ordered one haven't got mine yet my

00:08:19.18 confusion I've said multiple times I'm still kind of confused about part of it

00:08:25.07 so we just there's a hundred you sawed off a hundred knobs from

00:08:30.08 full-size bats and the bad ends had the logo on it and we sent out a hundred

00:08:34.06 random bad ends right with the knobs like 100 random people got them

00:08:38.20 is that correct okay continue your story well I'm just

00:08:42.06 I'm just confirming that was the thing 100 random people got full bats right uh

00:08:46.08 I don't know if it was 100 random or the first hundred to order I'm not sure but

00:08:50.15 uh I don't have anybody from the store here to ask okay whatever 100 people got

00:08:54.12 a bet I don't unders so when we started we're like why don't we sell full bats

00:08:59.23 wait wait they got their own bat piece for their own knob I don't think so I

00:09:05.16 don't I don't did they I think so yeah I don't know

00:09:08.08 we're still confused we're confused on a whole other level I just don't under go

00:09:11.16 ahead what are you gonna defeat the whole

00:09:13.22 purpose about trying to find your back end I don't know if that was even a part

00:09:18.13 of it my confusion was that we were gonna sell full bats

00:09:21.11 and we were it was like oh we can't do that logistical nightmare not not the

00:09:25.14 it's just complicated but we've sold full batch that we're

00:09:28.23 just in two pieces and one piece is only like two inches off the bottom so I

00:09:32.09 don't know what I'm saying like that's why we sold mini bats it's because full

00:09:37.11 bats yeah well yeah because uh it turns out

00:09:39.13 a full bat is uh two inches too big so we had to cut them to make them check

00:09:44.10 the boxes so yeah fair enough I just I was confused yeah no uh initially

00:09:49.18 when we looked into it it looked like it

00:09:52.08 was going to be difficult to sell a full bat

00:09:54.18 uh and ship it but as we perfected and went through the process painstakingly

00:09:59.11 over months and months and months they

00:10:01.22 were able to work out a solution to [ __ ]

00:10:04.19 I'm happy they did wait so originally we didn't sell a full bat because we

00:10:08.13 thought it was gonna be too difficult so

00:10:10.23 we sold a tiny bat then we found out you could I'll be honest and then we still

00:10:14.08 didn't I'll be honest I don't remember why we did or didn't I don't remember if

00:10:19.10 I was wanting to sell a full no we talked about it

00:10:22.13 they're like posters can't do it I just remember wanted wanting to do something

00:10:26.19 after manually burning in the numbers and all

00:10:30.03 the bats I wanted I wanted to manipulate the next product in some way and to

00:10:34.04 continue that lineage which is where I'm going I love I love that you love the

00:10:37.13 bat knob Andrew I love that you bought one to show your support I love that you

00:10:42.10 uh you've registered your confusion it is officially uh on the books it's a

00:10:46.13 regulation registration so that's that's there forever it's there it's in it's

00:10:52.06 entered in so we have that thank you uh but I would like to move on from the

00:10:55.14 past the highly successful thousand bat knob run past talk about a thousand

00:11:00.16 baseballs we talked about taking a thousand baseballs putting a face logo

00:11:04.11 on them and then we joked around about if I could hit it like I could swing at

00:11:07.18 a thousand baseballs how many would I hit or not maybe the ones that I hit we

00:11:11.12 could sell the ones that I don't hit or we could sell as as a on a different

00:11:15.14 tier and the ones that I swing and miss on if there are any if there are any

00:11:20.04 that I miss uh those would be sold at a different rate right so then a a

00:11:23.23 having a lunch brainstorm and came up with this idea credit goes to Emily for

00:11:27.02 helping me come up with it uh what if I take the I already have all this

00:11:30.12 equipment right I saved four or five full-size baseball bats they're in my

00:11:34.08 they're in my spare bedroom so I can take the full-size baseball bats then I

00:11:37.18 can take the wood burning kit that I have and I can autograph my name deeply

00:11:43.09 into the barrel over and over again kind of all over like maybe put like 20

00:11:47.06 autographs all over the bat barrel right where you connect with the ball then we

00:11:53.11 get a big bucket of ink or paint okay we stand it next to a

00:11:56.18 next to uh to home plate in a batter's box and then we put all we load a

00:12:01.12 thousand baseballs into the picturing machine then I dip the bat in into the

00:12:06.12 ink or paint and then I swing in a ball and when I connect with the ball my the

00:12:11.18 paint that has now gotten into the grooves of the baseball bat uh of my

00:12:16.23 signature connects with the ball and it stamps my signature on the ball and

00:12:21.09 that's how we autograph a thousand baseballs I love this idea I think it's

00:12:25.13 a fantastic I think it's the best idea ever I think it's a great idea but I I

00:12:29.19 think it should be like a blind box situation where you they're all the same

00:12:33.08 price but you don't know whether you'll get a hit or not okay I'm fine with that

00:12:36.23 too I'm fine with that too I don't I I don't care how we portion it out I just

00:12:41.12 want to I just want to do it and I mean I suspect it'll be interesting because

00:12:46.23 if I out of out of a thousand swings I I

00:12:48.22 may hit 900 balls so it may be rarer not to get an autograph in this situation

00:12:53.16 than to get one I was going the other way I was immediately thinking with

00:12:57.12 gavin's idea I think the concern is we might be greatly overestimating how many

00:13:02.10 pulls you could hit there might only be like 85 balls with

00:13:06.14 autographs so uh anyway I'm excited about getting jumping into that uh and

00:13:11.03 hitting the thousand balls and all that but I wanna get the ball throw out of

00:13:16.12 the way first so I wanna you know talk about a timeline

00:13:20.15 uh and and unfortunately that's been pushed back just a teeny bit because of

00:13:24.12 some because of some issues okay should we get straight into your issues

00:13:29.09 yeah okay well he let me preface by saying uh I went to a party on Saturday

00:13:34.23 oh no a daytime yard party right uh Fred it was lovely I hadn't been in a

00:13:40.09 backyard like garden party and since before coveted it was amazing I had a

00:13:45.06 lovely time I got to speak to some interesting people catch up with some

00:13:49.11 old friends nothing none of it related to the day job outside of work stuff it

00:13:53.17 was really great uh however uh in the process I was talking to another friend

00:13:59.01 of mine who was explaining that he uh for like two years had had what he

00:14:04.10 thought was like a pulled muscle on his groin kind of like near his hip

00:14:08.03 and uh it just would like never heal or heal for a couple weeks and then he

00:14:11.03 would re-pull it and then and eventually he just got so frustrated with it he

00:14:14.13 mentioned it to a doctor when he was like in a physical and the doctor was

00:14:18.02 like oh you probably have a groinal hernia and he was like yeah most people

00:14:21.02 think of hernias as like you get that like bulge when your intestines are

00:14:25.16 poking out or whatever but aggroinal hernia they don't poke out it's just

00:14:29.00 like a muscle tear and so he uh he had a ct scan and he found out he had one and

00:14:34.21 he uh he got it sewn up and now he's on the mend right so

00:14:38.02 as he was explaining that to me I was realizing that what he's describing I

00:14:43.11 live with I've lived with for probably six years uh I have a thing

00:14:47.12 that is I have a pulled muscle and like to the left like kind of under my I

00:14:51.13 don't know like where your leg creases kind of on my left leg that uh is like a

00:14:55.23 pulled muscle that never quite heals and comes and goes and feels wrong like it

00:15:00.11 feels different than a pulled muscle and it's [ __ ] it drives me nuts and I

00:15:04.10 always just think I'm a wimp right so that I was thinking

00:15:07.15 before I throw this [ __ ] baseball maybe I should go to the doctor and make

00:15:11.04 sure I don't have a hernia because I don't want to I don't want to cause any

00:15:15.09 additional damage because I'm about to go through some serious uh serious

00:15:18.21 training regimen I have tools I have supply I went to the [ __ ] sports

00:15:23.13 store my trunk is full of [ __ ] uh so that I can begin this process so I just

00:15:28.09 need to go to the doctor as of Saturday I just needed to go to the doctor uh

00:15:32.12 just just bounce this off him he could say no idiot it's there's no way you

00:15:36.15 have a hernia go home you're fine throw your baseball or you can say let's get a

00:15:40.12 ct scan and see oh you do have a hernia you probably rip your leg off if you

00:15:43.20 threw this baseball 80 miles an hour let's patch that up for a couple you

00:15:47.12 take a month off and then you're ready to go right I I I'm desperate to

00:15:51.04 complete this challenge because I know I can do it I just have to set myself up

00:15:55.09 for success okay after that that little bit of knowledge which in my

00:15:59.11 head I think all right this is pushing this is pushing the baseball down a

00:16:02.17 little down the road a little bit but not too much Andrew will understand

00:16:06.00 then I was feeling great Andrew I was feeling on top of the world uh Saturday

00:16:10.02 night I decided to play tennis so uh Emily and Millie and I went out we

00:16:12.23 played we played tennis from like eight to ten on Saturday night like with the

00:16:16.17 lights on at the park it was [ __ ]

00:16:19.20 cool uh felt awesome Sunday got up went on a 22 mile bike ride the weather was

00:16:23.19 beautiful I could go at my own speed because I wasn't dragging Gavin or

00:16:27.07 trevin Trevor behind me it was super easy uh it was just it was perfect I

00:16:32.08 came home I'm telling you I was on top of the

00:16:35.09 world I felt like I was 25 years old again Andrew I was full of sun my body

00:16:40.13 was lean and exercised I was full of that that post-workout energy I looked

00:16:44.22 at the backyard and I thought I'm going to cut this [ __ ] grass today that's

00:16:47.23 what I'm going to do I'm going to be product I had fun this morning I'm going

00:16:51.20 to be productive this afternoon and I walked into the house and walked into

00:16:55.09 the bedroom and I saw some laundry on the on the sofa in the bedroom and I

00:16:58.18 said uh oh before I cut the grass why don't I put that folded laundry away and

00:17:03.18 be doubly productive because I'm in such a good mood I'm doing house chores just

00:17:08.08 sorry quick pot is this related to the to the

00:17:11.05 photo of laundry that we saw or is this is this a separate this is that's the

00:17:15.01 pho that's the photo yeah okay Emily sent you guys a picture of laundry what

00:17:19.11 do you think happened Andrew uh I don't know at this point it's clearly

00:17:24.00 Geoff got injured somehow trying to fold laundry it sounds like

00:17:28.13 I will say it's very funny because you went on a list of like every sporting

00:17:33.00 event a human could do you're like I did this I did that I did that I kept

00:17:36.12 waiting for the injury to happen if you're gonna tell me that it happened on

00:17:40.03 a folding laundry incident I didn't fold this laundry Andrew okay you're just

00:17:44.08 grabbing I I I wasn't the one to fold it yeah it was uh I believe it was two

00:17:48.13 pairs of pants uh girl pants so they're smaller it's my

00:17:51.17 girlfriend's pants not mine and two two or three of her t-shirts all folded up

00:17:56.17 and I just bent over to pick it up and the second I I I reached my destination

00:18:02.00 my hands reached that uh that little pile of laundry I realized I

00:18:07.07 would never be able to stand again my back in that moment broke in half oh no

00:18:13.11 I've never felt the pain like that like the muscle pull

00:18:19.11 Emily was on the phone with her parents having like a like Sunday call

00:18:24.22 and I went

00:18:26.17 and I just I just collapsed and I became instantly bedridden

00:18:33.01 and I I just got out of bed yesterday yesterday was my Wednesday was my first

00:18:38.07 day out of bed I for the first day I showed it together meg I uh because they

00:18:43.01 came over for survivor last night I had to have a chair next to the bed so that

00:18:47.05 I could stand up and then push the chair like like old people walkers I could

00:18:51.12 push the chair just to the toilet so I could pee and back and that process half

00:18:57.04 an hour half an hour to pee easily and excruciatingly painful I have sneezed

00:19:01.05 more this week than in my entire life each sneeze is like getting pun it's

00:19:05.23 like getting it's like bane snapping batman's back in half that's what it

00:19:10.19 feels like to sneeze it has been brutal brutal I tell you I have been I'm

00:19:15.10 sitting in a special chair is the only way I can sit up in my house so I'm

00:19:19.14 looking up at my computer like a little like like I'm a [ __ ] toddler because

00:19:23.04 it's so far above me it I I cannot tell you the hell that I have been in since

00:19:27.19 Sunday afternoon you do not need to explain that you're forgetting you're

00:19:31.13 talking to the man with the worst ankles possibly on the plane I understand that

00:19:36.07 pain

00:19:40.08 because survivor is always the day before we record face we always try and

00:19:45.05 avoid anything that might be mentioned on purpose but we I had that picture

00:19:51.01 that he said both of us and um he was moving real slow he was

00:19:55.14 hobbling around between rooms and I was like

00:19:59.03 wait are you injured and he would just like I don't want to talk about it

00:20:04.02 I held off for as long as I could he was at like the the speed of a 90 year old

00:20:09.09 it was but also trying to play it off like he wasn't that injured so bad

00:20:14.04 and then and then he pulled the photo up and he and meg started trying to guess

00:20:18.12 it and so eventually it came out but yeah because I immediately saw the laundry

00:20:23.12 and I thought well Geoff is [ __ ] all those clothes

00:20:27.03 I didn't I didn't know an injury was even a factor I couldn't

00:20:31.12 move it around I was like oh well yeah an absolute how did Geoff [ __ ] on

00:20:35.07 this pile of clothing what did he do to destroy it did he drop another like

00:20:40.15 smoothie bomb and it went all over the clothes there's some [ __ ]

00:20:45.04 how do you shoot his jeans at his shirt and his

00:20:48.20 socks oh my god guys I'm I moved my toaster last week and I cleaned up more

00:20:53.17 smoothie wow [Laughter]

00:20:56.04 it was behind the toaster somehow so I need to

00:20:59.07 I need to just double check I may have missed this did you not have a shoulder

00:21:04.22 issue was that just what what was that what shoulder issue the whole you opened

00:21:10.00 this whole story about how you talked to a guy that had a thing wrong with his

00:21:14.09 hip and it turned out to be an issue oh a hernia yeah I don't know yeah I got so

00:21:18.12 I just this is where I am in the timeline I have to get back to where I

00:21:22.08 can leave the house again like mobile and move around and stuff and when I do

00:21:26.20 that like when I'm capable of leaving the house I will then go to the doctor

00:21:31.06 get this hernia thing checked out once I get the aok from the doctor then I'm

00:21:35.07 gonna throw a [ __ ] baseball jack just asked me today he was like would you be

00:21:39.13 willing to do your first baseball throw on extra life as like a charity thing so

00:21:44.13 I was gonna talk that over with you guys and see if you want to allow minor

00:21:48.03 league fan jack to co-opt our uh silly uh thing for the greater good or if we

00:21:53.04 should tell them to go suck eggs but anyway uh I just wanted to give you

00:21:56.09 a heads up that's why I haven't thrown the ball yet it's because I just have to

00:22:01.01 get through these these minor setbacks so that I can throw the ball

00:22:04.08 healthy so that then I can uh have my three months to if I need it to get to

00:22:10.10 80 miles an hour and then then it's [ __ ] then I'm teeing off on the

00:22:15.18 baseballs boom signature boom signature boom signature should we have a wall

00:22:21.05 behind you for all of the strikes like different colored eggs

00:22:25.01 yeah it just says like loser stamped on to it so the ball hits that.

00:22:30.21 I have complete sympathy for your situation Geoff I hope your back gets

00:22:35.14 better soon I hope it's thank you not a long-term injury I will say though and I

00:22:40.04 just want to throw this out there I feel like you coin storied us again I really

00:22:44.15 feel like that you just did another version of the coin store at the sock

00:22:48.09 the sock thing I think you just did that twice well I feel like the build up was

00:22:52.13 necessary because he did all this other stuff in the day that wasn't you know

00:22:56.22 that was way more intensive than laundry picking we learned a thing about him

00:23:02.00 that had nothing ultimately to do with the point of his story

00:23:05.01 and it just if anything was like a fake tease

00:23:09.03 everything I told you is germane to my ability to throw this ball if I have a

00:23:14.00 hernia I gotta get that fixed before I can throw the ball but if I don't have a

00:23:17.21 hernia then we're fine but that that's unrelated to what's currently happening

00:23:22.00 you can't correct correct go through it it's like a series of events well

00:23:25.23 because it's something that we got to deal with between now and the ball

00:23:28.22 because now that I know about the pot the possibility of a groinal hernia I

00:23:33.04 have to investigate it it has to be dealt with before I can throw the ball

00:23:37.10 so I I don't want to throw I pardon the the the reference but I don't

00:23:41.23 want to throw a curve ball in the 11th hour when you're not

00:23:45.12 expecting and be like oh by the way I forgot to tell you because I don't want

00:23:48.12 to pile on uh because I didn't think it was necessary to the laundry story that

00:23:53.04 I also have a hernia like three weeks from now or some [ __ ] I want I want to

00:23:56.11 give you all the information I have as I have it okay so this is you're saying

00:24:01.22 there are no other possible issues this is it this is you wanted it all at one

00:24:05.17 time the hurdles are your back and you might have a hernia the other the other

00:24:10.17 potential issue but I'm dealing with it and I won't let it be a problem

00:24:14.18 is I have uh I have uh seemed to have developed a pretty sense pretty severe

00:24:20.02 case of tennis elbow uh from my tennis lessons but I bought a I bought it

00:24:24.23 in my throwing arm but I bought a compression sleeve so uh

00:24:29.10 I'm gonna worry about it I think okay there's no way you're throwing 80

00:24:34.09 regardless I got this I got this we just got to get

00:24:38.19 through these minor health hiccups so make sure that I'm in [ __ ] fit as a

00:24:43.01 fiddle and then I'm going to start throwing the heat you're gonna be the

00:24:46.16 first person to end up in a full body cast from throne that's what's gonna

00:24:50.12 happen.

00:24:52.17 I don't think you should try [Laughter]

00:24:57.11 I just I just have to do it in a way that's not going to snap my back in half

00:25:03.09 oh wow okay so we have no idea when your

00:25:07.07 back will heal hopefully soon hope it's quick then

00:25:11.02 I [ __ ] hope so dude because I'm I'm out of town next week to go ride roller

00:25:14.20 coasters.

00:25:17.11 I hope I can do that also I can't record next week but I assume everybody knew

00:25:22.15 that okay anyway that was my that was my small update on where the ball is

00:25:27.13 uh in progress still in progress never stop being in

00:25:31.12 progress I assumed in progress gonna be even longer with the injury I still I

00:25:35.18 don't think I don't think I'm gonna guess you throw

00:25:38.18 50 and I don't think you get above 65.

00:25:41.11 And I assume that you're gonna blame the ball that's

00:25:44.07 my ultimate guess for all this stuff you're gonna go through all the [ __ ]

00:25:47.22 medical exams you're going through it's like you're going to space the amount of

00:25:51.05 training you're going through this and then you're just going to be like the

00:25:54.04 balls off and then just deny we'll be delaying for the weather a few times

00:25:58.15 absolutely if you two are gonna be at the same place for it we're never gonna

00:26:02.15 get it done you guys gotta do it independently this [ __ ] he

00:26:06.19 continues to be just an albatross around the neck of a good time

00:26:11.21 let me tell you [ __ ] last night we're watching survivor everything's fine

00:26:17.08 everything's going a-okay we're like I don't know four-fifths of the way

00:26:21.23 through the show and Gavin goes no power went out uh hulu seems to be

00:26:26.19 working uh nothing got in the way of us watching

00:26:29.04 the episode and meg looked at him and goes you [ __ ] [ __ ] you just jinxed

00:26:34.06 us he's like ah British that's not real whatever dumb [ __ ] he said

00:26:38.21 not two minutes later in tribal council in the middle of tribal council [ __ ]

00:26:44.10 halo hulu goes out comes back goes down again [Music]

00:26:48.13 everyone was extremely mad at me and I feel like I was only

00:26:53.11 40 to blame god damn dude why did you say that.

00:26:59.22 I can't I'm just I'm still sad I'm still disappointed about the the outcome

00:27:05.05 I don't know if spoilers are not or whatever I'm not going to say the person

00:27:09.05 but I feel like it was a devastating loss to the season I think he's the person

00:27:14.21 I I truly believe it I was so excited every week to hear a different take on

00:27:20.01 broccoli and how he fumbles it but he doesn't know what he was saying

00:27:25.07 oh he was he was my pick to win I love how he's self-aware about that too yeah

00:27:30.13 that was great I really [ __ ] sucked at that yeah I didn't like how I said it

00:27:36.04 I assumed that he would like go over to the guy and be all private about it I

00:27:40.12 didn't expect him to just [ __ ]

00:27:40.12 declare on the mat I don't think that's I don't think they have to do all that

00:27:45.02 context because then he walked over and was like I'm sure that like I don't

00:27:49.07 think you need to I think they do have to say in front of everyone

00:27:54.00 well I don't okay it's such a favorite thing Geoff's always like all right

00:27:59.09 weird even though he knows exactly what's going on oh

00:28:03.22 yeah Geoff Bruce is great at playing that [ __ ] straight he's like if you say so

00:28:08.17 moving on anyway that's the survivor update of the week yeah I will say

00:28:13.00 the one thing that was great about watching it last night was

00:28:15.18 you know we all picked our characters and you know Gavin picked brad and I

00:28:19.06 picked Tiffany and last night was just an it was just watching we both could

00:28:24.21 tell one of us was going home and it was just watching two people just [ __ ]

00:28:30.01 just fall fall through survival my pick had a big sway in the decision we were

00:28:34.08 all involved in some way you two felt like one of you were going home

00:28:38.02 my pick was like I got to make this choice disappointed

00:28:41.14 disappointed in my pick just hum and do some evil [ __ ] that's what you do

00:28:46.04 vote the other one oh uh if you want for the baseball

00:28:49.22 portion of this non-baseball podcast I will say uh Yankees red sox wild card

00:28:54.12 game the other night there was so much don zimmer coverage it was awesome he

00:28:59.02 showed up in a bunch of different vignettes they showed the Pedro fight

00:29:03.07 they had all kinds of zimmer coverage if you're a zimmer if you're a fan of the

00:29:06.09 zim it was a good it was a good time to tune in I'm so glad you mentioned that

00:29:09.18 because I was watching that and they had a cut they were doing like history of

00:29:13.19 the series between the teams and they just showed an image of don zimmer face

00:29:18.13 in the grass when he fell that's like that's a nice flattering image

00:29:23.01 of all the images for that you choose that to be the representation of

00:29:27.21 face first on impact and Pedro Martinez uh who threw him uh you know the Pedro

00:29:32.18 in the don Pedro project that I'm working on he uh he is one of the color

00:29:37.20 commentators for like the uh tia or tbs like before the game

00:29:42.13 coverage with Ernie from uh inside the nba on tnt then he's very funny and very

00:29:48.16 uh colorful I'll say he's a funny dude [Applause]

00:29:57.21 about therapy is through a bunch of analogies we get oil changes for our

00:30:02.03 cars to prevent bigger issues down the road we see the doctor and we go to the

00:30:05.19 gym to take care of our bodies to prevent injury and disease we do chores

00:30:10.11 while some of us do chores regularly to avoid messy houses going to therapy is

00:30:14.17 like all of the above it is routine maintenance for your mental and

00:30:18.00 emotional wellness to prevent bigger issues down the road going to therapy

00:32:29.22 my front door just um let me go see if my garlic thing showed up I'll be right

00:32:34.23 back what do you mean you're garlic we should also cover the um

00:32:38.10 see I'm not a blank guy list yeah oh I think we need to touch on garlic

00:32:42.14 and then and then we could do that yeah you want to do it that way around I

00:32:46.21 think so because I've had my foot in garlic for an hour now so

00:32:51.17 I feel like we need to mention it it was supposed to you always just do stuff

00:32:57.09 well no no no no let me here the science said you had to do it an hour before

00:33:01.19 that it didn't kick in until an hour into it so you're the only one partaking

00:33:06.02 in this experiment so I put it in has not been why did you tell me when I was

00:33:11.14 six minutes early now I didn't know it getting ready men I

00:33:15.11 didn't know anyone else was doing garlic I'm cool I'm getting garlic I'm making

00:33:20.00 cheese and pickle sandwiches dude I'm getting all the [ __ ] what do

00:33:23.05 you mean what what are you talking about we're halfway through you're too late

00:33:27.09 anyway are we regardless are we garlickin well did you hear that Geoff

00:33:31.20 I've been garlic king no what's up apparently [ __ ] the experiment only

00:33:35.16 works if you've had your foot in garlic for an hour so I was saying why didn't

00:33:39.20 he tell me that when I was six minutes early I could have dunked the first I've

00:33:43.22 been sitting here next to a tray of garlic I could have put my foot in it okay

00:33:48.00 I think the second thing is you need to contain it as well like it's it's you

00:33:52.02 need to wrap it it's not just that your foot is in I think it's a reformation no

00:33:58.02 no no no not to contain it I dude I I saw your garlic I have like minced

00:34:02.17 liquid garlic that's gonna be that's gonna [ __ ] that's it's gonna seep

00:34:06.11 into my pores hold on which foot let me I'll show you I'll post I got

00:34:10.22 I've been wearing a garlic shoe for this entire podcast so oh this sucks I'm

00:34:15.05 going out for a meal tonight I'm gonna be just tasting garlic based on the

00:34:19.07 freaking stuff that was on my foot an hour ago this is this is my foot I'm

00:34:25.03 just good garlic [ __ ]

00:34:27.05 so here andrew's foot is wrapped that is the most disgusting picture I've ever

00:34:30.21 seen I can I can one-up you buddy hold on a

00:34:33.23 second oh that's just gonna be full of sweat there's no way that's gone

00:34:38.21 he sweat locked his foot and there's garlic in the back you're supposed to

00:34:43.14 contain it and it takes an hour so I thought we'd break it up at the

00:34:47.07 beginning and I'd say when the garlic kicked it

00:34:49.12 we're 30 minutes in I'm starting to get some garlic and a knife and I was just

00:34:54.05 gonna spread some on well your foot I got a foot full of garlic and I ordered

00:34:58.06 a steak so I can see if I can flavor the steak in my mouth with the

00:35:01.17 garlic yeah I made a cheese and branston sandwich and I was gonna knife some

00:35:05.00 garlic onto the bottom of my foot and see if I could taste it in the sandwich

00:35:08.04 wait you thought that you'd immediately taste

00:35:11.09 garlic after you just spread it on the rolls

00:35:14.08 what are you spreading what type of spread you got an aioli what are you

00:35:19.11 doing what do you mean it's a little ju is it oh let me oh Jesus.

00:35:37.18 the dressing in that that olive oil what is it no it's just it's just minced

00:35:43.11 garlic oh it's pure it's pure garlic are you just gonna post a [ __ ] photo

00:36:06.13 oh here's my steak also it's supposed to just be an

00:36:11.03 unseasoned steak there's no way that's not seasoned what are you doing I

00:36:15.18 ordered it I ordered an unseasoned steak

00:36:18.21 and the steakhouse canceled my order two minutes before the podcast started so I

00:36:23.12 had to order something from outback steakhouse

00:36:26.23 you're telling me that steak isn't seasoned look at that steak

00:36:30.16 all right it's going on the foot pepper all over the place what are you doing

00:36:36.04 it's not seasoning garlic it's seasoned and pepper oh it's some oil in this

00:36:41.01 oh I got broccoli where on the foot is is the prime area I it's the heel I

00:36:46.12 believe but oh my god I put it everywhere except my heel doing

00:37:08.14 safeguarded the information and didn't let us have it well I didn't know you're

00:37:11.21 gonna use it first of all from the things I've said this is just incorrect

00:37:16.00 if anything you should be happy Geoff you're eating a [ __ ] steak that looks

00:37:19.20 delicious yeah it's good but I can't taste the

00:37:23.22 garlic it looks like I've stepped in cat vomit what are you doing Gavin what why

00:37:48.02 no you could really if you want to make foot stuff then go for it

00:37:54.23 just really narrow it in the specific category of foot on garlic finally

00:38:00.12 something it says fart hard in that picture

00:38:03.14 it's a great photo have you rolled your ankle it looks swollen it's just the

00:38:08.16 angle oh okay it always looks weird if I take him at the wrong angle

00:38:17.12 just opened it of course like I don't know I can't taste this garlic yep yeah

00:38:23.04 I'm I'm gonna take it by the sandwich an hour

00:38:26.06 I think it takes an hour to kick in tasting garlic with feet

00:38:30.17 like cheese and pickle so I'll just leave my foot in the thing

00:38:35.12 well Andrew you've had uh you've had your foot in garlic for a full hour how

00:38:39.00 does it how does it taste I'm not getting a lot of taste yet I'm getting

00:38:42.13 some some through the nose like I feel like I can smell it like deep

00:38:46.21 deep in the nose but it's not it's not in the mouth yet you think maybe that's

00:38:50.08 all it is I mean we'll find out we're gonna I'm I'm in a position if I'm

00:38:55.02 gonna taste it I'm gonna take like we will find out definitively

00:38:59.00 I got some bread I was gonna have garlic toast or garlic bread there's no garlic

00:39:04.17 on the bread just foot garlic I will say the um

00:39:07.20 the cheese and brenson sandwich with gentle wuffs of garlic it's pretty nice

00:39:12.16 I'm not sure I'm tasting it uh what's your food that you're eating I'm eating

00:39:17.01 bread I was gonna do garlic bread yeah garlic bread was the idea are you a

00:39:21.14 garlic bread guy I'm a huge garlic bread guy

00:39:24.23 love garlic bread get some cheese on there melted fanta it's a great food and

00:39:29.02 I think it might be the best bread I'd go as far as thing garlic bread is the

00:39:32.12 best bread uh oh I don't know I'd have to think about that for a while but it

00:39:36.10 is very very good I'm I'm I'm recently a two things guy I know we're gonna do a

00:39:40.01 whole segment about your things but I just discovered I am a I was talking

00:39:43.12 about Gavin last night I want to get into this in a big way with face I'm a

00:39:48.00 koozie guy now I'm falling hard for koozies and oh my god are you guys aware

00:39:53.03 of pastrami I was like an idea phenomenal I am a [ __ ]

00:39:58.08 pastrami guy through and through I have discovered

00:40:02.06 over the course of the last like three weeks I cannot get enough pastrami in me

00:40:07.23 it is so good okay I've never eaten pastrami before how do you never pastrami

00:40:14.02 yeah it's not a big thing in this like in the south in america yeah

00:40:19.05 yeah oh that's my bad I should have said the hour I'll I'll th that's on me oh

00:40:23.15 that's

00:40:27.07 like face up what are you doing you don't have the thing to put your foot

00:40:31.04 into well I don't have a tray I was just going to spread it on hoping it'd be

00:40:34.04 like butter but it is chewing it's more the consistency of cat sick so

00:40:38.23 it's sort of if I don't keep my foot upright it's just gonna slough off onto

00:40:42.12 the carpet I just the decisions it's my fault about the hour I don't know what

00:40:46.10 you're doing with your game plan the fact you don't have a tray that's a

00:40:51.14 clear cookie sheet situation I got my foot's nestled safely in a

00:40:55.20 cookie sheet it's [ __ ] great

00:40:58.12 so it says strong it says to try for yourself cut a piece

00:41:02.21 of fresh garlic in half then in a separate room that doesn't smell like

00:41:07.23 garlic take off your shoes and socks and place your feet into a plastic bag with

00:41:12.18 the piece of garlic after an hour you'll be able to both

00:41:16.04 taste and smell the card neither of you are doing any of it right you've missed

00:41:20.01 on every level it's not contained it's not fresh garlic

00:41:25.22 you don't have a time you do not have the time to taste the garlic but I feel

00:41:30.23 like you have to stick with what you're doing until you get that hour to find

00:41:35.18 out if there is any effect in a separate room that doesn't smell like garlic

00:41:39.20 how is that important does it mean you should stay in there

00:41:42.19 well no no it's just you know garlic gives a lot of odor so you don't want to

00:41:46.01 be you like want to establish this isn't

00:41:48.08 from cutting up the garlic in this space you're smelling that you're in a garlic

00:41:51.18 freeze out outside of what's on your foot oh can I give you guys a little bit

00:41:55.05 of good oh there's good veggies can I give you guys a little bit of good uh

00:42:00.06 good face news yes yes the most recent episode of face to be in

00:42:04.15 the report I don't know if it's this wednesday's episode no it'd be last

00:42:10.02 week's episode so that was 70 or 71 I think it was the

00:42:13.14 probably the spicy icy episode that's which episode was

00:42:17.18 70 which was the mid-episode retraction and retrain and anus

00:42:22.13 okay that one that is the uh on track to be the highest uh viewed episode or

00:42:26.12 listen to episode of all time wow that's awesome yeah yeah it's uh doing really

00:42:30.15 well thank you to everybody who's listening and sharing it for real thank

00:42:34.00 you so much to everybody who's listening and some of you appear to be listening

00:42:41.08 somebody about it super appreciate that too it's nice to know that people are

00:42:45.02 listening I really appreciate I really appreciate the people who are actually

00:42:48.15 telling because it's a gamble it's a gamble

00:42:51.07 saying hey listen to this podcast give up your time for this [ __ ]

00:42:55.03 I I feel like that's a special bond if you if you know someone you would share

00:42:59.07 this podcast with I think that's great for your friendship

00:43:02.01 listen you need to hear me out but they put a bunch of garlic on their feet

00:43:07.03 but they did it wrong and that's why it's funny god damn dude the thing

00:43:14.21 I don't even know if I did it right to be completely honest we're gonna if

00:43:19.10 we're just gonna be sharing things here I don't know if I did it right I don't

00:43:22.19 think I cut into every piece I've got five pieces of garlic in the bag I cut

00:43:27.14 two and a half I guess three of them I think that's a 3k I think it's enough I

00:43:31.06 think if I'm going to get it I'm going to get it at that point all I know is

00:43:34.04 that I don't want to be anywhere near that when you open the bag

00:43:36.22 it's going to be that's the problem rancid here's the thing I don't I'm

00:43:41.03 scared to do it I don't know when I'm gonna take this bag off it might just be

00:43:44.16 here for a while just shove that bag just take your foot

00:43:48.17 with that bag and shove it in the fire extinguisher bag I just nest make it

00:43:52.16 like a matrix doll of uh dumb [ __ ]

00:43:54.22 you've done on this podcast yeah take it out of that bag dunk it straight in the

00:43:58.15 fire extinguisher dust and it will uh dampen the smell realistically I don't

00:44:02.20 know why I'd have to take the bag off like what would be the thing that forces

00:44:06.18 me to do it I think I could live my life with this foot bag for a while you're a

00:44:10.21 fool I don't want to I don't want to I'm just

00:44:14.12 saying I think I could you could and here I'm gonna I'm gonna go through

00:44:18.19 something this reminds me of a piece of golden amazing brilliant early internet

00:44:24.15 uh do you guys remember the spark.com there uh I think it's like a it's like

00:44:29.15 it's like a cliff notes kind of thing and then I I think it eventually turned

00:44:33.11 into a dating site um but before that they did like it was like an internet

00:44:38.01 well they called them e-insights everything nothing site but it was like

00:44:41.16 a blog like entertainment back in the day and there was a guy on there named

00:44:44.17 christian who would do all these experiments he had this one called the

00:44:46.04 date my sister project he did a bunch of different stuff but he did one called

00:44:50.23 there was one called the stinky meat project where somebody took a whole

00:44:54.11 bunch of uh like barbecue and they put it on a plate and then they hid it in

00:44:58.07 their neighbor's backyard and then they just would sneak over once a day and

00:45:02.02 document it as it was deteriorating and seeing how long it would take his

00:45:05.01 neighbors to notice the smell so he did one that was like a response to that

00:45:08.19 called the stinky feet project where he went I think he's from Boston he went

00:45:13.01 into a public like a ymca shower barefoot with one

00:45:17.17 foot and he walked around the shower uh and bathroom barefoot and then he stuck

00:45:22.11 his foot in a plastic bag for 30 days and didn't take it out oh it was called

00:45:26.10 the stinky feet project oh geez to see like what would happen to him and he

00:45:30.04 documented it hilariously the whole way and uh he ended up with like you know

00:45:35.00 all manner of issues with his foot but Jesus Christ was any of it permanent I

00:45:39.03 don't know I don't know that was so this was like pre-rooster teeth this was

00:45:44.06 early 2000's uh probably 20012002 but uh if you could

00:45:48.04 probably find it online it was a very funny you know it was back then it was

00:45:52.00 all like pictures and and and yes there was pre video so very funny I feel like

00:45:56.20 as long as I hop on one leg I could commit crimes right now and I'd be good

00:46:02.06 I wouldn't get caught except you would leave a trail of garlic

00:46:05.18 smell all the way back I'm like I'm like a batman villain the

00:46:10.05 garlic bandit yeah yep [Laughter]

00:46:12.13 I think I smell garlic right now I think it's coming I think it's kicking

00:46:17.09 in I can really I got some garlic in the air that's

00:46:20.17 probably because there's garlic have you achieved a full hour yeah no I've I put

00:46:26.00 this on 74 minutes ago so I'm getting I feel like I'm getting I feel like it's

00:46:31.09 kicking in I feel like I'm getting some strong strong garden garden gla garlic

00:46:36.11 I can't even say it strong garlic odors right now yeah but that's because

00:46:40.09 there's actually garlic in your foot no but it's in my nose right like it's it's

00:46:44.12 deep yeah listen you wouldn't understand you didn't do this experiment

00:46:48.17 but it is it's in my core have you wrapped the bag

00:46:51.23 enough to the point where you know no garlic is leaking out I taped the [ __ ]

00:46:56.08 out of the top of that bag I did like oh yeah

00:47:00.17 oh it's gonna be a problem when I take off this bag that's not gonna be fun

00:47:06.13 do you know I think I know the next face uniform uh project we could make garlic

00:47:11.18 bags garlic patches garlic patches for your feet yeah almost like I like those

00:47:17.01 like icy hot patches you put on your back but that imbue the power of garlic

00:47:22.05 into your foot so that you could be like hey you know my girlfriend doesn't like

00:47:25.17 when I eat garlic because it gives me a stinky mouth but I like to eat garlic

00:47:29.07 with my dinner so like an hour before you go to your restaurant slap on a

00:47:32.14 garlic patch on the heel of your foot put your sock in your shoe on like

00:47:36.02 normal eat go eat your steak and your mashed potatoes you'll be tasting garlic

00:47:39.23 all goddamn day long but when you get a kisser at the end of the night you won't

00:47:43.20 have garlic breath would it be like a massive nicotine patch

00:47:46.23 like with like a big band-aid with a garlic like lump in the middle

00:47:50.15 it could be yeah we'll call it flavor foot it's gonna revolutionize the world

00:47:54.17 could it just be socks Geoff could we sell could it would it be a garlic sock

00:47:58.19 product maybe it looks socks it looks like a normal

00:48:02.00 sock but you slip it over two left garlic socks I was asking the I had a

00:48:06.16 merch meeting yesterday and I was I was asking the merch guys if we could sell

00:48:10.02 like uh face branded like tiger balm and icy hot for all of my injuries

00:48:16.10 what they said no yeah I feel like that's a tough one yeah

00:48:21.18 also all of your relationship to tiger bomb on this show has been shoving it in

00:48:26.06 your [ __ ] I don't feel like that's the thing you then want to sell like is

00:48:29.17 that well I wanted to get like the patch from my back because I've been going

00:48:33.11 through them that's fair you're [ __ ] back

00:48:37.12 you're going to ride roller coasters next week [Laughter]

00:48:41.18 I'm definitely going to see them I don't know if I'll ride them

00:48:45.15 you just made my week Geoff all of next week I'll be thinking about you and your

00:48:49.12 shitty back walking around I'm not gonna be I don't know how much

00:48:53.10 walking I'll be doing either you're gonna experience zero amusement at this

00:48:57.11 amusement park it's gonna be fantastic it's gonna make me very happy jack made

00:49:01.09 a joke today that he would just push me around in a wheelchair so I don't I

00:49:05.07 can't get out of it and that actually seems like a solution to me so I'm I'm

00:49:10.17 open to that if I have to just like the idea of some fan

00:49:14.13 seeing that and taking a picture [Laughter]

00:49:27.16 oh this girl I'm getting a lot of garlic I'm tasting it

00:49:31.09 it's working the science is working you're tasting it just in your mouth I'm

00:49:36.06 tasting it in my mouth right now this is [ __ ] crazy I didn't expect this to

00:49:41.10 work are you are you still garlic king Gavin

00:49:44.08 no I I was my leg was going numb and I wasn't like an hour in so I just scraped

00:49:49.12 the garlic off my sandwich was gone I had a feeling you

00:49:53.01 were gonna [ __ ] out but for the record I am still garlic king so I'm I gotta be

00:49:56.13 going on 30 minutes at this point I should I should be getting

00:49:59.22 I mean you're missing key steps but I'm I could I need to try I need to have

00:50:03.04 some bread give me a minute let me get this bread let me open this up see if

00:50:07.05 this is some garlic bread well it should be toast really shouldn't

00:50:10.11 it for the full effect well is it no there's not you can have garlic

00:50:15.09 bread without it being toasted what do you think's more iconic garlic bread or

00:50:20.19 garlic mashed potatoes oh garlic bread yeah I guess by a lot

00:50:25.01 garlic mashed potatoes are great that that reminds me we need to I feel like

00:50:28.13 we need to get into this list because there's some things

00:50:31.07 yeah let's get into the list there's some things that we need to address with

00:50:36.04 this so an amazing comment leaver has compiled a list of all of the

00:50:41.04 I'm not or I am a blank guy moments from Andrew

00:50:44.10 and it is uh an insane thing to read in a row

00:50:48.15 should I just read down the list and then we can get into the like do you

00:50:52.14 remember what they are uh do you want to do that or do you want to go one by one

00:50:56.16 and then like address yeah let's go one by one and I can address them

00:51:00.23 as they appear okay it's definitely what I'm immediately noticing is

00:51:04.19 it's definitely ramped up as face has gone on towards the beginning there's

00:51:08.18 like a seven episode gap where you never

00:51:11.20 said it there's a nine episode gap after that all right

00:51:15.20 episode one it just says unsure if he's a dan bilzerian guy definitely not a

00:51:21.13 damn bizarre

00:51:26.06 still true not a good medical person I don't know

00:51:31.07 what that I'm gonna assume it's like I don't know what that is I don't know

00:51:35.15 what that is but I think it's probably true I'd say that's okay

00:51:38.22 do you want to move on from that one is that the best uh well I I'm gonna guess

00:51:43.03 that that's probably related to like going to get checked out when my ankles

00:51:47.11 [ __ ] up or something like that like I'm gonna assume it's that episode 19

00:51:51.13 not an egg guy still not an egg I still haven't tried it like a classic

00:51:56.03 classic moment not a big chocolate fan see that is I

00:52:00.07 want to I want to clarify that that's an important clarification I it's not that

00:52:04.08 I dislike choc I would say I'm not a chocolate guy I think that's true I

00:52:09.11 prefer like salt but you okay Geoff you getting some garlic.

00:52:15.03 I feel like you may have moved his foot.

00:52:19.20 I haven't moved my foot at all but I'm telling you I'm sitting in garlic juice

00:52:25.14 I think it's dude my nose all at once just started

00:52:29.03 tickling in the back and like burning like I had wasabi or something

00:52:34.06 and I definitely can smell garlic in a way I couldn't before a deep a deep

00:52:39.23 garlic smell oh it's uncomfortable [Music]

00:52:44.06 sorry sorry continue I think my favorite thing about this list is that for

00:52:49.02 episode one you were unsure if you were a Denver guy it wasn't like

00:52:53.09 I didn't know I don't think he knew who he was I didn't really know who he was

00:52:58.19 yeah I've learned since not a not a damn blizzarian guy at all

00:53:01.19 episode 21 not a frozen fruit guy this is I need to talk about this this has

00:53:06.06 been a big recent change in my life I am now put it on record I'm now a big

00:53:11.22 frozen fruit guy whoa frozen episode 21 not a frozen fruit guy

00:53:17.03 episode 73 a frozen fruit guy yep no it's on the on the books I would almost

00:53:21.11 go as far as saying I recently have gotten into some frozen raspberries like

00:53:25.08 store-bought frozen in a bag raspberries

00:53:27.14 game changer might be my favorite way to

00:53:29.22 eat raspberries at this point throw them

00:53:31.21 in some water use them as ice cubes just eat them out of the bag they're

00:53:34.23 delicious you better like blend them up on even a smoothie well I'm sure you

00:53:38.13 could do that too I haven't gone that far yet I've just I've used them as like

00:53:42.12 good on ice cubes and frost yeah they're great try it it's [ __ ]

00:53:47.01 delicious highly recommend are you an ice eater

00:53:50.05 because a lot of people just ch like chewing gum ice cream

00:53:54.23 that's another thing I I was also I hated ice I've become a nice guy I'm not

00:53:59.02 gonna chew on them I'm not a big chewing ice guy but I'm putting them in some

00:54:03.18 drinks recently outcast was right cooler there is something cooler than

00:54:08.15 cool and it's ice cold and it's [ __ ]

00:54:11.01 great put some ice in that drink you're gonna have a great time I used to

00:54:15.05 just think oh it's in the fridge it's cool I'm good enough no you get some ice

00:54:20.06 cubes in there it is delicious big ice cream list faster that I can

00:54:24.13 read it all right not a big syrup guy that's true in the same episode

00:54:29.14 not a pants guy I don't even own a pair of pants so yeah still remains true do

00:54:35.05 you not own no no I hate paint not a caffeine person yeah it's not a

00:54:39.16 judgment I just don't drink coffee I'm not a big energy drink consumer I just

00:54:43.12 don't have a lot of caffeine but nothing against it are you still are you still

00:54:48.15 using your keurig to make uh other [ __ ]

00:54:51.11 I I haven't used it in a while uh to make anything but hot chocolate I'm

00:54:54.19 still in some hot chocolate rotation with it but I haven't used it for ramen

00:54:59.05 recently gotcha no cooking recipes episode 29

00:55:02.11 would love to be a hat guy I would absolutely love to be a hat guy it's

00:55:07.03 just it's my head's too big I can't do it

00:55:10.13 in the same episode not a big party guy okay that's absolutely the one where you

00:55:15.17 sat in the chair yeah probably it was within the context of that I'd assume

00:55:22.00 episode 30. Not a mayo guy not a soup guy not a heating guy not a heating gun

00:55:28.03 so we need to we need to tackle these one at a time I am still not a mayo guy

00:55:34.03 but holy [ __ ] am I an aioli guy I [ __ ] love an aioli you give me a

00:55:39.01 roasted garlic I know it's just mayo but

00:55:41.07 if you dab a different word you fancy it

00:55:43.06 up and call it a daioli I'm all on board

00:55:45.13 give me endless aioli but I hate mayo so you like flavored mayo is what you're

00:55:49.17 saying I'm a fan of flavored mayo and I'm okay with mayo as long as I know

00:55:53.02 it's not there it needs to be a sneaky mayo so do you think uh one step up from

00:55:57.13 the condiment challenge would be the aioli challenge I don't want us to touch

00:56:03.05 condiments ever in the future I'm not scared of this podcast

00:56:08.12 you also can't do better than a garlic aioli so there's no point there's no

00:56:13.04 evolution on it last night at survivor meg brought up the the condiment thing

00:56:17.18 and I was just like nope

00:56:23.16 still not a soup guy absolutely hate heating not a fan of it in any way not a

00:56:28.14 fan what does that mean heating like radiators or like central air yeah yeah

00:56:32.20 like like if I if I want my place to be as cool as it possibly can be I don't

00:56:36.22 like it when it's hot outside I much prefer cold over hot but what if you're

00:56:41.22 too cold I'm never too cold never doesn't happen it's never an issue okay

00:56:47.05 still not a soup guy interesting because there's some good soups out there

00:56:50.14 there's some great soups I could see myself eventually becoming a soup guy

00:56:54.12 but I just haven't I haven't experienced what's your favorite soup Gavin yeah I

00:56:57.13 feel like mine was an acquired taste my favorite soup is probably my least

00:57:00.21 favorite soup when I was growing up tomato and basil mmm that's a good soup

00:57:04.18 you do you feel like you have to be grown up to um to really enjoy it yeah I

00:57:10.04 remember as a kid just being like look same with the smell uh episode 32

00:57:15.05 oh this one he's he's made sure not to just blindly

00:57:19.11 put them in he's clarified asked if he's not much of a bat guy by Geoff

00:57:25.12 I feel like that one doesn't really count yeah I was gonna say I would say

00:57:29.15 at that time not a bad guy at this point I own like four bats so I think I'm

00:57:34.21 definitively a bad guy at this point I have to be episode 33

00:57:38.13 the return of not a pants guy the second mentioning I need it to be known that's

00:57:43.14 how much I dislike pants it needs multiple sayings I am not do not accuse

00:57:48.13 me of being a paints guy it's not true uh there was then a seven episode gap

00:57:52.16 when you stated I'm not a sox guy still true not a socks guy don't like him it's

00:57:57.14 like a prison on your feet I don't like him I like my feet to breathe coming

00:58:01.06 from the guy with a bag of garlic straps this is my commitment to the show

00:58:05.23 this isn't the thing I do [Music]

00:58:08.09 uh episode 41

00:58:09.11 not the sound guy I don't know what that means

00:58:13.03 maybe we were dealing with oh that was in the interest so we're probably

00:58:17.05 dealing with your tech problems I assume oh that makes sense you also said not a

00:58:21.20 social media guy coming from the guy who's been on social media for over a

00:58:26.03 decade I think I don't know what that what does that mean what do you mean you

00:58:29.21 said you're not a social media guy yeah but what does the the for a decade thing

00:58:33.23 what does that mean are you saying that well it doesn't matter when I got it I

00:58:37.21 barely use it um I like I look at tweets I'm not posting a lot almost everything

00:58:43.07 I post is related to the show I think I've had a twitter account for 13 years

00:58:46.20 and I've less than I'd say 700 tweets pretty low I'd say you're a social media

00:58:51.21 guy nah I I bet you I bet you I bet you 300 of those are show related uh okay

00:58:57.02 well possibly episode 44.

00:59:00.08 A mere four episodes after not a sox guy Andrew declares he is not a socks guy

00:59:06.19 once again twice in the same episode.

00:59:13.16 Andrew feels so strongly about restrictive clothing I'm not a fan of

00:59:18.20 those three mentions of not a socks yeah once in 40 and twice and 44. Episode 45

00:59:24.12 don't understand this one at all not a fine ideas guy this is what I think it

00:59:30.15 is I've thought about this and I agree with this statement

00:59:34.23 so I'm a big fan of either terrible ideas or great ideas I don't like a

00:59:40.00 decent idea a middle idea isn't that exciting

00:59:42.12 it's fine that plan is a fine plan I either want it to be a horrible plan or

00:59:47.16 a great plan I'm not a big fine idea this guy

00:59:50.20 fine you think that's all that means is that right I think so I haven't checked

00:59:56.02 but I'm assuming that's the context episode 46 not a hand towel guy I never

01:00:01.14 use them don't need them unneeded are you are you more of a like a

01:00:08.00 Dyson air blade or an accelerator guy like a blower guy or are you talking

01:00:13.02 like in the bathroom at home you just sort of shake your hands dry oh you're

01:00:16.12 shaking the hands and yeah from if we're talking a food situation I'm not even a

01:00:21.03 napkin guy don't need it I'm careful with what I do I'm precise

01:00:26.02 I don't need anything not a napkin I'm careful with what I do I am I make sure

01:00:33.14 the sauce the food ratio is fine it's not gonna spill if it does then I just

01:00:38.21 have to live with it that's life you have consequences for your actions when

01:00:43.16 you stepped in a sushi container yeah I assumed there was some residue in it

01:00:47.13 what did you how did you get that off no I don't think there was I think it was

01:00:50.20 just like a top it was the top it was the cover part I don't think there was

01:00:54.10 anything there and if I did I would have stepped in it

01:00:57.23 I I'm probably just having a shower at that point if it's

01:01:02.07 we're washing it away you would say a paper towel is is the tool of the

01:01:07.05 imprecise thing uh well a paper towel I feel like has other

01:01:11.14 uses than just culinary that's the thing you could wipe down

01:01:15.11 all sorts of things with so I I yeah I I wouldn't say that I don't think episode

01:01:22.08 47 not a butt doctor I feel [Laughter]

01:01:34.19 tell me about how cars are barking at you again um what

01:01:40.23 was that the one where I said did you have an anal fissure you think and then

01:01:45.11 I doubled yeah I think that was the uh yeah fatal trenches era probably yeah

01:01:50.14 episode 49 this is a hell of a lot not a big phone person not a hot not a

01:01:56.07 cold or hot what does it say oh yeah not a big phone person not a cold or room

01:02:01.12 temperature cheese guy not a big ham person that's all

01:02:07.18 all true I don't use my phone all that often uh I'm not not big on apps on the

01:02:12.23 phone I uh can't stand if you're gonna have

01:02:16.06 cheese on something to better be melted there's nothing more disappointing to me

01:02:21.14 than some of your once again sort of like the mayo I'm not

01:02:26.12 gonna order it if it's there I'm fine with it episode 51

01:02:30.23 not a cold guy that so with that that is in with your

01:02:34.12 um this is the thing I need yeah I love the cold I'm a big fan of the cold I

01:02:40.00 don't know what this would be in reference to

01:02:43.14 well I I feel like I feel like it's similar to what you just said where you

01:02:48.08 say you don't get cold you're not a cold guy oh

01:02:51.08 that could be it you may decipher it I do not get cold yeah no I think that

01:02:55.14 might be right Gavin that's a good call by you that was my prediction anyway

01:03:00.10 we'll have to verify these obviously uh episode 52 not an arts and crafts guy I

01:03:05.22 think my basket shows otherwise I think I've changed that I think it's clearly

01:03:11.05 I clearly am at this point episode 53 not a big mashed potato

01:03:15.03 person see this is the other thing I am the biggest potato guy

01:03:19.23 maybe in Canada I'm a big potato guy I love his

01:03:24.01 statement you're the biggest potato guy in Canada I think so I love a potato

01:03:28.18 I'll take a potato any meal you don't like it mashed is that what you know I

01:03:32.04 love mashed potatoes I don't know what you're talking about I feel like this

01:03:35.17 may have been and I'm just gonna I'm gonna make a prediction here this one I

01:03:38.23 I was trying to make hash browns and they turned into mashed potatoes and I

01:03:42.11 didn't know how to then make mashed potato I don't really know how to make

01:03:45.17 mashed potatoes but I'll eat the [ __ ]

01:03:47.15 out of some mashed potatoes I love a good match so it's more of a I'm not a

01:03:51.12 big mashed potatoes preparation person yeah I'm not a big mashed potato recipe

01:03:56.11 guy is probably actually how that should read I would assume because I am a huge

01:04:01.11 mashed potato guy episode 56 not a can guy also true

01:04:04.21 respect the can I just don't drink many things out of a can not a canned guy a

01:04:10.18 six episode break and then episode 62

01:04:13.16 not a pasta guy once again true nothing against it I just not my rotation to

01:04:18.19 foods all that often that's still true fair play

01:04:22.17 so I remember this one episode 63 not a measuring guy I mean

01:04:26.17 I think dinklage just says it all we all have it's this is not a thing I'm good

01:04:30.10 at I feel like a a really uh talented artist comment leaver or rooster teeth

01:04:35.07 artist could make a like a campaign-style poster of Andrew like

01:04:39.09 vote for Andrew running for biggest potato guy in Canada and then it could

01:04:44.10 have all the vote for Andrew he's a and then all of the things you are and and

01:04:49.11 he's also not a this could be all of the attributes

01:04:54.06 because of your platforms it could just be a bunch of things with a little

01:04:59.03 check box it's either xd out or it's got a checklist [Laughter]

01:05:06.13 I'm sorry there's an x through eating but a tick

01:05:12.19 I want one where I've reversed position like the frozen fruit like it's an

01:05:17.16 accident it's a double it's like scribbled out yeah

01:05:22.10 that'd be an awesome poster oh man episode 65

01:05:27.03 not a big bike guy specifically big bikes apparently I'm not a big guy

01:05:32.19 I love a little bike but not a big bike which leads us directly into episode 66

01:05:38.17 not a big rules guy this is a real moral dilemma for me

01:05:43.05 because I think I think that's true but as I've also said I'm a big recipe guy I

01:05:49.15 will follow that recipe to a tea I will obey the laws of a recipe

01:05:54.21 but general rules it's a little sometimes they're dumb sometimes there's

01:05:59.22 some dumb rules an episode 68

01:06:02.15 not a knot guy yeah yeah no that's very true so like tying knots I I think I've

01:06:08.08 we talked about this before I had boat safety grade five I was like I'm gonna

01:06:12.22 ace this [ __ ] boat safety course I'm gonna do amazing at it there's a whole

01:06:16.03 section on knots and I gave up that's the end of my pursuit of a perfect score

01:06:20.17 can't do it oh so shout out to uh was this you username Evie

01:06:25.01 Lincoln evil Lincoln Evie Lincoln was it died

01:06:30.23 I think you nailed it one of the two there's no way it's not one of the two

01:06:35.22 things he said I'm glad you took the shot at it Kevin

01:06:39.20 because I didn't know how to read it either

01:06:41.19 I appreciate you making the attempt yeah it's like a

01:06:46.04 both words use the I it looks like yeah dude Evie eevee evil evil Lincoln uh

01:06:51.02 thank you that might have been the funniest

01:06:54.08 segment in the history of this podcast we got some new

01:06:57.13 we got some new stuff out of it too oh my god I'm reading yeah we got new

01:07:01.06 segments in the list it honestly makes you sound like a complete psychopath it

01:07:04.19 does reading that back-to-back over the course of like over a year it's like

01:07:09.18 yeah look at all these guys rules trying to

01:07:13.10 make a mental picture of of that person in your head while you're listening to

01:07:20.00 it yeah oh my god I'd love to see that in a flow chart it goes down

01:07:25.07 to Andrew pen ton

01:07:29.12 oh there's also like an additional section of stuff that you were unsure

01:07:33.10 about but yeah I don't know if you want to get into that one I know maybe we do

01:07:37.16 that next time there's not many of them yeah oh yeah that was good

01:07:48.23 it's weird to think about that like in the future if I go back and listen to

01:07:53.12 this episode I'll just know that I had a bag of garlic taped to my feet the

01:07:57.20 entire time.

01:08:01.18 [Laughter]

01:08:05.09 Oh I got to be honest I still don't taste garlic I thought I smelled it for

01:08:10.15 a bit there when my nose got tickly but I I have a mild taste it's not as

01:08:15.16 powerful as I want but it's definitely I smell it like it's deep in the nose I

01:08:19.12 feel it there not much of a taste though I don't think that this could replace

01:08:24.21 applying garlic to your food directly is

01:08:27.16 what I declare from from this experiment well maybe

01:08:30.00 see that's we we can that's the nice thing about the garlic patch right or

01:08:34.01 the foot flavor the flavor foot uh is we can increase the uh

01:08:38.08 we can we can increase the amount of garlic the concentration of garlic or

01:08:42.23 whatever that molecule is and so that we

01:08:44.21 can really just like like it's like when you take a vitamin b pill and it gives

01:08:49.18 you like 1200 percent the daily recommended allotment

01:08:52.11 we can just like [ __ ] just like cram like

01:08:55.09 a way too dangerous amount of garlic into your body so that you really get a

01:08:58.23 sense of it should I try to take this bag off as we end the show I'm assuming

01:09:03.14 we're at the end oh yeah in the episode

01:09:12.17 what was that

01:09:15.22 this is not easy

01:09:20.19 oh it smells so garlicky

01:09:25.09 okay I don't know what you were expecting ah.

01:09:49.07 Gavin I just had a great idea for a prank

01:09:53.12 you know how do you know how when you're

01:09:56.15 a kid and you have sleepovers and you'll like put somebody's hand in warm water

01:10:01.19 to make them pee the bed we should start garlic bagging people's feet and then

01:10:07.09 see if they wake up from garlic's taste to their mouth oh

01:10:12.19 oh like garlic masks for the foot.

01:10:18.10 I got hiccups oh man that was disgusting hey thanks
