00:00:15.07 Hello and welcome to another episode of the F**kFuckFacePodcast it's the 120th time

00:00:21.20 these idiots have talked my name is Geoff Ramsey with me as always Gavin free

00:00:26.20 Andrew panton first off I'm just going to get it out of the way right now [ __ ]

00:00:32.19 my life and [ __ ] my body how are you guys doing my team dude

00:00:36.14 how am I the most healthy one of the three this has never happened this is a

00:00:40.14 rare event are you at 100 right now yeah I feel pretty good how's your ankle

00:00:44.12 hundred percent still [ __ ] you so it's it your ankle is that

00:00:48.08 you could walk a marathon I could potentially hypothetically but as we

00:00:52.03 said I'm enjoying this 100 lifestyle for a little bit ask me the same question

00:00:55.17 Gavin how are you doing man how's your what percentage are you specifically

00:00:59.06 asking about my ankles Kevin how are your ankles about 50

00:01:03.14 what happened I think it was like two weeks ago Eric said I was the Andrew of

00:01:09.12 that podcast probably in the extra medium [ __ ] yeah I am definitely the

00:01:13.12 Andrew of I have bad ankles oh no well at 50 would you say your ankles are

00:01:17.18 extra medium I'd say they couldn't get more medium than that man

00:01:21.23 listen before we get get uh off on an aside the extra medium thing

00:01:26.23 really blew up in a way I did not anticipate god damn man never seen nothing

00:01:33.12 nothing but extra medium [ __ ] for the last week of a couple days of my life

00:01:39.09 I've never seen so many regulation listeners turn in their comment lever

00:01:42.23 cards I I saw people saying they were becoming comment leavers just for this

00:01:46.22 conversation I saw people responding to those people who became comment leavers

00:01:51.12 just for that it was like an infection this is like man this this might be the

00:01:57.09 most commented thing since since maybe the pencil or condiments it's been wild

00:02:01.05 but Kevin why are your ankles at 50

00:02:03.10 means you're in a cast maybe what's going on

00:02:06.13 well I'm getting the uh I'm getting the hockey teeth in my wall fixed

00:02:11.14 I had to move I had to move my desk but the desk is

00:02:15.16 really heavy like without anything on it and also I didn't want to take

00:02:18.13 everything off it so I just thought you know I'll lift up one side sort of

00:02:23.01 shimmy it round lift up the other side keep doing that a few times

00:02:26.01 and uh I did one side the side without you know just has like a printer on that

00:02:29.14 side of the legs the other side has like a big hard drive the big server thing a

00:02:33.11 big raid and my pc so I thought oh this one's gonna be a

00:02:36.19 bit more serious and I gave it a few little test lifts I was like okay I

00:02:40.13 think my arms and back can take it here we go and I just hoisted the whole thing

00:02:45.22 up instead of lifting the table up I sank down about two inches as both of my

00:02:50.23 ankles rolled and I just ended up just like twisted outwards just like oh

00:02:56.07 I just didn't ever consider my ankles to

00:02:58.17 be the point of failure and I think it's to do with the fact that I'm still you

00:03:02.15 know I'm still recovering from the the pelvic injury from does it do so I maybe

00:03:06.17 wasn't stood as straight as I usually am and I just

00:03:10.04 I did not expect to go downwards and then

00:03:13.22 and I ended up just rolling around the floor uh once again contemplating my age

00:03:20.19 and uh career choices can you walk yeah but you know it kind of hurts to like I

00:03:25.04 still go on walks and stuff but I just it starts hurting sooner what I just

00:03:29.12 need like an mot I just need a look a look over from a doctor I need x-rays

00:03:33.05 one side hurt more than the other uh is one angle ankle worse than the other

00:03:38.21 ankle no it's a pretty even pop across both instead of I think instead of

00:03:44.10 instead of going down to a zero percent on one ankle like breaking it it just

00:03:49.16 split the damage across both so I'm just a half one

00:03:52.12 I I think you're saying the word pop for

00:03:55.14 effect but when you say it I feel like I heard like

00:03:59.03 it was the probably the most bone cracks I've heard oh

00:04:02.14 from my body ever because it was both ankles at the same time it was deafening

00:04:07.05 I I'm gonna I these hockey teeth are troubling me and I'll tell you why I

00:04:12.00 tried really hard to as a friend to help this process I just got the impression

00:04:16.10 you didn't want my help or by uh or my presence at any point I could have

00:04:20.05 helped you move this table man I spent four hours moving back into my bedroom

00:04:24.04 last night I can do it yeah and I thought you know it'd be really fun to

00:04:27.07 try and fix the wall but then I realized that the people who hacked it to pieces

00:04:31.04 were more than happy to repair it so I thought oh I might as well take the free

00:04:34.20 repair oh yeah yeah that makes sense I just had to move my desk you know in

00:04:38.21 the end after about eight hours of not being able to walk good I came back

00:04:44.08 to my desk I took everything off it and I moved it with great ease fantastic

00:04:49.05 so I'm trying to I'm visualizing I don't know if you remember in old wrestling

00:04:52.08 games in like the top left corner there's the outline of the human body

00:04:56.12 and as areas get hurt more it becomes like increasingly red so right now I'm

00:05:01.10 just seeing you with like deep red ankles

00:05:04.12 is that the only issue where else on the

00:05:07.03 body because it sounds like you both are in trouble imagine

00:05:12.04 what happened to Gavin what happened no no no here we're we're here Gavin

00:05:16.23 started talking do you think he's gonna be restarted oh you can't hear me

00:05:20.14 anymore oh my god you're back you stopped talking we're a technical

00:05:24.17 difficulties podcast we were just talking about no we're not

00:05:27.21 a technical difficulties podcast yeah I said I what I said was what did I say I

00:05:32.06 said yeah imagine um you're playing doom and my ankles are the doom guy and they

00:05:36.12 both have nosebleeds I said something like that okay

00:05:40.09 it's a wild visual okay oh I see there's a screen the old doom yeah where the

00:05:46.04 hell I get it okay I understood it when he gets all right

00:05:49.09 yeah I'm sure the original delivery was better than me trying to remember I just

00:05:52.17 no but what about your upper because you

00:05:55.05 had the other injuries from before so we got like a yellow midsection what's

00:05:58.08 going on on the rest of the scale yeah it has the hamburger on the left hip I'm

00:06:03.01 probably at eighty percent oh yeah pip boy

00:06:06.10 so I'd say yeah both ankles crippled and uh

00:06:09.12 left hip left hips just got like half a bar

00:06:12.13 okay how about you Geoff what's going on with you

00:06:15.01 well mine's a whole thing I feel like we're running through the greatest hits

00:06:20.08 of Geoff's misery in the last week no I was talking about

00:06:24.00 this with Eric the other day well first off

00:06:26.13 I think I had just had the bike wreck after when I saw you guys last time when

00:06:30.21 we recorded last time I was apparently running on adrenaline uh

00:06:35.12 and the excitement of having a story to tell

00:06:38.19 everything went downhill pretty much from from that night on

00:06:41.21 I don't remember what the situation what the living arrangements were at that

00:06:46.00 point but there's just been a confluence of of just [ __ ] myself right in the

00:06:51.01 butthole well what was it that Eric wrote on on slack yeah that was there's

00:06:55.10 the big turn because before last time when we left off there was discussion

00:06:59.03 around that you were gonna hit a bunch of baseballs tomorrow morning yeah

00:07:03.18 that's not happening so yeah this was on

00:07:06.17 uh the 26th of august Eric in the in the face slack wrote hey after seeing Geoff

00:07:10.15 today there's no way we're hitting baseballs

00:07:14.15 yeah which is tomorrow now I'm walking again so that's good

00:07:18.08 that's that's your status update is that you were walking again yeah I'm walking

00:07:23.01 again fairly well uh I don't think I'm hitting baseballs or anything um we'll

00:07:27.23 just go from there so for the bike rack uh the ankle it turns out it was very

00:07:33.20 very sprained and that was real bad um the knee scabbed up real hard

00:07:38.06 and did you guys ever um I don't know if you were scabby boys when you were

00:07:42.05 growing up but I always I was always falling into something and getting

00:07:45.09 covered in scabs and you know how like when you you get a scab on an elbow or a

00:07:49.05 knee when you're a kid and then if you get up or sit down too fast or bend your

00:07:52.23 arm too fast it cracks the scab in half yeah I'm doing that a couple times a day

00:07:57.03 right now so it's like it just feels like it's never gonna end and it's just

00:08:02.10 like any time I move the scab on my knee cracks and it's excruciating

00:08:05.23 and so the whole left side of my body is pretty sore um I don't know if it's

00:08:10.01 Gavin sore but it's pretty [ __ ] sore um it was compounded by the fact that I

00:08:15.04 don't know if this had happened yet but you know I was having having the dudes

00:08:18.11 come in and work on the house uh fixing up the bedroom and uh I may have even

00:08:23.04 made a joke about how I thought it was gonna take like two days and it was

00:08:26.12 probably gonna take much longer well I moved back into my bedroom last night

00:08:30.23 which was wonderful but um I underestimated

00:08:34.04 how difficult my life would be being kicked out of my own bedroom for a week

00:08:39.14 like not able to go in at all uh because it was like a clean room

00:08:44.00 because they were having to like de-texture the ceiling and then re-tape

00:08:48.03 and float and put the whatever the [ __ ]

00:08:51.12 on the ceiling is to smooth it out and it took I mean they were [ __ ] working

00:08:55.02 till like 78910 midnight night for last every night and um

00:08:59.01 they just I just didn't have access to my bedroom which means I didn't have

00:09:02.12 access to my closet I wasn't ready for that I didn't know when the first guy

00:09:06.01 walked in and said hey what's up I'm Dave I got muscles and tattoos and I'm

00:09:09.17 gonna put the trim on your wall I didn't know that from that point on I would

00:09:15.01 have no access to my clothes uh or anything I owned really uh and so I had

00:09:18.23 been living in one pair of shorts two pairs of underwear a pair of socks and

00:09:23.11 three shirts that I just happened to have in my line but you couldn't just

00:09:26.16 nip in there no well no it's my closet it was boarded up like like

00:09:32.17 my whole the whole room uh was taped off very heavily because they did the walls

00:09:37.23 first and then the ceiling and it was it's all been ceiling work since so I it

00:09:43.07 was all like taped off in a way and then like the scaffolding and stuff

00:09:46.18 which is very heavy it's pushed against it so I could nip into the room but I

00:09:50.11 couldn't buy myself move the scaffolding or any of that stuff

00:09:53.16 and so I've just been I've been I've been living like that for a week just

00:09:58.08 doing laundry every night which is fine I can live with that but nip to target

00:10:02.00 and get a few sets of undies yes Geoff is maybe the funniest person to

00:10:05.14 have this happen to you because you have a [ __ ] clothing line you have a whole

00:10:10.03 extensive shirt collection I don't know based around you I gotta start making

00:10:14.09 underwear I gotta start making underwear I have tons of clothes I just didn't

00:10:17.21 have access to them but I did have some stuff in the dirty clothes so I made it

00:10:21.10 work I make I improvise I make it work that's fine I adapt I overcome I was in

00:10:25.11 the military I know how to do it uh but that that like not having access to your

00:10:29.16 stuff also this is gonna sound really lame but uh I have two stress relievers

00:10:34.10 in my life right now that I don't drink I have bicycles out of the question

00:10:38.08 there's no way I can't get on my bike right now so my backup is baseball cards

00:10:43.11 right I play I when I get stressed out I organize my

00:10:46.19 baseball cards I I I sleeve stuff all locked up in the closet no access to any

00:10:51.11 any of that [ __ ] it was all in the closet with the clothes right oh no

00:10:55.14 so I just had no no way to like relieve stress

00:10:58.13 Friday Saturday I was in bed I could barely I couldn't really really get out

00:11:02.10 I had to have my leg elevated it was swollen uh so my whole weekend was

00:11:06.07 basically [ __ ] and then bed I don't know if I I don't know if this had

00:11:09.15 happened yet but we had to move my king size mattress and everything our bed

00:11:13.12 into the library it was the only room in the house we could fit it which is so

00:11:17.01 much you know the shelf room as well right oh yeah yeah well I found out that

00:11:20.04 uh first off the hot this side of the house is unbearably hot uh the air

00:11:23.20 conditioner doesn't work for [ __ ] over here uh

00:11:27.00 and uh I knew that I knew that because they had told me that and they told me

00:11:30.18 it was unfixable because of the way my ceiling is built without ripping out my

00:11:34.10 whole ceiling and now that I have ripped out a ceiling I have no desire to do

00:11:37.22 that again anytime soon let me tell you but I hadn't experienced it uh but now I

00:11:43.09 spend a week living on a mattress on the floor like I'm in college again where

00:11:48.15 like I have to very carefully get out of my side because

00:11:51.20 one inch away from the bed is this desk and this chair and all of this equipment

00:11:56.22 and I sprained my ankle three or four more times just trying to get up to pee

00:12:00.07 in the middle of the night trying to get like through the jenga of this room so

00:12:04.14 like I was in a box incredibly uncomfortable another thing you don't

00:12:08.17 think about when you when you do when you displace yourself in your own home

00:12:12.15 and have complete strangers in your house half of your house uh for eight to

00:12:17.20 twelve hours a day every day for some reason

00:12:21.12 every spot in this house that I could stand or sit or occupy space in has a

00:12:26.15 direct line view to those guys I was what now that they were watching me just

00:12:32.04 like every time I turn around no matter what room I'm in they can see me and I

00:12:35.22 can see them and it's just really discombobulating to feel like even

00:12:39.02 though those guys don't give a [ __ ]

00:12:41.09 about me they're busy doing their job but just to feel like every time I turn

00:12:45.01 around there's dudes I can see people oh like a window away from me and there's

00:12:48.12 nothing I could do about it so I just felt I felt like I was in a fish bowl

00:12:53.09 for a [ __ ] week then uh the night before last god damn I was

00:12:56.14 [ __ ] done with it you know and the guys were like the guys were like it's

00:12:59.17 gonna take another day to do the seal to finish the ceiling it's taking longer

00:13:03.07 than we thought and Emily was like now get it done tonight we got the painter

00:13:06.06 coming in tomorrow that's a whole other thing the guy that did does the trim

00:13:09.11 doesn't do paint the guy that does the ceiling does paints the ceiling but

00:13:12.16 doesn't paint trim so we got to bring in another guy who paints trim I'm pretty

00:13:18.00 sure I'm in some sort of a like uh scam but whatever it's fine you do

00:13:22.04 what you got to do in Austin to get people into your house to fix stuff

00:13:25.19 because every house in Austin is under construction and if anybody that's been

00:13:29.06 in Austin and has driven through a na the one block of the neighborhood can

00:13:32.12 see that every house in Austin is under construction right now so it's like it's

00:13:36.04 it's you just you gotta this was like these were like the 20th people we we

00:13:39.11 tried to get to even come in to do this

00:13:41.07 job so it's like [ __ ] it whatever we'll

00:13:43.05 hire the third guy to paint the trim and thank god he did because he was lovely

00:13:47.09 and a Boston celtics fan but anyway so I was ready to go about like nine o'clock

00:13:50.21 night before last and uh we have these giant picture windows in the library

00:13:54.12 that look right into the picture windows in the bedroom and I and those guys

00:13:57.11 Emily wouldn't let them leave until they finished they didn't finish till after

00:14:01.01 midnight and so I just and I couldn't like I'm not gonna lay in my bed in

00:14:05.02 front of them and try to go to sleep so I was kept awake which really sucked

00:14:10.13 too so I've just been like uh I guess you would describe it as

00:14:14.12 depressed I don't know um Emily made sure I saw my therapist this week uh she

00:14:18.22 said I wasn't doing well um but that's not all the bad stuff uh so all that has

00:14:23.14 just been put that's that's put me in a state yeah a bit of a low the jock itch

00:14:28.17 persists oh no it's never it got so bad I contacted the doctor

00:14:33.03 this morning and I'm like listen I I tried two different rounds of pills

00:14:37.19 with you guys two different kinds of creams I'm still getting cream as a

00:14:41.23 matter of fact I ran out of the cream you gave me but I had a refill so I just

00:14:45.11 filled it myself and kept going I'm trying to to be patient with this thing

00:14:49.05 but like is there what like what else can we do

00:14:52.09 and they were like keep at it put more cream on

00:14:56.10 did you tell them it might be some sort of virus from the lake [Laughter]

00:15:01.14 I mean I went there and physically showed it to him the doctor looked at it

00:15:05.20 and he goes like yeah like that's that's

00:15:08.01 jock itch that's tinia as it's called um

00:15:09.22 but they're kicking they kick it they're

00:15:11.19 kicking my itch can down the road so I'm pretty like the left side of my body is

00:15:15.22 inflamed and exhausted and every time I stand up or sit down I crack a scab and

00:15:20.17 the yellow pus drips out and then it has to move

00:15:23.01 and it's just it's just brutal and then the right side of my body is on fire

00:15:28.04 and so I'm just incredibly uncomfortable in my own skin and then last night we

00:15:31.22 moved back into the room and it was like four hours of lift and heavy furniture

00:15:37.05 and so today I woke up to just every bit of arthritis in my body was

00:15:42.00 mad at me and so like I could barely stand because of my spine it just

00:15:45.12 [ __ ] sucked and uh Emily says she can tell when I'm not doing well because

00:15:48.18 then she'll walk in a room and I just have my head in my hands and I don't

00:15:52.09 realize I'm doing that but oh my god she said that every time she walks in her

00:15:55.23 room I have my head in my hands which is why she was like be sure to go to

00:15:59.02 therapy this week and talk about this so I did um but all that that's

00:16:03.08 out of all that you know we've got the the Geoff's body falling apart bike rick

00:16:07.12 what would be one other classic thing that happens to me that we could throw

00:16:11.02 into the mix house is clearly an issue hmm I'll let you guess real quickly and

00:16:15.22 then if nobody's gonna get it I'll just uh a baseball card fire baseball card

00:16:19.22 fire that never happens that you're not gonna get a replacement for

00:16:23.13 fridge is a fridge is a great one I'll just uh I picked up Millie from school

00:16:28.00 Monday we needed to go to the grocery store and uh so I'm like okay so

00:16:33.02 head up to the grocery store stop at the stoplight before the grocery store bam

00:16:38.14 rear ended come on bam rear-ended I got [ __ ] rear-ended oh less than a month

00:16:44.06 after I got my car back from when I [ __ ] it up and then they took it to

00:16:48.09 get a certified and then they got into an accident I get rear-ended again which

00:16:52.09 is still less than like six months from when Millie got rear-ended my car's been

00:16:57.20 in three accidents this year what does everyone have against my car

00:17:02.04 I have no I [ __ ] dia dude I mean my car's drivable but it's all

00:17:06.10 [ __ ] up in the back and I got to go through this process again where the

00:17:11.02 only place that'll fix my my kind of car they still get certified by bmw is 40

00:17:16.02 minutes away and you got to go down there and take the car to them and then

00:17:19.14 they'll evaluate it and then they won't let you leave it there then you got to

00:17:23.12 go back home and wait two weeks for them to I'm in that process again and I was

00:17:29.14 so [ __ ] excited to be done and have a [ __ ] healthy car again to now

00:17:34.02 immediately be starting at scratch all over again I still haven't even been

00:17:39.00 able to still go with the insurance it's not even been able to take it to get

00:17:43.05 evaluated to see how much it's gonna cost to repair I'm so [ __ ] done with

00:17:49.07 this life oh my god that is an endless stream of [ __ ]

00:17:52.09 this might be the worst week ever on face that we've heard from you it's like

00:17:56.23 groundhog's day man I just I don't know I don't know and and

00:18:00.16 I'll be honest with you there's a little bit of there's a little bit of joy in

00:18:03.18 here in your misery gav and it would probably would have felt a little better

00:18:06.17 if Andrew had something bad happen too because then it's like you know misery

00:18:10.13 loves company yeah I'm a pretty miserable guy but uh

00:18:14.12 god now I'm just imagining you in the front seat of your smashed in car with

00:18:20.06 your head in your heads yeah yeah yeah yeah I'm just like did it hurt uh

00:18:24.20 nah I was it was I mean I had a headache or Millie had a headache I had a sore

00:18:28.08 neck but but it was fine um was this something that was nothing [ __ ] on their

00:18:31.14 phone no I felt so bad it was one of like I'm

00:18:34.23 pretty sure it was one of millie's high school classmates she was a kid she was

00:18:39.04 really sweet and terrified and I felt bad for I ended up spending

00:18:42.17 trying to comfort her I'm like listen this is your first accident and she's

00:18:46.01 like I'm like you see your car your parents cards like it's my car my

00:18:49.09 parents pay for it I'm like that's okay and then she's like you know I'm like

00:18:52.12 are you you're not hurt I'm not hurt we can both drive away this is like if

00:18:55.23 you're going to get into an accident this is the first accident to get it

00:19:00.08 yeah don't worry my car gets rear-ended once a month this happens to me six

00:19:04.01 seven times a year apparently so yeah sign my book of people who have

00:19:08.17 rerated me this year yeah uh this is my car wreck book yeah just

00:19:12.23 like read a little note maybe you know so that I'm I'm

00:19:17.05 I'm feeling I'll be honest with you guys

00:19:20.23 I'm feeling kind of defeated right now I

00:19:23.11 love the idea of like a hotel guest book

00:19:25.15 for your car and everyone is just like a bunch of blank lines and you just get

00:19:29.10 people to sign in every time they hit you I think it's a problem of space

00:19:33.06 though there's no book big enough that could fit the volume that Geoff gets hit

00:19:38.17 we're gonna constantly be needing new paper all these dates and names there are

00:19:43.20 demolition derby vehicles that have had less impact than your car Gavin but it

00:19:49.01 is ridiculous my car has been hit through no fault of its own three times

00:19:54.15 this year three [ __ ] times this year how is that possible oh that's a lot

00:20:00.00 that's an excessive amount yeah it's like we're magnetized to [ __ ] oh

00:20:04.13 so anyway it sucks okay that's my update

00:20:06.23 so to put a positive spin you're back in your room yeah I I slept in my own

00:20:10.13 bedroom last night it was wonderful and the room that's good is [ __ ] gorgeous

00:20:13.17 I'll send you guys a picture it looks like let's see let's see a picture like

00:20:18.02 a post shelf picture yeah it's here you go I I let me see if I took any I did

00:20:23.12 okay here oh that looks so cool yeah that's worth it is that the best picture

00:20:28.15 that Geoff has ever taken it it looks like honestly a photo of a five-star hotel

00:20:34.01 room that is like the executive suite yeah did you take that photo I did I did

00:20:39.03 I did why that's what happens when I try to take a

00:20:41.18 photo I will say I'm I genuinely impressed by your photo taking skills

00:20:45.07 yeah that's something that you've got on the on the wide lens yeah it's on the

00:20:49.01 point five or whatever the only thing is

00:20:51.07 I didn't take the laundry off the little bench in front of the bed before I took

00:20:54.21 it so it's let's get you excuse me but I was just excited to have laundry

00:20:56.13 anyway so that's what my bedroom looks like yeah I don't know if you can really

00:21:00.00 see the the stuff on the walls but it's all like

00:21:02.12 painted the same color the ceilings pin the same color yeah it's it is worth it

00:21:06.07 it is worth it oh it's totally it's totally worth it I'm scrolling up to the

00:21:09.21 the photo you took before it looks like an entirely different room it's amazing

00:21:14.00 how much was it those choices you did made I'm really jealous that's

00:21:18.17 awesome yeah that looks great thank you so much uh and thank you to the s the

00:21:23.09 the fleet of people that are required to to do that like the seven different

00:21:27.12 companies or whatever we had to hire yeah I mean you know that so that that

00:21:31.09 part's nice at least now I'm convalescing uh and in my my bed in my space

00:21:36.22 and uh I I do appreciate that um also man this [ __ ] I first off a lot of

00:21:41.16 people coming a lot of people approached me this week telling us we owe andrew's

00:21:45.17 mom an apology [Laughter]

00:21:47.11 [Music]

00:21:48.13 We record these pretty far in advance fyi uh we had already recorded the

00:21:53.20 follow-up episode to this when this when

00:21:57.12 last week's episode hit the extra medium and the end cap episode hit so

00:22:02.12 Andrew and I both had already changed our minds

00:22:05.09 and agreed with Gavin uh in the previous the audience hasn't even heard the

00:22:08.17 episode yet and we've definitely apologized to andrew's mom at this point

00:22:12.12 um yeah boy we're getting hammered pretty hard so

00:22:16.01 and also also turns out nobody agreed with us everybody's on gavin's side

00:22:21.00 almost everybody is on gavin's side someone came up with it with their own

00:22:25.01 grid just from my description and it's pretty much the exact same as mine

00:22:29.06 except vertical and it looks nicer yeah Eric you must be livid yeah Gavin gotta

00:22:33.12 say I'm not thrilled [Laughter]

00:22:36.18 [Music]

00:22:38.02 I mean it's really shocking when you're right

00:22:41.12 you know you're right and then you have to like really put into perspective

00:22:47.13 how many people can be wrong in the world at one time uh

00:22:51.09 it's really kind of sad I feel sad for them uh frequently embarrassed for them

00:22:57.09 that they would be this wrong um I think that's really kind of what it

00:23:02.00 boils down to is uh you know you got to get out there and

00:23:05.22 and do your best every day um you know it's it's a team effort and uh

00:23:09.18 you know it's uh it's not it's not an individual thing it's it's just you know

00:23:13.12 you can't you can't let the chatter get to you you have to go out and just play

00:23:16.15 the game the best that you can and and do what you can every time so have you

00:23:20.13 thought about maybe just opening the mind maybe seeing what all the fuss is

00:23:24.12 about yeah yeah again Gavin it's like I said um it's you gotta get out there and

00:23:30.02 you can't let the naysayers and detractors get at you you know you gotta go out

00:23:35.06 there and do what you know is best and and do

00:23:38.10 what you believe in your heart and uh and just play the game you know how uh

00:23:41.23 that's I think that's the important part we I I by the way last week you were

00:23:45.12 saying how um because we obviously threw this in the merch chat for a discussion

00:23:48.22 and you were saying that the only person who agreed with me in there was maxie

00:23:53.06 right um yeah that actually wasn't the case right it's pretty sad to see you

00:23:57.15 know again I gotta go out and say it's pretty sad to see so how many people are

00:24:00.18 wrong how many people you've respected in your life and uh again there's a lot

00:24:04.21 of chatter and there's a lot of people saying a lot of things but it's not up

00:24:08.08 to them uh you know it's um it's just uh frankly it's tough it's

00:24:12.17 tough when you think that uh everyone's got your best interests at heart and

00:24:16.06 they don't and uh they're wrong the whole time so it's pretty rough sometimes

00:24:21.10 sometimes it happens with your own family like when your wife says so

00:24:25.07 what's this extra medium thing and then you explain it and she goes no and then

00:24:30.17 and now you're betrayed you know just on like a marital level so it's um

00:24:35.02 it's difficult uh what we skipped by in in the merch chat last week was we we

00:24:40.13 said that maxey agreed to me of course but also tony wrote

00:24:44.20 extra medium I guess would be mathematically exactly the measurement

00:24:48.17 between small and large right yeah and he'd be wrong about that which is really

00:24:52.12 like the tough part of the whole thing you know what I mean

00:24:55.10 is that you know because we like those leave it up to yeah that's the thing we

00:25:01.11 like tony and and it's really hard just to see him be that wrong

00:25:04.18 uh the whole time especially from a merch standpoint you know what I mean

00:25:07.22 like this is the guy we're trusting with the face with the face brand yeah you

00:25:11.17 know what you know what's great about this conversation we've had it four

00:25:16.13 times no it gives me a unique perspective of this

00:25:20.07 is what it must have been like to listen to me say I never said I would eat a

00:25:24.18 pencil is what just happened to watch somebody just be so clearly wrong and

00:25:29.20 everybody being against it but an unwillingness to move in the slightest

00:25:35.07 this has been a great exercise for me what a what a crazy time that was

00:25:40.10 in your defense Eric can I say in commiseration and I've said this before

00:25:43.20 and I'll say it again I feel dirty I don't I don't like I don't like what's

00:25:48.11 happened I don't like that my opinion has changed I feel like there's

00:25:53.07 something wrong in me that makes me agree with Gavin and I don't

00:25:58.02 I don't respect Gavin or his opinion so it's really

00:26:02.12 it's like it's it sucks dude it's like there's a like

00:26:05.07 I'm not doing good internally just trying to trying to get over this I get what

00:26:09.12 you're saying that it's like on a personal level you know now just imagine

00:26:14.06 that's just like a million-fold where you just have to

00:26:18.00 see that in everyone else and just and you're embarrassed frankly for all of

00:26:22.06 those people and it's it's really sad for them to

00:26:25.05 live in a world where that's what they think extra medium is nick said this is

00:26:29.00 eric's pencil but he doesn't have to eat

00:26:30.22 a shirt that's true I never committed to eating anything and I think that's

00:26:34.11 probably what's gonna let me off here it sounds as though if I'd have asked

00:26:38.00 anyone else at the company for an extra medium I would have been given a medium

00:26:43.09 so I'm really you know unlocked out with who I asked

00:26:46.12 and I think that's the solace that I have in all of this is that people go

00:26:50.10 right but it's Gavin why did he ask that way and I'm like right no I understand

00:26:55.07 oh man speaking of does it do I guess it's come

00:26:58.10 out at this point I hope yes it is we'll have the the premiere will have been I

00:27:03.22 mean at the point of this recording it's tomorrow but um it'll the first two

00:27:07.23 episodes will be out by the time this episode is out um so we'll take a

00:27:12.19 break and then record some more we had a great meeting to come up with like the

00:27:16.07 rest of the season like a great meeting about that so I'm excited to do more

00:27:20.11 does it do yeah it was it felt like maybe a preview of uh of what office day

00:27:25.03 is gonna be like tomorrow because tomorrow's our first office day as well

00:27:30.04 and it was me Eric and Andrew Gavin didn't show for some reason but uh we

00:27:33.19 went through what was on your calendar I assume when was that Tuesday we did the

00:27:37.22 meeting it's Tuesday Tuesday from one to two years calendar yeah we talked about

00:27:42.04 it uh in the last recording uh we scheduled it and everything you were

00:27:45.17 there uh but it was like it was like one

00:27:47.18 of the most fruitful meetings we've ever

00:27:49.22 had we went through all the products for the rest of the season and we came up

00:27:54.02 with all the props and all the tests and everything and I'm I'm

00:27:57.11 I was excited about does it do before just with the idea of when I came up

00:28:00.16 with it and then I was really excited after we filmed the first two episodes

00:28:04.23 uh more so episode two than one except that two was stronger but I'm way more

00:28:08.19 excited now because the stuff that like that we were coming up with together was

00:28:13.17 so much better it's so funny I I'm really excited to get back in there and

00:28:17.22 film again so that meeting has haunted me yeah in an unexpected way Geoff yeah I

00:28:23.09 talked to Gavin that evening okay and I talked to him about the meeting and I

00:28:27.13 said uh we had a meeting today we're talking about things for the show how it

00:28:31.18 do what and then he corrected me and I was so embarrassed and I'm still living

00:28:36.11 in that embarrassment I haven't stopped thinking about the fact that I said how

00:28:42.17 it do as the show name to him yeah so it is yeah it was so bad

00:28:48.21 I feel so bad about it how old are you what was going on with your brain there

00:28:54.10 I don't know maybe I think there's a graphic in the first one or how it works

00:28:59.09 mate I don't know it was just my brain was somewhere else yeah I don't know I

00:29:04.11 don't know where it was but it was bad it was an embarrassing moment that I

00:29:09.03 haven't been able to stop thinking about how it do

00:29:13.14 well I haven't thought about it since 10

00:29:15.17 seconds after you said it but I'm glad it's been awarding you no I yeah it's I

00:29:19.23 knew I know it's one of those literally it's all I've been thinking about for

00:29:25.12 two days constantly how it do what an idiot

00:29:27.23 so tomorrow is our uh is our office day first office day is everybody gonna show

00:29:32.20 up or is everybody gonna be there what time is that I mean right now we were

00:30:03.18 adjustment to the calendar invite fantastic I'm excited I don't know

00:30:06.13 what's what that's gonna bring but I'm excited for it did you guys see this uh

00:30:10.10 image on Instagram the other day Emily showed no I said it in the slack it's uh

00:30:15.12 somebody naked person in the background I mean I think it's somebody who's

00:30:18.21 probably wearing shorts but uh it's somebody sent it to the face Instagram

00:30:23.22 and it's uh somebody named Elizabeth and uh it

00:30:27.12 appears that they got a go go now tattoo on their finger

00:30:31.06 which that's awesome we were so excited about um

00:30:34.17 Emily me uh Tamara and gogo now joey uh are all gonna go get that tattoo we're

00:30:41.03 all gonna go get that tattoo on our fingers together uh to commemorate the

00:30:45.00 event we're pretty excited are you gonna

00:30:45.14 do it on the same finger yeah I think so I got roommates I think so I don't know

00:30:49.12 I feel like it should be on the on the index I was going to say yeah like a

00:30:52.16 pointer finger yeah it's like it should be the finger the point it's like

00:30:55.18 getting a move on yeah let's go go now go here pointing oh yeah I can do that

00:30:59.17 that's a good point I well maybe they were looking to hide it a little bit

00:31:03.07 more but that's fair I'm I'm all about I mean there's no hiding my tattoos so

00:31:07.01 yeah I'll get it on my index finger for sure that's a great point was is that

00:31:10.05 the middle finger that they did it on I think so because I respect that too I

00:31:13.19 guess like go go now [ __ I yourself yeah that's that's the different

00:31:17.13 instruction yeah exactly I really like it on the middle finger yeah maybe keep

00:31:20.17 it in the middle good point I think no matter what finger you put it on it

00:31:23.17 works it's a great it's a fantastic tattoo anyway so I just wanted to

00:31:27.13 shout out to Elizabeth for getting that tattoo and uh just so you know we're all

00:35:54.23 I had an interesting thing happen that I feel like I need I feel like I need to

00:36:00.15 tell the story because there's a possibility that somebody could have

00:36:05.12 this happen to them it was a fascinating it was a few days ago just a normal

00:36:11.12 night I got a call from my mom she said hi

00:36:13.21 uh there's something wrong with the tv can you come can you come fix this I was

00:36:18.10 like well what's going on what's wrong because I assume if it's broken to the

00:36:22.07 point where she's calling I'm assuming I'm not gonna be able to fix it because

00:36:25.23 she's not tech savvy but it's not you know it's an extreme call yeah she's

00:36:30.14 like I don't want to talk about this over the phone you have to come over

00:36:34.10 here you have to fix this oh no and I said okay so I went to her place

00:36:39.01 and I look at the tv and as soon as I look at the tv I'm greeted with an image

00:36:45.02 of the Vancouver child kicker skateboard in my closet and I'm I'm thinking like

00:36:50.16 what how did what is going on how did this happen

00:36:54.02 I was expecting it to just be like a pixel issue why is a photo I took

00:36:59.04 on this television and so I said what were you doing on on

00:37:03.03 the tv and she said I was watching Disney plus I said okay

00:37:07.21 so you're on and then I put all the pieces together what had happened was

00:37:11.17 for Christmas I bought her an amazon fire stick because she wasn't able to

00:37:14.23 watch Disney plus and she wanted to watch only murders in the building so

00:37:18.02 she watches Disney plus through the fire stick I got an email maybe like two or

00:37:23.18 three months ago from amazon saying hey we have like amazon photos if you use

00:37:29.20 our app we'll give you a 15 gift card so

00:37:32.14 I signed up for that and when I I signed up it immediately just

00:37:36.23 transferred all of my camera roll onto their service oh so

00:37:42.04 so then I'm piecing together oh so so this is so it's my cam it must be the

00:37:47.08 amazon photo thing so I said how did this happen she said well I got up to

00:37:51.00 use the bathroom and I came back and all these photos were on the screen

00:37:55.13 and the first photo that appeared when she came back was a photo of my driver's

00:38:00.00 license because I guess I took a photo to sign up for like a medical app or

00:38:04.03 like a coveted thing in the past right like send in a government id to register

00:38:08.19 for it she thought that her tv was like hacked

00:38:12.01 by anonymous she thought that this was a deep that's why she didn't want to

00:38:15.08 tell me over the phone she thought it was like an enemy of the state like

00:38:19.08 somebody had hacked yeah she she was convinced because it was like all these

00:38:23.18 personal photos and I have never been more relieved that

00:38:27.00 my camera roll was filled with just things that make me laugh because I

00:38:30.10 could just see in my head for certain people how disastrous this could have

00:38:35.11 been so I sorted out I turned off the screen saver mode for it went into amazon

00:38:40.17 photos got rid of my my camera roll deleted everything but I just a warning

00:38:44.06 to people if you have amazon photos and there's somebody in your life that

00:38:48.20 is using your amazon account through a stick or whatever

00:38:52.12 just be aware just be cautious because that could be

00:38:55.14 that could be such a bad scenario catastrophic for you it could have been

00:39:01.05 disastrous we we have that we have one of those little

00:39:05.14 like uh amazon uh like Alexa tv things in the kitchen

00:39:08.10 and uh we set that up to so that we could put like Emily wanted to put like

00:39:13.14 photos of the dogs and stuff will dog now and stuff in there and uh when she

00:39:17.23 left after the first day she set it up I just filled it with pictures of her

00:39:21.18 sleeping with her mouth open that I've taken [Laughter]

00:39:26.02 so then she did the same so now if you ever come to my house just look at the

00:39:30.16 screen saver on the amazon because it's just us [ __ ] with each other uh

00:39:35.11 trying to one-up each other with more embarrassing things

00:39:39.14 oh that's fantastic oh that's great well I'm glad gene

00:39:42.12 hack man's not trying to hack your mom is that a good movie enemy of the state

00:39:46.23 yeah I haven't seen it in such a long time I mean I haven't seen it since it

00:39:50.13 came out but I remember enjoying it were you having to quickly think of all the

00:39:53.22 stuff in your camera roll like the moment you saw that on there were you

00:39:58.02 just like in a panic like how am I no like I I kind of I as I said my I know

00:40:02.04 what my camera roll is it's just it's 99 things that made me

00:40:05.22 laugh and then like the occasional picture of like face merch that they're

00:40:09.21 like said to a family member or something being like look at this this

00:40:13.12 is cool like a boy's a zimmer type thing yeah um yeah no I was more relieved it

00:40:18.04 wasn't me processing what was there it was the relief of knowing that there was

00:40:23.11 nothing I would be embarrassed about on that camera

00:40:27.12 it was a huge sense of relief it was like winning a thing that you didn't

00:40:30.16 know you entered it was great.

00:40:33.07 I just felt it was important to share because I could there's so many versions

00:40:37.17 in a weird way it was almost disappointment that it wasn't more

00:40:41.03 embarrassing what was on the screen because it would be a funnier story mine

00:40:45.18 would have had a bunch of pictures of my ass

00:40:48.19 bruise as I've been tracking it slowly change shape

00:40:52.02 what's the current shape oh it's pretty much gone okay well don't worry buddy

00:40:55.09 we're filming does it do again pretty soon could I do it from like can I sit

00:41:00.04 down you cannot flop all over the goddamn place if you want yeah

00:41:05.05 every every one of those spills you took was 100 self-imposed yep oh 100

00:41:12.19 real dumb and impressive that one where you kicked the tv that was very good

00:41:18.04 I don't even think the bad one was in episode one I think the bad ones in

00:41:23.01 episode two yeah it was in episode two it was during the race

00:41:25.23 yeah when I thought I was I was so s when I heard you hit I was so convinced

00:41:30.08 I was gonna turn around and see your like wrist snapped in half

00:41:33.08 oh god man I've been thinking this game it hurts so much more after

00:41:36.23 than it did at the time as well like it kind of hurt at the time because I was

00:41:40.19 like but the pain went away and then just later that night I was just like

00:41:45.05 I uh I've been thinking about um I've been thinking about uh getting into

00:41:50.05 downhill mountain biking what no yeah yeah I've been thinking

00:41:54.23 about it pretty seriously um absolutely not that sounds like a terrible idea my

00:41:58.23 therapist does downhill mountain biking and I've been thinking about it for a

00:42:02.14 long time and I I got I got I got really kind of keyed up on it the idea last

00:42:06.05 week to the point where I was even looking at bikes and there's a place

00:42:09.05 called spider mountain up northwest of here that I thought I could go try that

00:42:12.08 has like a ski lift and stuff and I was figuring like I'm not trying

00:42:15.12 to hit like 20 foot jumps or anything but I could hit some like six seven foot

00:42:19.04 jumps and I you know in my older age I can like I could take like the I don't

00:42:22.18 know like the blue line down not the black diamond or whatever I figured I

00:42:27.09 could probably handle that clearly uh not today um I need to recover a little

00:42:31.05 bit first but I was I I finally I've been kind of hiding it but I kind of I

00:42:35.03 decided to admit it to Emily that I was seriously thinking about doing this and

00:42:39.14 uh you know looking to get get into that

00:42:43.00 and she she was like I'm gonna show you a photo she was like just yesterday I I

00:42:48.17 was cutting one of my clients hair and he showed me his arm and on his arm were

00:42:55.16 five giant scars like giant scars and I asked like what in the hell happened his

00:42:59.12 uh his like he went on vacation he went up to like I don't know somewhere where

00:43:03.15 they have mountain biking Zion or somewhere and uh decided by himself he

00:43:08.03 was gonna like get into mountain biking same thing as me like dude probably in

00:43:12.00 his 40s or something uh just saw some tick tocks thought it looked cool

00:43:15.20 and uh it was like wife was out of town or something so he just said like I'm

00:43:19.07 gonna have a trip by myself I'm gonna go up and do something I want to do

00:43:20.17 and uh she showed me a photo of him above the hill smiling and waving at the

00:43:25.09 selfie and then she showed me a picture of an

00:43:28.09 arm that I [ __ ] you not looked like an accordion

00:43:33.09 oh god god his arm was in it went like it went like

00:43:37.03 it went like from the elbow up like maybe three inches and then to the right

00:43:42.02 and then far to the left and then to the right and then back to the left again

00:43:45.08 and then there was a wrist the dude broke his arm in so many different

00:43:49.07 places it was like they had it was like they were doing like

00:43:52.11 experimental surgery to fix it because nobody ever [ __ ] their arm up that bad

00:43:56.10 and he was by himself and he uh he had to drive like I don't

00:43:59.21 know 20 miles a car with a accordion arm to get to a hospital and so

00:44:04.10 that's slowing me down a little bit but uh

00:44:07.14 yeah I don't yeah can we vote on this now yeah I mean it's a unanimous no you

00:44:12.17 shouldn't do that I don't get how you have a session

00:44:16.18 and your entire point of session is that everything in your body is broken and

00:44:21.04 the walk away point is maybe I should get into downhill mountain biking yeah I

00:44:25.22 don't understand how that gets suggested uh well it didn't get suggested I

00:44:29.15 suggested it I see and they're like yeah I've known for a while my therapist

00:44:34.20 mountain bikes um it's something we talk

00:44:37.16 about sometimes we both love bicycles so

00:44:40.10 it's like a common point of conversation

00:44:42.21 on occasion I still think I'm still that definitely slowed me down that and my

00:44:46.01 knee have and my ankle have definitely slowed no I don't want to mountain bike

00:44:50.12 with my therapist I just want a mountain bike

00:44:53.22 but I yeah I uh I'm still considering it I don't know

00:44:57.16 thanks for the feedback uh okay I'll tell you that you guys are on the fence

00:45:00.20 I want to throw some weight on this to slow you down further so the accordion

00:45:06.12 arm guy right he crashed had to drive now imagine in that drive you're gonna

00:45:10.08 be in 25 car accidents from point a to point b so you need to factor that into

00:45:15.09 the paint this is not you you're the least you're

00:45:18.10 the least not qualified isn't the right word but you are the the like the the

00:45:22.09 number one not candidate for doing this but you should be at the bottom of the

00:45:26.04 list that's how I'll get to the ambulance faster [Laughter]

00:45:30.16 Geoff I want us I want to side with you I think you should give it a shot like

00:45:35.09 thanks man yeah man so we are hitting baseballs tomorrow or not no I don't

00:45:41.05 think oh okay and that was because of oh I'm still pretty I'm still okay I

00:45:45.12 honestly so is a curb that okay no I still say yes I'm still gonna go yeah

00:45:49.13 yeah but there's there's not gonna be any curbs on the mountain you're gonna

00:45:53.09 be like Geoff Kent is what's gonna happen you're not gonna be able to hit

00:45:56.16 baseballs because you broke your wrist doing wheelies on a bike

00:46:01.07 this is a disaster your baseball career is being impacted by this it would be a

00:46:06.06 disaster if this ended my baseball career but to be fair we could end up

00:46:09.16 with a new bike jumps done out of this I think we will would we'll we'll see I

00:46:14.06 don't know I'm not in a hurry to get back on my on my bike on the street

00:46:17.20 right now so we could potentially watch an arm become an accordion in slow

00:46:22.17 motion I don't want to see that in slow motion I don't either oh man [Laughter]

00:46:28.10 my best friend in the army when he was in high school he was a big skateboarder

00:46:34.23 and uh oh god he oh no he was he was filming uh like skatepark

00:46:38.12 skateboard parts with his friends uh when he was like 16. And he like I don't

00:46:43.02 know what he did I don't remember what the trick trick was I think it was just

00:46:46.21 like a like a rail grind or something it wasn't crazy it wasn't even down steps

00:46:50.00 or anything it wasn't like a flat rail uh but he like he slipped and landed

00:46:53.11 wrong and he snapped his arm in half his and uh from about I would say about

00:46:58.06 halfway up the up the forearm and so it was like and there's a video he showed

00:47:01.20 me in the army of him screaming and holding his arm and running around in a

00:47:05.00 circle not knowing what to do while his arm was just like flopping around in

00:47:08.04 every different direction uh before I guess they stopped filming oh that's

00:47:12.21 terrible yeah no that was um that was a mtv show when I

00:47:17.05 was growing up was it scarred mtv scars

00:47:22.12 it was just yeah the only thing I remember I was always too scared to

00:47:26.12 watch it but I remember watching it a little bit I remember there was one

00:47:31.01 where a guy was like grinding down a rail and then he fell and the rail had

00:47:36.21 like a slice lip at like the edge of it and he like cut his ball sack open on

00:47:40.17 impact like it was that was bad it's a bad show oh there's a shirt that's hard

00:47:44.17 to believe that was just on tv like middle of the day how could that be

00:47:48.12 televised I don't know I never I was too scared to watch it so I don't maybe it

00:47:51.23 wasn't as graphic maybe it was like all they would like lead in and like explain

00:47:55.20 it but not show anything but it was just not it was not what I was

00:48:00.19 interested in it's terrible there's a line it's where

00:48:03.12 physical comedy becomes not funny at all

00:48:06.01 I feel like wipe out is sort of the sweet spot or jackasses yes is maybe even

00:48:10.16 better I don't know as soon as it's permanent as soon as you

00:48:14.10 watch something permanent happen it's not funny to me yeah

00:48:18.17 that's so weird maybe it shows how poor my priorities are if I'm okay I try to

00:48:23.18 laugh immediately on impact mainly for everybody else

00:48:27.09 like when I I fell out of that share heart immediate laughter just because it

00:48:31.13 it's loud I need everyone notes okay uh I was telling Eric all this [ __ ]

00:48:36.13 earlier in the week we were recording uh one of the other podcasts and uh the

00:48:40.22 Austin one and he told me he was like well you're gonna I guess you're gonna

00:48:45.03 get a root canal next week and let me tell you if I don't show up for face

00:48:48.21 recording next week it's because this is the only way I won't show up for

00:48:53.00 fish recording this week it's because it will be if I wake up Monday or

00:48:56.16 Tuesday morning with a toothache and I find out I do need a root canal I'm

00:49:00.18 going off the grid and nobody will ever see me again I'm just walking away from

00:49:04.01 this life I'm just gonna walk away I'm gonna be like the incredible I'm gonna

00:49:08.00 be like I'm gonna be like bill Bixby at the end of the an episode of incredible

00:49:11.09 hulk I'm just gonna walk away and then or like what's his face carradine in

00:49:14.15 kung fu you'll never see me again that's it that's my exit from this life I just

00:49:19.00 I will quit I will throw up on my hands and quit you an appointment next week

00:49:22.17 for that for a root canal no I'm just saying like are you going to the dentist

00:49:25.23 no I got nothing I got nothing okay but it's like if if you had a left field

00:49:30.08 yeah no it's just like if this if this trend continues the house problem

00:49:36.06 Geoff falls off his bike [ __ ] ra rash issues but like if it

00:49:39.18 car accident like it's either it's either fridge or root canal and if and

00:49:44.06 if one of the fridge I can live with if root canal happens next week that's it

00:49:47.12 I'm done I'm done I'm that's a wrap on Geoff

00:49:50.13 yeah you're living you're living several of my

00:49:53.16 nightmares I don't know if you ever watched did you see the night of as an

00:49:57.12 hbo miniseries oh about the cab driver yeah I watched that first episode john

00:50:02.10 tuturo is in that and he plays a lawyer and it's like an eight-episode arc and

00:50:05.17 it's about this murder and trying to figure out what happened but there's a

00:50:09.06 subplot through the entire series of he just has a rash that will not go away

00:50:14.21 and it gets progressively worse with stress

00:50:17.01 and it's just this this commentary I don't know how accurate it is but it

00:50:21.00 seemed like dealing with rashes just is the worst thing ever no creams worked

00:50:26.10 none of the pills worked just him bouncing from doctor to doctor not

00:50:30.23 getting any resolution having to go to like weird uh like street vendors to

00:50:35.07 find unorthodox methods of healing you're living my fear of having one of

00:50:40.10 these rashes that just will not go away yeah

00:50:42.12 it's fascinating it's been fascinating to observe this Andrew and I played halo

00:50:48.10 the other night for the first time in a few months and um

00:50:52.15 he said something kind of insane to me was this inhaler was this like post uh

00:50:57.18 podcast I said that you'd hit like you said you'd hit like 320000 gamer

00:51:01.20 score or something oh my god oh are you talking about what we this was a

00:51:05.16 different what we said after the podcast it might have been post podcast yeah

00:51:11.01 and uh and he and Andrew was just like I bet by the end of the year I could get

00:51:16.07 and in my head I'm just filling in I'm like I bet he he thinks he can get 400

00:51:21.12 000 by the end of the year the guy says I bet by the end of the

00:51:26.10 year I could hit a million what so the conversation was what I'm glad that

00:51:30.08 there's a time difference between us because there are times where I have

00:51:34.19 burger confidence burger confidence will often hit at around 1030 p.m for you

00:51:38.21 guys which is not I don't feel comfortable I don't want to disturb you

00:51:42.03 I'm not going to text that time I had this thought where it's like I shouldn't

00:51:45.16 maybe I bet I could hit a million points I should make a bet with Gavin that I

00:51:50.04 could hit a million game or score I'm at

00:51:53.11 like 320000 right now I bet you I could do this and then some time passed I

00:51:57.14 realized nah it's ridiculous there's no way I could do it but then

00:52:00.20 and describing to Gavin this moment of burger confidence I re then believed

00:52:05.09 that I could do it I was back in I was like this seems possible I'm gonna give

00:52:09.16 this a go as soon as we stop recording I loaded up paw patrol it's getting some

00:52:14.02 achievements we're finalizing details it's not it's economically I think I

00:52:19.16 could do it for a game have to beat like six games a day every day until the end

00:52:23.19 of the year yeah well it seems like but like not even you don't need a thousand

00:52:29.03 points per game necessarily I think there are so many probably like 30

00:52:33.14 minute 600 point games it's a cost issue

00:52:36.14 I was willing to take the bet like if it was going to be 400000 I would have

00:52:40.22 been like yeah you know I mean I maybe put like 500 bucks into that bet he said

00:52:45.03 a million I was like I'll give you ten thousand dollars if you do that and then

00:52:49.05 he was trying to he was trying to figure out what he would what he would have to

00:52:53.16 do if he didn't make it and I just suggested

00:52:57.08 uh run the marathon and he was like no [Laughter]

00:53:03.12 so your conversation with Gavin like rehydrated your burger confidence

00:53:08.02 essentially how many so we have a friend named ray

00:53:11.07 who used to work with us who has a pretty pretty lofty gamer score has he

00:53:16.01 hit a million yet oh he's going I think

00:53:18.06 he's over two million oh okay well [ __ ]

00:53:21.07 maybe you can do it I just found it so funny that he wasn't

00:53:24.22 even the first person to hit a million gamer score who has the name rey

00:53:29.10 yeah that's pretty funny we met that other dude right

00:53:32.10 yeah stallion yeah he's great yeah he's a nice guy yeah I mean

00:53:37.03 I'm inclined to believe you could do it as well it's a [ __ ] lofty goal I

00:53:41.22 think seven hundred seven uh [ __ ] dude [ __ ] four

00:53:44.23 you really think you can I yeah I think you don't think you've blown through all

00:53:49.16 the fast games already no because I stopped doing that like 360 era so I

00:53:54.22 feel like I have all of Xbox one and the

00:53:57.14 current generation to work with I have a few on Xbox one that are like the easy

00:54:01.06 ones but you would never be able to go outside no I don't think it would be as

00:54:05.02 extensive as you think there's a lot of like in an hour get a thousand point

00:54:08.12 games and I haven't done the extensive research to know how many of them there

00:54:12.03 are I could be so wrong and that I think there's hundreds where there isn't but

00:54:16.16 you couldn't even write 20000 things down

00:54:20.00 I don't know what that has to do with anything that's just a side fact

00:54:24.19 so how much gamer score are you going to need I'd need like 680000.680000

00:54:29.18 gamer score and what month this is September so you have five months to get

00:54:36.18 well this was okay this is a week ago

00:54:42.12 since uh well probably coming in on two decades and I've got 95000

00:54:48.12 score yeah I think you kind of suck though I suck though but still

00:54:53.14 that's so much it is a lot I thought Gavin was going to bring up what

00:54:58.22 happened in halo because halo recently added rank doubles and we haven't played

00:55:03.07 in a very long time so I thought oh it'd be fun to do

00:55:06.04 because when it came out we did ranked and that was fun so why don't we do we

00:55:10.13 qualify you have to play 10 games and then you get qualified for your rank

00:55:16.06 uh and it was double specifically which is a new play list we went through the 10

00:55:19.20 games Gavin your previous rank was gold4

00:55:22.13 what is your current rank after playing 10 games where did it place you

00:55:26.21 um can you before he answers can you just go because I haven't done it uh and

00:55:30.23 I imagine a lot of the audience doesn't know what the [ __ ] that means what is

00:55:36.12 the scale so it starts I think bronze is as low as you can go

00:55:40.04 okay and it goes bronze one through five and then silver one through five so is

00:55:44.12 five the highest bronze and then five is

00:55:47.02 the highest bronze it goes in silver one silver one yeah you go through that

00:55:52.21 scale all the way up I think it goes silver gold platinum

00:55:56.02 and then I want to say then it's onyx right I don't think there's a diamond I

00:55:59.11 think platinum and then the highest level is onyx oh it's a platinum maybe

00:56:03.17 there is I don't remember I think you just skipped it because you were onyx

00:56:07.16 once I worked I my first ranking was gold

00:56:11.07 four and then I slow that was the rank it gave me after my ten games and I was

00:56:15.18 slowly able to climb gold five and then I eventually got platinum one was the

00:56:20.03 highest I've been okay and uh here's diamond and last night or the night

00:56:25.09 before I got ranked silva four

00:56:28.15 it's the most disappointed I've ever heard Gavin in my life now yeah I was

00:56:33.22 ready for something shitty but that made me sad do you think that's because of

00:56:39.01 your ankles I don't think so why what? What what do you ascribe your

00:56:44.15 dramatic drop in halo score too not very good [Music]

00:56:50.15 do you think you've gotten worse or did people get better

00:56:54.12 I hope it's the second one.

00:57:01.12 I went up one so last time we did this I was platinum one I got ranked platinum

00:57:06.18 two so I went up one level and Gavin got dropped down an entire class

00:57:14.00 I don't know if if the audience is going to pick up on this but I've known Gavin

00:57:18.12 for a very long time there is so much legitimate pain in the way he said those

00:57:24.02 things like that was there was a lot of really subtle but raw raw emotion

00:57:29.09 in that in fact this is this has got to be you've you must be crestfallen

00:57:36.13 what makes it what makes it even funnier.

00:57:48.13 [Laughter]

00:57:52.02 So you're old your body's falling apart and you suck at halo

00:57:57.07 it's like we're twins so many outs so many outs to say like I was

00:58:04.06 distracted by this or this thing happened or whatever

00:58:15.12 what made it so enjoyable was the fact he had to play 10 games to get that you

00:58:21.14 had to put in so much effort to just be disappointed and insulted

00:58:27.07 oh and this is my it's my favorite game I love hayla

00:58:33.01 I was gonna as a joke delete the game after that happened but then I

00:58:38.06 remembered it's like 120 gig game and I really don't want to read that

00:58:42.10 oh I'm sorry buddy it's uh well you know you probably the

00:58:46.11 hand-eye coordination is probably not what it used to be in your body and uh

00:58:51.05 you know the eyes they as you get older they they lose a little

00:58:54.08 bit of their sharpness so uh all right I'm gonna try and get to gold

00:58:58.04 this week yeah let's let's try to get you there yeah do you think you think

00:59:02.02 that now do you do you think a strict regimen of

00:59:04.21 practice and playing will help or would you would it be easier to build a time

00:59:08.19 machine um yeah it's kind of what I'm thinking too

00:59:12.08 probably more plausible too that's the luck though

00:59:15.18 I really want Andrew to try and get a million before the end of the year

00:59:19.11 though I did financially is like if I was looking at I did a little bit of

00:59:23.20 research and it seemed like some of the easiest games the average price is like

00:59:29.09 ten dollars so I have to buy like 600

00:59:32.02 games I'm looking at 6000 minimum what if we tried to buy like someone's bulk

00:59:36.15 video game collection off eBay like all pre used

00:59:39.08 I think most of these easy gamer score games never had a physical release ah

00:59:43.18 it's a tough thing to work around I'm not opposed to it I could get 400000

00:59:48.12 uh how long could that reasonably take uh Tuesday I think half a million has

00:59:53.11 got to be the goal half a million yeah I think a million is impossible yeah I

00:59:57.21 think a million is half a million I would sneeze at half a million that's

01:00:01.22 easy I could do that no problem yeah and if you don't you have to run the

01:00:05.09 marathon no we never said that that was pretty I mean that was off the table

01:00:10.02 before so wait uh I feel like legitimate bet forming I

01:00:14.00 think yeah I agree there's some half a million half a million gamer score by

01:00:19.12 January 1st uh 2023. Okay you are at what right now

01:00:23.11 I'm at like 328000. So you need you need to get roughly uh 180000.

01:00:31.22 Oh it's so easy between now and which is the equivalent of a

01:00:36.13 how is that 180 games yes 329

01:00:40.19 621

01:00:42.10 currently so you have to you have 100

01:00:45.14 roughly 200 games to do this yeah in five months oh that's that's so easy now

01:00:50.20 what it gav what what are you prepared surely you're not going for the full 10

01:00:54.15 000 for such a paltry gamer scores 500

01:00:57.00 uh half a million what? What what are you prepared to to pony up um I mean what

01:01:01.23 was fair probably like a thousand ah he's going to do it though he's

01:01:06.18 what if it's not money what if it's something

01:01:09.16 I don't know what do you think Audrey I have no idea I feel weird about the

01:01:13.21 I'm not going to request money I do think it's funny that we cut it in half

01:01:18.21 and you cut the amount by 90

01:01:21.01 that was a fascinating move well I was basically I thought I would give 500

01:01:24.19 probability a thousand and then yeah you went 500000 so I just doubled it um

01:01:30.00 I don't know I did offer rights to my gamer tag he said I could

01:01:33.06 pick his new game attack if he does yeah I can't change it unless that was

01:01:37.01 something I put up now that's interesting see I don't like that I

01:01:40.09 don't like the money angle I think it's better if it's punishment or something

01:01:43.15 like that yeah why don't we keep money out of it I have to do something if you

01:01:47.16 do it and you have to let me change your gamer tag if you don't I well then

01:01:51.14 it become I don't know we'll think about it we'll see if we can think of

01:01:55.03 something all right we're in the early stages of this

01:01:58.15 there might be something here what what if Gavin

01:02:02.08 if if you do it Gavin can only wear large shirts for two months no

01:02:07.14 oh that's pretty good no pretty good if I'm buying a hundred and he has to

01:02:13.07 take and he has to take a photo in a large shirt and send it to you every day

01:02:17.13 to prove that he's in a large shirt no dude that's not worth it I think you're

01:02:22.14 underestimating how miserable that's gonna make Gavin specifically probably

01:02:26.12 yeah I just don't that's not a trade I would make okay well listen we can keep

01:02:30.18 keep working uh behind the scenes to figure this out and maybe we can come up

01:02:34.10 with a solution by next uh episode recording but you're running the clock

01:02:38.18 is ticking while we figure out what uh what the reward punishments will be how

01:02:43.09 long have you had Andrew pen ton as a gamer tag uh uh 2008. Okay

01:02:49.11 it's been a while long time quite a long time I would never personally change it

01:02:54.05 well you better uh you better get half a million gamers for them I can't believe

01:02:57.16 that I'm gonna end both of these [ __ ]

01:02:59.16 recordings rushing to play paw patrol that's the the shock of the year

01:03:05.05 well so you're going to be starting before you decided to bet we talked

01:03:09.15 about that the previous time because as Geoff said I'm running low no but I said

01:03:14.23 under the assumption that this will be a thing I need to start getting reps in

01:03:18.23 I'm running out of time we're now in q4

01:03:21.07 is that right oh no that's not true that's not right next month next month's

01:03:24.14 q4 okay maybe it's maybe it starts q4

01:03:27.00 maybe yeah we'll work it out we'll figure it out I think there's something

01:03:30.00 here good deal I think maybe something in person like maybe Gavin has to

01:03:33.22 deliver something to your door or no that doesn't that doesn't move the

01:03:38.09 needle for me Gavin having to leave america get in a plane go all the way to

01:03:42.04 Canada with his busy schedule to then like I don't know clean your bathroom

01:03:46.13 that way yeah like it's a it's an incredible inconvenience and imposition

01:03:51.18 to him yeah let me buy a Hazmat soon [Laughter]

01:03:55.08 I'll schedule a lunch and then I'll get a great I'll get a

01:04:00.02 miss a guilt basket Eric Eric really wants us to stop talking he's told us to
