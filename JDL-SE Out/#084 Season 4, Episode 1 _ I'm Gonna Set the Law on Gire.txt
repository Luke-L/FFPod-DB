00:00:00.03 [Music]

00:00:07.22 [Music]

00:00:15.11 Holy [ __ ] god damn here we are 2022

00:00:18.23 first episode of the year face we just started Andrew you're

00:00:24.10 starting off 2022 with a bang can you believe it's already year three

00:00:29.03 is it no when does year three start uh on the on the second anniversary of

00:00:35.05 faith yeah so episode 104

00:00:39.03 can you believe it's almost year three but we're already three episodes into

00:00:44.08 season three at this point man the time flies computer freeze frozen is this

00:00:49.20 I'm is this a bit I don't can you I don't think we wait can you can you hear

00:00:55.06 me or we hear you and you can you hear us oh yeah it's just frozen my screen is

00:00:59.20 frozen I'm trying to print the law my screen is frozen

00:01:03.07 it's just showing Geoff talking and nobody else lighting up so I thought I

00:01:06.11 froze again this is typically what happens when I disconnect during the show

00:01:11.11 uh are we how many pages of the law have printed

00:01:14.18 out I don't know it's downstairs I'm just assuming I'll just check in on it

00:01:18.08 you just sent the law to a different room and it's just printing away turner

00:01:21.19 is downstairs I don't know what you want from me I don't have a printer up here

00:01:25.14 like I can't send it what am I printing it on in this room if I keep it in this

00:01:28.23 room what am I doing Gavin well I don't know you have a cure right in there so

00:01:32.21 who knows it's true that's a fair point I can't argue that I don't like that I

00:01:36.10 can't see who's talking and when I feel like I'm constantly frozen that's your

00:01:39.20 fault

00:01:44.13 first of all I wasn't saying no to you I

00:01:47.08 agree with you you're right Eric this is oh I'm back we're good never mind we're

00:01:51.08 fine it all froze we're good I want to talk about a thing before I

00:01:55.16 forget because we should have mentioned it last time because it's specific to

00:02:00.11 the one we recorded before I immediately texted Gavin this uh once

00:02:04.13 we we finished I completely misunderstood the turkey sandwich story

00:02:09.16 I don't think I could see I misinterpreted what was going on in

00:02:13.08 that image so badly I said what you were laughing at was

00:02:17.02 potentially funnier than what happened in my story it is quite pop I think you

00:02:21.12 can maybe make the case that my version is funnier but makes absolutely no sense

00:02:26.06 in the logistics of how planes work or or describing so where's that picture do

00:02:30.05 we still have it like yeah you misunderstand the picture so I'm gonna

00:02:34.13 post the photo again revisit

00:02:39.09 how do you misunderstand this I guess I only speaking of Gavin talking about his

00:02:45.12 peripheral vision failing him I feel as though I only used my peripheral vision

00:02:51.14 to fully look at this photo I only looked out.

00:02:57.03 I only looked out your window I never paid I never really I never I circled in

00:03:03.22 a giant red circle man so this is how I experimented the photo

00:03:09.01 and maybe with your peripheral vision you could do the same I was looking at a

00:03:14.07 window and to my right is a wall you're facing a wall that's a wall with a hole

00:03:19.18 wait wait wait wait wait wait wait what what wait what

00:03:24.08 so I interpreted it as like you're sitting at the front of the plane you're

00:03:29.22 at the front of whatever section you're in [Laughter]

00:03:44.21 we've got mice in the pantry

00:03:52.23 how is jack at our discord right now

00:03:58.06 we could so mess with jack because he's not listening yeah

00:04:02.19 we could do something like yes okay and then

00:04:07.22 were you waiting for one of us to have an idea I've had the idea okay.

00:04:21.12 I don't want to type that's the funniest that what a [ __ ] great idea you're a

00:04:26.22 goddamn genius

00:04:30.11 you're the funniest person I've ever met that is the funniest [ __ ] thing I

00:04:36.10 have ever seen in my entire life oh my god.

00:04:40.19 I was gonna post that later but the fact that jack started typing in here was

00:04:46.06 just it made it the perfect time oh my god do you want to explain what you just

00:04:51.11 posted um well I kind of came in out of order actually but I posted um

00:04:56.12 a picture of jack and his car then a picture of his who left Andrew left okay

00:05:03.09 I posted a pic of a picture of jack's car then I posted a picture of jack's

00:05:08.14 car key and then I put an arrow to under

00:05:10.16 his car seat and then I posted a picture of a bag of cocaine

00:05:15.22 and a big picture of jack smiling next to me

00:05:19.16 just so jack has to look at all these pictures and assume that they're somehow

00:05:29.07 because I've been thinking about this but didn't know the timing of it

00:05:34.07 or people would be mad I liked the segment so much I can't take

00:05:38.13 it it's too funny the sequence is great you're definitely

00:05:43.12 telling a narrative that jack is smuggling cocaine.

00:05:51.23 [Laughter]

00:06:00.00 Oh.

00:06:09.22 [Music]

00:06:14.21 The longer jack doesn't respond the funnier it gets now I'm nervous that he's

00:06:21.11 he's gonna be mad

00:06:26.15 that's what makes it so much better

00:06:31.07 next week on face three pounds of cocaine are into my coffee

00:06:41.23 oh man he got a jet out of jail free card he's doing your idea he was inspired

00:06:47.01 inspiration apologies for the very visual gag there to the audience

00:06:51.12 but I assume we can somehow we'll throw it a picture of it on Instagram um

00:06:58.19 the turkey thing I viewed that as a wall

00:07:02.11 you're right okay so which okay go back to this which is the where's the wall so

00:07:07.16 the window in front of you I thought that was a wall

00:07:11.09 and not a window and I thought but it's a window there's a [ __ ] out of

00:07:16.13 it you can see out and listen I understand this is really

00:07:20.19 dumb and I only learned this because I was describing what had happened and

00:07:26.06 nobody knew what I was talking about I assumed I'd created in my head that

00:07:30.04 because of kovid and wanting like distancing that if you had a wall seat

00:07:35.16 they had like a little food hole to put the food through and so in my head

00:07:40.00 your version of the story you're looking

00:07:41.19 out that window and then they shoved the turkey sandwich through the food hole

00:07:45.07 and that's what you got spooked at not that it was just a reflection in the

00:07:49.07 window in front of you

00:07:51.14 you think he's in solitary confinement they're shoving his food through a

00:07:56.13 [ __ ] hole I haven't been on a plane several years

00:08:00.04 at this point I don't know what's going on

00:08:03.12 I had questions too about how this would

00:08:05.10 even work it didn't really make sense in my head but that's how I used to

00:08:10.02 imagining some guy getting blasted by the wind stood out on

00:08:13.22 the wing trying to shove turkey sandwiches into the first class cabin

00:08:19.01 obviously it was not outside I assumed it would be like where the the

00:08:23.18 attendance would be there's a wall and there's the natural barrier sometimes

00:08:27.10 there's a toilet on that wall on the other side of it and I assume that they

00:08:31.20 had a food hole for the wall so you didn't have to be near the person to

00:08:37.07 give them their turkey sandwich so what I was saying about how the

00:08:40.06 reflection and like the optical illusion what I don't understand which part you

00:08:45.01 thought I thought was the plane we do you think I was just looking at

00:08:48.13 someone's hand come through the hole with a turkey sandwich and that looked

00:08:53.16 like a plane all right okay I think you've stumped them oh yeah yeah

00:09:00.04 today is a technical nightmare I went into achievement hunter

00:09:04.19 nothing worked I was there for two hours filmed nothing had to leave are you

00:09:09.14 serious to come home and film my video which is now like being

00:09:13.03 rushed and that broke too no this doesn't work do you think it's you oh

00:09:17.15 yeah too many coincidences right I got good coin luck but technically

00:09:23.18 oh man dude I cannot wait to see how jack

00:09:28.15 handles this it is Gavin that is really the funniest [ __ ] thing to me I don't

00:09:34.20 know why it's just oh god that's the best how long you been holding on to that

00:09:40.10 uh I came up with it last night nice look at you coming up with ideas that's

00:09:45.07 awesome do you think I mean the goal is to make it seem like you

00:09:49.11 didn't plan a bunch of stuff right where it's more spontaneous yeah

00:09:54.23 are you giving a little peer behind the curtain I write it down

00:09:59.01 no I write it down but the way the way I

00:10:02.18 bring it up is often like if it's near a conversation I can just pluck from the

00:10:06.14 list and it seems yeah yeah less like I'm stopping the conversation to come up

00:10:10.06 with something I can totally agree what are you on now well

00:10:16.08 my computer's still frozen I have bits stop printing the law well okay I've

00:10:22.13 stopped I don't well how okay I stopped the print has stopped my computer still

00:10:27.16 frozen I plugged my Xbox headset into my phone

00:10:31.09 I'm now talking into my microphone for recording the show

00:10:35.14 I'm talking into two mics right now but I can hear you through until I unfreez I

00:10:41.09 think I've been froze I think you're okay sorry it sounds like it sounds like

00:10:47.01 you're calling me from a season one red versus blue recording I made that show

00:10:52.17 I know like one coach yeah okay am I unfrozen I'm unfrozen I'll be I'm going

00:10:57.15 to swap I'm going to swap back I'll do you think be

00:10:59.20 going to have any problems editing this or you think it's just going to be

00:11:03.18 pretty straight and narrow [Laughter]

00:11:06.10 easy-peasy [Laughter]

00:11:10.00 dude [Laughter]

00:11:13.16 2022 is off to a [ __ ] start for nick man oh so oh are you back Andrew

00:11:20.15 I'm good I'm back sorry about that we're all good

00:11:24.12 which part did you hear me ask you about uh some

00:11:27.22 did you did you think I got scared by a guy's hand coming through a hole and not

00:11:33.07 a reflection okay well I missed it it froze again I missed oh my god

00:11:40.10 what do you say sorry I was gonna do a bit but it actually happened

00:11:47.16 stop I just don't care enough about the answer to ask you again okay did you

00:11:53.02 think that I got scared by a guy's hand with a turkey sandwich

00:11:57.16 in it yes coming through a hole instead of the reflection of that behind me

00:12:02.17 exactly I thought that you got scared by somebody shoving a turkey sandwich

00:12:07.14 through a hole unexpectedly and you just saw a movement and that's right

00:12:11.18 I mean I may have not described it very well I was worried about that at the

00:12:16.08 time because it's it without the visual you had the picture though

00:12:21.12 you did you described it exceptionally clearly it was fine

00:12:25.12 my dumb brain just I decided that was a wall

00:12:28.06 and that was facing you and that that was a food hole and that planes now have

00:12:31.22 food holes since I've last gotten unplugged I made a lot of leaves but

00:12:36.05 don't you think I would have mentioned the phrase food haul

00:12:40.10 yeah you probably wouldn't I wish you guys could have seen the room when I was

00:12:45.01 trying to describe the food hole to the place I think I opened with you know how

00:12:49.06 planes now have

00:12:51.07 my these

00:12:54.23 the thing like you did a great job the thing you didn't account for is that

00:13:00.00 Andrew doesn't understand planes I don't understand planes and I

00:13:03.09 apparently don't see because we had the same issue with the break [ __ ] thing

00:13:06.12 where I was like there's nobody in the stands on that card and then the people

00:13:10.19 like what are you talking about that's the full arena my eyes just don't work

00:13:14.20 oh oh yeah yeah I had so much fun on that last break [ __ ] the one with the

00:13:17.20 [ __ ] stick break [ __ ] that was that I feel like that show is really coming

00:13:20.21 into its own uh one of the things that we we're

00:13:24.12 I was I was saying in the last podcast in 2022 I want to I want to go into

00:13:29.06 sports in a big way I think one of the ways I want to do that is that idea that

00:13:33.01 we we uh officially announced on the break

00:13:35.16 show which is that we I want to create the infinity towel right which is uh you

00:13:41.01 know you guys have long made fun of me for having a a baseball or basketball

00:13:46.02 card that has a swatch of Marcus smart's game worn game game-used towel

00:13:49.20 uh and it says uh tools of the trade which you think is ridiculous that a

00:13:53.11 towel could be a tool uh and you know I we had the idea and it

00:13:56.08 might have actually been your idea from the beginning Andrew uh but we had an

00:13:59.20 idea to to get as many different pieces of towels from as many different nba

00:14:03.14 players as possible and create like the most talented towel of all time the goat

00:14:08.23 of towels the infinity towel with like LeBron James and Kobe Bryant and Steph

00:14:12.12 curry and you know Jason Tatum and and Nikola jokichin all the best players and

00:14:17.14 then we just sew it together and make this like patchwork uh

00:14:21.13 quilt towel of power as it were it was an idea that like arranged

00:14:26.12 I didn't know the towel cards existed I didn't know that was such a dumb thing

00:14:30.02 that could even possibly exist I wanted to do it says food hole guy yeah

00:14:35.07 originally yeah well I mean that's listen

00:14:38.05 that's my stupid idea that's my I would never because of the trade towel card

00:14:43.16 that's absurd talented towel nice nick nice nick

00:14:49.07 there are cards too of like I there's a whole set of Adam sanders

00:14:54.10 he's cutting out again this sucks this [ __ ] this blows

00:15:00.00 he needs to stop the prince did he actually stop he's still printing the law

00:15:05.05 we're bordering on not having a second episode here we have too many more of

00:15:10.17 these [ __ ] problems nick is a tremendous editor but he can

00:15:15.14 only do so much he can't invent audio that doesn't yeah

00:15:18.05 he can't create a show out of sackcloth and ashes unfortunately

00:15:22.15 oh yeah yeah maybe you could maybe you could do Andrew for pickups

00:15:26.23 well gav do you wanna do you wanna just oh no he's back is he back you guys uh

00:15:34.10 when are you going out of town kev borrow or something god damn it

00:15:41.01 yeah do you think his c drive's full well yeah because uh the pre the the law

00:15:47.05 is a very it's a thick document so I would think that saving that unless he

00:15:52.17 just printed it from a browser which is more insane

00:15:57.09 it's like all of his cpu you said just loading the law in a web browser 100

00:16:03.16 cpu devoted to the lock Google chrome am I back

00:16:11.09 oh boy in a big way you're back I think I'm back oh yeah [ __ ] is your

00:16:16.06 computer full is everyone quiet is this oh my god

00:16:27.12 can you not hear me can you imagine you hear me can you imagine I genuinely

00:16:33.01 can't hear you I'm so sorry I'll leave and I'll come back it's 2022.

00:16:37.16 You're like I'm gonna start the new year off right I wanna I wanna start fresh

00:16:41.19 I'm gonna I'm gonna pick up a new podcast maybe something that's been

00:16:45.16 recommended to me or maybe I'll just search around for my relative interest

00:16:49.02 oh face right yeah I'll give this a shot

00:16:51.14 I'll I might as well just start with the most recent episode just start 2022 off

00:16:56.17 as they are in 2022. This would be the last episode you ever listened to

00:17:01.14 this might ruin podcasts for you as a whole if you listen to this geez Andrew

00:17:07.20 no oh god this is really something are you just being quiet now on purpose

00:17:15.07 oh I'm back now I'm back mean I'm so sorry you're not back

00:17:20.00 you're cutting out you idiot you mean I'm cutting out what do you

00:17:24.15 want what I mean I'm kind of you know what he means no I don't delete the lord

00:17:34.19 last time I froze up I was just going to my tab with notes just go to my notes

00:17:39.17 tab don't do anything do nothing we okay I'm not going to touch a thing can

00:17:43.12 we just use your mouse no hands can we go to the next season

00:17:46.21 can we just change seasons at this point I feel like this season's already lost

00:17:50.02 can we move to whatever season three season four whatever we're on I think we

00:17:54.05 got a go I mean I'm so sorry yeah yeah we can

00:17:57.08 we could this could be the last episode let's swap seasons yeah season three was

00:18:02.18 horrendous but don't move in this episode it has to be next episode we

00:18:06.17 need to clean you right I can't do a mid-episode season switch because that

00:18:10.21 happened on an episode

00:18:13.07 midway through all right well now we've got to do it

00:18:16.15 because it's because it's groundbreaking

00:18:19.21 because you're doing [ __ ] that nobody's ever thought of before

00:18:26.15 and that's the moment season three year two of face ended congratulations you've

00:18:32.15 made it all the way to season four year two of face episode one season four year

00:18:38.02 two face overall episode 84 and a half I guess at this point is where we are

00:18:43.22 maybe yeah we may be tainting season four as well

00:18:49.12 um but I think it was worth doing just to be a mid-episode switch of seasons

00:18:54.15 I feel bad for season three I feel like season three had a lot of opportunity

00:18:58.19 had a lot of good momentum and then it just got bogged down with with uh

00:19:03.03 technical problems that that it's gonna make it look in the grand scheme I think

00:19:07.09 it's gonna be overlooked as a season but for what it was two and a half episodes

00:19:11.03 or whatever I think it was really strong

00:19:13.16 it was like a season of Luther or something sure you could probably submit

00:19:17.22 the entire season to an award show or something like best season because it

00:19:21.14 was strong brief yeah strong and brief yeah it was a very British great point

00:19:26.15 because they they always submit like just one or two episodes from a show

00:19:30.11 those are word things we could genuinely do the entire season season three is

00:19:34.20 fully up for nomination I will say is since we started season four uh your

00:19:39.20 your audio has been phenomenal Andrew yeah yeah that's what I said we gotta

00:19:45.23 god damn it oh but are you serious

00:19:50.06 no he must be messing with us you can't ruin season four two you killed season

00:19:58.23 three you can't kill season four in the woods it's it's in the cradle still it

00:20:04.04 hasn't even taken its first breath yet it's eyes aren't open you can't kill it

00:20:09.10 now we might we might have to go back to season three I don't know that this

00:20:15.03 isn't that can't you can't do that this is you can't go backwards I mean it's

00:20:19.06 like I just don't think that season four ever got off its feet and now look at

00:20:24.13 where we're at like this is oh my god this is like a season three post mortem

00:20:29.17 we might just have to put a bullet in season four and start over again with

00:20:33.14 season five holy [ __ ]

00:20:35.16 no no we can rescue season four I'm so sorry what are you doing he wasn't doing

00:20:41.05 anything I was just sitting at a screen and everything froze my computer sucked

00:20:47.18 I stopped printing the law like an hour ago I'm wearing two sets of headphones

00:20:54.10 I don't know well I I don't know I don't know what to do

00:20:59.12 I'm talking into two microphones right now what do you want from me I'm trying

00:21:04.15 legend like legible audio something this is Andrew oh man.

00:21:20.23 [Music]

00:21:26.10 But then there's going to be double audio and so I can

00:21:33.16 his original file is still running and recording his mic Gavin zero I don't

00:21:39.07 know what nick is going to do here we go what do you mean is this this

00:21:46.00 it's the same mic I just put the headphone out and I'm just I'm talking

00:21:49.22 into it like a phone it's the same it's the phone but I removed my Xbox mic it

00:21:53.19 sounds so much better yeah this is good no it's not good it's not good it is not

00:21:59.05 good but it sounds better okay I don't I'm still this might have to be

00:22:04.06 the final episode this might be where this all ends

00:22:08.00 well because I have plans for 2022 I want to talk about an idea.

00:22:17.07 Andrew do you want to I want to end on my ideas so Andrew do you want to cover

00:22:21.15 what you wanted to talk about no it's go ahead you talk about your

00:22:25.00 idea I'll be here I'll just be quietly listening all right support you well

00:22:29.02 here's the deal 2022 new year fresh start right we just started season four

00:22:34.04 we put season three to bed a little earlier than I anticipated by about

00:22:40.02 50 episodes uh but whatever that's it I have no interest in looking in the

00:22:44.07 rearview mirror let's move always marching forward that's what we do right

00:22:49.05 uh we're going to advance towards future victory so

00:22:52.01 season 3 was forcibly put down nick said yeah Jesus Christ it's like old yeller

00:22:55.12 we took it around the back behind the barn and put two between the eyes

00:23:00.02 [ __ ] hell uh it had rabies yeah we had to cut its head off just to make sure

00:23:06.10 uh otherwise billy's going to get a series of shots we got [Laughter]

00:23:19.09 hey thank you so much for listening to face a extremely chaotic episode I

00:23:25.14 apologize uh I would not recommend attempting to

00:23:29.07 download and print the law while recording a show

00:23:32.20 I would however recommend using expressvpn because using the internet

00:23:37.01 without expressvpn is like leaving your laptop exposed at the coffee shop table

00:23:40.21 while you run to the bathroom most of the time you're probably fine

00:23:43.18 but what if one day you come out of the bathroom and your laptop's gone

00:23:47.18 I think everyone could use a vpn because

00:23:50.10 every time you connect to an unencrypted

00:23:52.03 network cafes hotels airports any hacker on the same network can gain access to

00:23:56.13 your personal data whether that be passwords financial details really any

00:24:00.16 information that is personal to you that

00:24:02.11 you wouldn't want shared it also doesn't really take much knowledge to know how

00:24:06.06 to hack someone I mean a kid could do it if they wanted to

00:24:09.07 your data is valuable hackers can make up to a thousand dollars per person

00:24:13.11 selling personal info on the dark web there's clearly incentives to do so

00:24:17.14 there's a clear motivation and I I think it's just important to use or why I

00:24:22.03 would use expressvpn is the fact that they offer an encrypted tunnel which

00:24:25.22 creates a secure encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet

00:24:29.20 hackers can't steal your sensitive data super secure it take a hacker with a

00:24:33.16 super computer over a billion years to get past expressvpn's encryption it's

00:24:38.02 easy to use you just fire up the app and click one button to get protected works

00:24:43.09 on all devices whether it be phones laptops tablets and more so you can stay

00:24:47.09 secure on the go what I really like about expressvpn is that it's it's so

00:24:51.15 easy to use as well as it just gives a level of comfort

00:24:55.07 um I'm not doing a lot of traveling right now but just in general it's a

00:24:58.21 great thing to have even if you're not as I said the ease of use is awesome and

00:25:03.01 it's just I'm somebody who can worry about anything so just not having to think

00:25:08.21 about that or worry about my data or my personal information

00:25:13.09 is awesome secure your online data today by visiting expressvpn.com

00:27:09.12 so we've done really well for ourselves we created an unsearchable unsellable

00:27:15.18 unnameable podcast about less than nothing and we've achieved all like an

00:27:21.20 incredible amount of success in that endeavor and I'm I'm floored by it it's

00:27:26.20 a testament to how talented you all are it's a testament to how supportive the

00:27:31.11 comment leavers uh and the regulation listeners are uh but I I feel like we've

00:27:36.00 hit a plateau and I want to figure out how to break into that next echelon to

00:27:39.15 keep growing to keep innovating and getting better because we're changing

00:27:44.10 the world here right through this podcast and so I was thinking like what

00:27:47.21 can we do that what can we take on that's bigger that maybe is more

00:27:52.13 momentous that could have some sort of a an effect that that

00:27:56.02 improves the the state of things in some way and then it hit me

00:28:00.12 we and I was also looking at what's popular on other podcasts and stuff

00:28:05.12 I think face in 2022 we need to solve a murder [Music]

00:28:10.19 that's what all the true crime podcasts are doing they're all out there solving

00:28:16.21 murders why don't we find and solve a crime or a murder we could do it right

00:28:22.00 we've got the regulation listeners andrew's got a spreadsheet of

00:28:25.13 multi-talented people we're relatively smart we've got reach and influence why

00:28:30.08 don't we solve a crime a mystery and then we'll and it will that just got me

00:28:34.21 imagining what if there's another podcast out there trying to solve the

00:28:39.18 child kicker problem oh my god oh my god I'll be right back oh my god

00:28:44.19 Geoff why did you accidentally eat pastrami now we've lost Geoff I think we

00:28:49.12 I think we may have found the murder what is going on

00:28:54.03 what is the murder Geoff did the dog I think murder might be Geoff was that his

00:29:00.00 bit where he's like oh my god he's he's the victim he's forcing us to solve

00:29:04.03 his murder no I'm not I'm not gonna fall for this clue dinner party [ __ ] he's

00:29:09.07 not he is fine this is a game no you talking about me

00:29:13.15 no what happened was I was taking a drink of diet dr pepper right when Gavin

00:29:18.21 made that joke about the Vancouver child kicker and I threw up in my mouth

00:29:24.09 I I laughed so hard and I shot dr pepper into my eyeball and I had to run to the

00:29:29.02 bathroom to dry off because I I shot out like a half of dr pepper all over the

00:29:33.17 mic all over my phone my pants oh it was

00:29:36.04 and it was immediate we thought you were doing a bit where it's like guys we

00:29:40.23 should solve a murder oh no someone with a knife

00:29:44.14 no no but your wit was very sharp okay say that [Laughter]

00:29:49.07 anyway uh yeah this is something unhinged is a

00:29:52.21 great way to put it Eric uh so anyway if the audience is aware of any murders

00:29:57.23 that need solvent uh let us know we'll look into it you know no don't send us

00:30:02.21 any murders we don't need any murder information

00:30:06.18 keep that to yourself or contact the authorities we don't need to get

00:30:11.07 involved in murder army of murder finders yeah well I mean that we want a cold

00:30:15.12 case right we want to like a btk type thing we don't want to oh yeah I'm not

00:30:19.07 looking it has to be well established we want something

00:30:25.07 what if we finally solved the zodiac killer wouldn't that be cool for our

00:30:30.09 podcast what a feather didn't they just do that I feel like

00:30:34.08 that's the bad example I thought they just solved that

00:30:37.20 yeah but what if it wasn't us what if it was us that's what I'm saying

00:30:42.08 what if what if we were what if we were the [ __ ] uh

00:30:45.15 what's his name's wife rest her soul oh pat oswald pat nelswell yeah yeah only

00:30:50.06 murder only murders in the dark is that what that was called yeah it was [ __ ]

00:30:53.09 phenomenal there's something like that yeah uh

00:30:55.17 what it sounds to me like I need to start printing the law again is what

00:30:58.18 you're saying I need to get back into it get to the fine details I could be a

00:31:01.20 details guy for this laughing let me start back up I only got like I don't

00:31:05.09 know 700 more people no maybe wait let's wait until after the podcast and then

00:31:09.17 maybe you can print the law okay as long as I get to print the lot at

00:31:13.01 some point I'm okay with it I don't know what you guys want to do in 2022 but I

00:31:17.16 wouldn't I wouldn't be opposed I wouldn't be opposed to becoming sleuths

00:31:22.21 if we solved the mystery of some kind it would not be shocking to me

00:31:27.07 that that could happen that seems yeah why don't you press print on the law how

00:31:33.03 many pages did it say it was going to do I I just clicked

00:31:37.09 what cup you got to be kidding me did he go again did he just was he doing it in

00:31:43.01 real time did he click print did he click print on the law again

00:31:48.10 he was like well I did this

00:31:53.01 I'll tell you one thing if we might have to solve if this

00:31:56.19 happens a couple more times in this episode

00:32:00.05 somebody might have to solve the murder of Andrew pan

00:32:05.07 we can't even solve why his stuff doesn't work and you want to solve murders

00:32:10.19 this is something I'm looking at the time on our recording but I'm also

00:32:15.12 looking at the time the separate clock in my head of how much real content we

00:32:20.10 have oh we're four minutes into the second yeah

00:32:24.04 we got sev we got seven okay minutes right like

00:32:28.03 we got like 18 decent minutes I'd say at least 19. I gotta argue a strong 19.

00:32:33.20 Did you repeat your question Gavin I missed it at frozen in the middle middle

00:32:38.16 you're you're asking page count how many pages was the law I was

00:32:42.10 wondering I was wondering if the light is different if you could climb the law

00:32:46.04 like if you couldn't reach a light bulb but you but the law was thick enough to

00:32:49.09 climb to change it like could you make the the law useful in other ways that's

00:32:54.10 a great question how tall I would be with that how tall is the law

00:32:57.19 is is like the only thing I need to be in the nba the law if I could just stand

00:33:03.07 on the law would I then become like a genuinely decent center in the nba in

00:33:07.19 addition if you burned the law in a fireplace in 8k could you burn it for

00:33:12.08 eight hours and if so would people watch it

00:33:18.15 this podcast feels like we had it in one piece at the beginning it smashed and

00:33:23.14 we're all four of us on our hands and knees like turning over pieces of it

00:33:27.12 like reading off it like you know what it's like yeah it's like that Japanese

00:33:31.18 art where they like smash a bowl and then they put it back together and then

00:33:35.10 they outline the breaks in gold right and then it's supposed to show like new

00:33:39.02 beauty and in the preservation and the reconstruction of it we're doing that

00:33:44.02 but we're all out of gold so we're using feces

00:33:46.13 can we can we upload this podcast but change the logo for this one episode to

00:33:51.01 a smashed window with [Laughter]

00:33:57.09 well that was that that was my uh my clip for for 2022. I want to I want to

00:34:02.08 solve a crime uh Andrew what do you want to do in 2022 other than um buy a

00:34:07.18 [ __ ] computer that works uh well let me go to my notes I gotta load my notes

00:34:12.16 on no do it don't do it oh no well I'm already frozen I'm on my phone it's fine

00:34:17.01 okay uh let's see and we may have covered uh the home alone

00:34:21.09 I wanted to talk about home alone with you Geoff you recommended home alone oh

00:34:26.15 my god a new one I recommended Holmes a new home alone the led over a rob

00:34:31.09 home alone yes recommended it watched it last night it was

00:34:35.11 it was not terrible but I don't why would you recommend that move I thought

00:34:40.10 it was cute and okay no it was it started they there are so many I like

00:34:44.03 the the mcu the involvements of the mcu I like I thought that was a great

00:34:48.08 agreement I told you it makes total sense and it

00:34:51.15 feels like you get it and you go that's enough I I appreciate it the fact that

00:34:55.23 the fact that you find out spoiler so if you if you don't want to get spoilers

00:34:58.00 from an okay movie uh don't listen to this part but the fact that Kevin

00:35:01.11 McAllister is still [ __ ] with his brother after all these years is really

00:35:06.06 [ __ ] funny I enjoyed that and I like the idea that Kevin McAllister

00:35:09.11 created like a home alarm empire and he's like the home alarm guy that he has

00:35:13.07 a system I just didn't know who to root for in the movie you root for rob

00:35:17.01 Delaney and Ellie kemper not the kid the kids obnoxious you don't care about the

00:35:20.13 kid you root for the criminals in this one that's that's what makes this one

00:35:24.10 different I feel like is that the criminals are the main characters and

00:35:28.06 and the sympathetic characters but it still has all of the horrendous traps

00:35:32.10 and stuff in it that is supposed to be the fun of the final

00:35:35.11 last act yeah I don't care who gets hurt I just want to see people get hurt

00:35:39.00 I just felt confused I didn't know I didn't know who to cheer for I felt like

00:35:42.12 it took away from the traps I didn't want them to get hurt or as opposed to

00:35:45.23 the first film they're such great dumb villains that it's just every time

00:35:49.12 something horrible happens you can cheer for it

00:35:52.01 felt very totally weird did Kevin mcallister's parents ever

00:35:55.12 find out what happened to him while he was home alone that's a great question I

00:35:59.12 think if they had the second movie couldn't have happened right why would

00:36:03.15 he keep that from them I don't know but why would they at least don't tell them

00:36:07.18 why would they ever let him leave their sight again I mean he almost died a

00:36:11.13 bunch they were gonna kill him he also cleaned up all the mess except for the

00:36:16.17 gold tooth yeah that's true how did that

00:36:19.14 not get swept up yeah eric's leaving now at least he at least he's letting us

00:36:22.15 know I'm just stepping away for a second I'll be right back I will cut this out

00:36:25.22 leave it in can we have it

00:36:28.10 what we have a podcast where every single

00:36:32.08 cast member doesn't leave at one point well can you not be so funny you make me

00:36:37.18 throw up on myself I just I just have to I finished a cup

00:36:41.14 of coffee I have to piss and I'm just you guys are talking about homeowner six

00:36:45.01 or whatever I'll be right back you know you don't say anything ninety percent of

00:36:48.03 the time why would you even put the talent I tell nick I let nick know and I

00:36:52.02 figured this was easier I always let nick know when I'm stepping away and

00:36:55.20 next time I'll just let men know and I won't let you know

00:36:59.20 nick do you need to okay do you need to take a break any point nick are you good

00:37:05.22 well he's typing [Laughter]

00:37:09.01 nick says you picked a hell of a time to do that and I'm good I will say one

00:37:13.03 thing that kind of annoys me about this home alone thing I get that it's not a

00:37:16.15 great movie I just said I enjoyed it I thought it was cute I really I enjoyed

00:37:20.07 getting a piece of that world again I think the thing that's funny is all the

00:37:24.00 [ __ ] that you know that you and people are talking about me on twitter when

00:37:27.02 it's very clear to me they haven't seen the movie they think they're talking

00:37:30.04 about home alone three and they're not like I had some kid go the other day

00:37:34.02 some kid was like was like yeah I've known that movie sucked since I was 12

00:37:38.21 and I'm like the movie came out like November 15th

00:37:42.23 you cannot rule out that they've turned 13 Geoff you can't roll it out

00:37:47.02 but it's become very clear to me that people don't know what movie we're

00:37:51.07 talking about I get I looked it up it's got a 13 on rotten tomatoes like it's

00:37:55.07 not well reviewed but I don't think it's nearly as bad as the as the heat that

00:37:59.02 it's getting is it home alone five is it technically the fifth or the sixth one

00:38:02.12 uh it's either five or six they definitely made four I think it's five

00:38:06.12 or six okay I remember three being one of those three being like not as good

00:38:10.10 but watchable at least yeah three wasn't great yeah

00:38:13.07 it was an interesting experience to watch because I started it and then I

00:38:16.21 tweeted are you [ __ ] with me Geoff or something along the lines to Geoff

00:38:20.16 because it starts horribly it's a really shitty beginning to a movie and then by

00:38:25.08 about like the halfway point I almost wanted to tweet an apology because it's

00:38:29.18 not good but it's it's not the worst and I could see myself being nine and

00:38:33.23 really enjoying this movie yeah and then the last act happened and the last act

00:38:37.19 was terrible I hated the last act as well not the worst thing ever but it

00:38:41.07 just I would never it's a weird recommendation I thought it was a good

00:38:44.14 holiday movie I'm glad I recommended it that's fair that's fair I mean

00:38:48.21 what about it's weird there's some snl cameos in it that are very strange that

00:38:53.02 I don't understand why like they're not big enough names to have a reaction to

00:38:58.06 and they're only in it once well do you wanna do you wanna know why I think it

00:39:02.02 was written by Mikey day from snl oh I think it was I think it was co-written

00:39:08.00 by him if I'm if I'm correct so it's from snl alum

00:39:11.00 in some way so I think I think that's the connection there oh there's [ __ ]

00:39:15.21 dr pepper on my keyboard [Laughter]

00:39:19.18 I wish dr pepper on my keyboard was my biggest computer problem at the moment

00:39:25.09 I'd take that I feel like it's your doing though I don't I don't

00:39:29.23 even interestingly so Mikey day and streeter from college humor wrote that

00:39:34.21 movie oh I used to love those uh prank wars prank wars videos yeah yeah those

00:39:40.06 are fun and some of them were brutal like the skydiving one Jesus Christ god

00:39:45.16 or the [ __ I or the proposal at yankee stadium

00:39:50.17 they got real they escalated fast that was a great

00:39:54.19 series if you're not familiar with like or I guess early to mid 2000's college

00:39:58.23 humor videos they had a series called prank wars where this dude streeter who

00:40:02.18 was like a trying to be a stand-up comedian and then this dude amir uh who

00:40:06.18 you might remember from Jake and emir uh they would do these escalating prank

00:40:12.02 wars and there was one where amir uh put a paid to get a

00:40:15.22 a wedding proposal on yankee stadium from streeter to his girlfriend and

00:40:19.17 didn't tell them and then he gave streeter and his girlfriend free tickets

00:40:23.03 to the game and then secretly recorded it when it popped up like in the seventh

00:40:26.12 inning and his girlfriend thought he was

00:40:28.06 really proposing and all the cameras and everybody looked to them and he had to

00:40:32.12 be like no I'm not and it was [ __ ] brutal it was a great series

00:40:36.10 yeah I don't know I feel like it's tough to like when the punchline of the prank

00:40:40.23 is you think you're gonna die that's tough prank what do you weigh.

00:40:48.13 I should rewatch this oh that was so good or the one where he made him think

00:40:53.00 he uh he hit the half court basketball shot with his face.

00:40:57.07 I briefly played Mario kart with amir for a few nights and uh all of our we

00:41:02.07 weren't talking we didn't have like voice chat so all of our dm's to each

00:41:05.12 other are just like in the moment messages about that particular Mario

00:41:11.01 kart race so our dm's make absolutely no sense that's [ __ ] funny uh

00:41:16.12 Andrew are you still able to talk um Eric you done pissing do you want to be

00:41:23.05 Andrew while he's gone every time he drops yeah I've been back for a while

00:41:27.09 this episode has made me feel weird I feel weird I feel different I feel like a

00:41:32.06 different person I just don't know what you do like I don't wh this all started

00:41:36.12 because he wanted to print the law not even in this episode now we're in

00:41:40.04 the situation that we're in I know what you mean I don't I wouldn't say I feel

00:41:44.19 weird but I don't feel good nick said that this is the writer's

00:41:48.23 strike episode equivalent and I couldn't agree more with he said that

00:41:52.12 season three is typically a good season and then now we're into season four and

00:41:58.21 it's really falling apart um it's genuinely hard to get worse at

00:42:02.13 something that you do all the time but I think we've proven that possible time

00:42:07.14 and time again Andrew oh my god.

00:42:13.18 I'm

00:42:22.21 we might have to create some official face laws about how we conduct ourselves

00:42:28.12 during and what the things we're allowed to do in the periphery while we're

00:42:33.14 recording oh my god do you know those two you know the law now no it's upstairs.

00:42:42.17 I

00:42:52.12 You know in all the movies when a robot is being destroyed and right at the last

00:42:57.11 minute that's talking like voice boxes all broken you sound like a

00:43:02.12 dying robot from any movie right now still your house 2001.

00:43:06.12 Your ass for aliens well here's the thing you sound better

00:43:10.07 now but I know as soon as we say that you're going to drop out again so yeah

00:43:14.19 I'm not touching anything I haven't touched anything for a while I'm scared

00:43:18.15 nick said between 2021 and 2022.

00:43:22.15 He's stuck between seasons it's a problem he's still got one foot in

00:43:27.22 season three yeah we've left that behind Andrew Andrew

00:43:32.12 well at least we're not stepping over each other

00:43:37.14 what do you want to do for the next eight minutes or so before we can stop

00:43:42.23 this Eric what have you got for this week uh let me think what do we uh we

00:43:47.16 got the we have some really interesting merchandise coming out I have to sell

00:43:51.18 stuff just well you know what if you go in general like what's

00:43:55.01 what are you looking forward to in 2022

00:43:56.19 Eric um you know I'm looking forward to some of

00:44:00.08 our podcasts going on tour not this one but other podcasts going on tour

00:44:05.12 looking forward to traveling is oh no this one's allowed but trying to

00:44:10.16 coordinate to to get it on tour has been um

00:44:13.14 increasingly difficult uh it's gonna happen it's gotta happen is it I mean

00:44:18.16 I'd love for it to happen it's gonna have to happen it's gonna

00:44:22.02 have to happen in Vancouver we're gonna have to go to Andrew and it needs to

00:44:25.13 happen I don't give a [ __ ] about doing

00:44:26.06 the podcast on tour I don't give a [ __ ]

00:44:28.16 about doing it in front of an audience or any of that stuff what I care about

00:44:32.07 is crabbing I care about bathtub races I care about all the stuff we're gonna

00:44:36.19 film when we go to Canada this the podcast tour is just an excuse to get us

00:44:41.14 together so that we can film [ __ ] in Canada well I was told that the original

00:44:46.00 idea of going to Canada for this podcast tour is not doable so the earliest we

00:44:51.20 could do it maybe 2023 but [Laughter]

00:44:54.15 so we can but we can try to go to Canada otherwise yeah we've got so much to do

00:44:59.18 yeah we gotta have dinner that's right we gotta find andrew's house

00:45:06.13 well if we go to Vancouver or whatever to go

00:45:10.17 record with Andrew we have to bring a lot of equipment because there's no

00:45:16.10 way we can use [ __ ] anything that Andrew has well we won't be tripping

00:45:21.23 over the law just to get in oh no I'm so sorry we have to film a fireplace

00:45:27.07 video in Vancouver yeah if this wasn't free I would be

00:45:31.09 giving everyone a refund this podcast you know what audience I'm going to give

00:45:36.17 you a free fund you didn't pay anything but I but but

00:45:40.08 I'm giving you it's a free it's it's a it's an emotional thing I'm giving you a

00:45:44.08 little it's a yeah it's now your time that's gone you we can't give you that

00:45:49.11 can't do anything about that yeah but just know that we wasted potentially

00:45:53.11 more of it making this than you did listening to it

00:45:56.04 oh it's we're getting the cakes out for the tuxedo right now it's all that

00:46:01.05 matters oh my god it's never gonna be good I will say if that goes

00:46:05.19 flawlessly if we record and the tuxedo works and we have no technical issues

00:46:10.18 I'm jumping out a window I'll flip I'll [ __ ] flip do we have the tech worked

00:46:16.14 out for the tuxedo I assume we'd all just be watching at

00:46:20.23 the same time on our own feet let's just sync up

00:46:23.08 I think that I can host it I'll just get you guys a program that's very easy so

00:46:27.08 you can view my screen in real time uh yeah that'd be good because I'm doing it

00:46:30.22 over discord because I don't trust whatever Andrew just said Andrew's gonna

00:46:34.08 sit on his remote Geoff's gonna spit dr pepper on his it's gonna be a mess if

00:46:38.19 we're having to sync is gonna be a whole thing

00:46:40.20 are we afraid of like tuxedo audio bleed coming in to our commentary or anything

00:46:44.18 I don't care just wear your headphones and you'll be fine

00:46:48.17 okay should we the the episode that's just come out this week was I think the

00:46:52.15 first episode of season three should we just tweet and tell everyone that season

00:46:57.18 three is over already I can't say what can't say why

00:47:00.19 but season three isn't season three is ended season three got two and the two

00:47:05.06 behind the eye

00:47:07.12 yeah we should this one's coming together though I think we've got a

00:47:12.17 significant amount I think this is a fine I mean why am I

00:47:15.19 [ __ ] talking I don't know what happened for 80 of the show I'm the least

00:47:21.01 I can't evaluate this you're talking play catch up [ __ ] we need your

00:47:26.06 word count Gavin and I are out of juice according to audacity I've been

00:47:30.23 recording for 18 minutes so what uh what what what you've been oh poor [Music]

00:47:37.01 what do you niche also we should probably talk about

00:47:40.13 something that Andrew told me in confidence about last week's recording

00:47:45.12 oh yeah what's that is that true even gonna object to this

00:47:49.05 is even here I don't think he's here anymore yeah so you can just do it he'll

00:47:53.10 never hear this [Laughter]

00:47:56.06 now he just says he's typing.

00:48:02.03 [Music]

00:48:03.11 Geoff when you pitched wait I understood I'm going to go set the law

00:48:08.21 on god fire fix [ __ ]

00:48:11.22 oh my god he can't even type straight screens hot that I quit

00:48:20.15 fire thick [ __ ] is jack doing is jack doing a read of this of what this

00:48:26.04 episode is because it's insane because in the middle of everyone going no

00:48:31.22 Andrew stop it's just nick linking to home alone the holiday highest

00:48:37.05 and there's some stuff about his car at the top

00:48:42.10 oh my god Andrew admitted to me last week that while he was recording he for

00:48:48.00 some reason had to stop recording for like a minute and then just resumed

00:48:53.18 his file so without even mentioning it to nick so

00:48:58.04 that he knew that the edit would go out of sync nick said that explains a lot

00:49:05.07 so I guess his file just skipped forward and

00:49:09.01 and I was like well you got to tell him he's like I can't bring myself to tell

00:49:12.16 him nick how did that go for you what did you have to figure out I should have

00:49:18.04 just told you shouldn't I I had the information you're part of the problem

00:49:23.14 nick probably missed a [ __ ] milestone with this kid because he had to spend

00:49:27.15 extra time editing yeah nick what happened I looked up and

00:49:31.05 there was this huge desync and I was like oh and usually it's by like a

00:49:34.15 quarter of a second but instead it was like by 10 he started laughing at

00:49:40.00 nothing like it was just silence and then him laughing into the void

00:49:44.03 it was super bizarre so finally I figured out what he did or I figured I

00:49:47.13 was like oh his computer is just stupid so I backed it up but now that I know

00:49:53.05 that's his computer yeah his computer messes look at today we uh

00:49:57.23 I think we this might be the hardest we've faced ourselves in a while oh big

00:50:03.22 time which 18 minutes do you think Andrew has

00:50:07.05 he's got a lot he's got 18 minutes of him going well I think

00:50:13.01 we should take andrew's raw recording from today and press that up to vinyl

00:50:18.14 and just give that to people I just came back and heard 30 seconds

00:50:24.16 great Andrew [ __ ] awesome

00:50:31.20 25 minutes ago why wouldn't he do it oh my god how is this better than the two

00:50:37.07 minutes it would take to reboot and restart oh man this is incredible is the

00:50:42.19 law preventing a reboot maybe yeah can the episode be I'm gonna set the law

00:50:49.11 on gaia it's against it's against the law to stop the law during printing oh

00:50:57.01 oh I got one piece of uh just a minor housekeeping uh because I know you guys

00:51:01.16 are so [ __ ] concerned about my physical health uh I got the results of

00:51:06.10 my x-rays back on my my hips sorry I can't I'm not just looking for andrew's

00:51:11.11 screams like this what didn't like it one bit no no bib you [ __ ]

00:51:17.20 Bella ha did watch we got to ignore Andrew for a sec I listen to x the x-ray

00:51:22.21 results what what happened well they were brief there was I got a

00:51:27.08 very quick email that just said nothing on x-rays however

00:51:31.07 you do have arthritis in your spine and I don't know what that means that's all

00:51:36.21 he said he just said I'm like I guess I gotta [ __ ] I was like okay so I guess

00:51:42.02 I need to make a follow-up or something but you're in your voice trying to feed

00:51:46.01 the dogs well I already have arthritis in my shoulder we that's well documented

00:51:51.20 from when from the bash and the freeze yeah and my my spine so I'll take that

00:51:55.21 as good news awesome so well just real quick just top I'm just thinking like

00:52:00.21 top of mind stuff or whatever uh throwing 80 still or what's up well

00:52:05.22 that's a great question that would be a big part of 2022 right I'm definitely

00:52:09.12 off on my timeline I don't think I'm gonna get there in my

00:52:13.01 90-day window or whatever because I haven't been able to I mean you know get

00:52:18.00 on a bicycle or lift and like it's been rough

00:52:20.01 but now that I know that structurally my hips are fine and I'm just dealing with

00:52:23.22 arthritis in my spine uh I mean it doesn't change the fact that I have a

00:52:27.09 lot of pain still in that leg so I guess I gotta figure that out but uh at least

00:52:32.12 I know there's nothing like structurally wrong so I take it all

00:52:36.06 as good as a good sign that I can get back to my training now I'm gonna I'm

00:52:40.00 gonna attempt to ride a bike for the first time in

00:52:42.17 over a month this weekend and we'll see how that goes and then if that goes well

00:52:45.23 then I'm gonna start throwing heat this is the bike that pedals for you yeah

00:52:48.23 it's the sitting part that's hard okay not the pedaling part got it gotta gotta

00:52:52.15 get I got it got it got it okay that makes sense anyway

00:52:53.20 and then I'm sure Andrew has a lot he wants to say now so take it away yeah

00:52:57.18 Andrew go ahead just whatever so he typed

00:53:11.07 we'll have to screens hot that right we'll have to screens hot that and

00:53:15.20 yeah one day this discord chat will make

00:53:18.14 a tremendous book oh so jack has to read through all this too so that's pretty

00:53:22.18 exciting I wonder if he's gonna be able to even do a preview or it's just gonna

00:53:26.21 say the episode exploded like what's he gonna say about this

00:53:30.05 it's a great question he also said this is the perfect episode to introduce a

00:53:34.14 new person to the do you think so I mean I guess it is the letter of the I mean

00:53:39.06 it's it's within the spirit of the name the what does it say about us that we

00:53:44.16 actually put this one out what does it say we have zero quality

00:53:48.18 control oh yeah that we have other that we have other things to do that we ran

00:53:54.20 out of hours to make anything else yeah

00:53:57.13 andrew's not even here anymore he's just why

00:54:01.11 doesn't he reboot have we have anyone he's one of the main hosts he does the

00:54:06.14 intro sometimes sometimes he does that he did add this

00:54:10.09 yeah which I appreciated because I couldn't get to it

00:54:14.15 well I [ __ ] dude I guess we should stop

00:54:16.20 don't you have to go play video games or something gav you have to play

00:54:19.22 participation machine or something I have to go to an arcade and do a bit of

00:54:22.22 fun yeah sorry this episode was bad Gavin has to go to the arcade I'm the

00:54:27.03 only one who didn't leave in the middle of it

00:54:29.19 listen I only sing it out too yes second I left it one second that's fair that's

00:54:35.05 fair oh yeah and it was only because of your talent yeah if anything it's your

00:54:39.14 fault I'll tell you anybody I'm happy with

00:54:41.20 that play uh nick stayed the whole time that's true well now you did it nick you

00:54:45.12 moved the carpet with your wife you already said that well that was the last

00:54:48.13 you were like oh first recording okay I was here the whole time for the first

00:54:54.02 recording look there's something to be said though

00:54:57.02 about setting an incredibly low bar at the beginning of something this year

00:55:00.23 it's hard to trip over yeah we'll do well to be worse than this

00:55:05.16 that's that's a good point and if that's not a selling point for

00:55:11.05 tuning in for the next 365 days of face content I don't know what is it can't

00:55:16.19 get worse that means next week when you tune in and listen to it it's going to

00:55:20.11 be at least this good but probably like slightly better yeah we might be at

00:55:25.22 the beginning of a pretty pretty severe dip

00:55:27.21 it only goes up from here the face story that's right nick oh my god

00:55:33.03 uh well uh I guess I'm done uh nick Gavin Eric you guys got anything else

00:55:40.12 you can check out store.roosterteeth.com for all the cool face merch we have out

00:55:45.03 now go check it out I'm sure there's some things that we didn't even know

00:55:49.14 went up uh boys of zimmer et cetera go check it out yeah

00:55:52.03 and I'm pretty sure that the uh um [ __ ]

00:55:55.01 sticks are on the way don't forget about those also we've got the the metal uh

00:55:58.23 bread clips coming uh three socks we're gonna solve a murder those aren't and I

00:56:02.21 believe I believe the uh community Christmas

00:56:05.21 album came out and uh that I I was just starting to listen to it last night it

00:56:09.17 was very good so give that a shot too why do you think folgers trademarked the

00:56:15.01 piece of foil that goes over the top of their coffee excuse me

00:56:19.05 like when you open it and it says aroma seal

00:56:22.10 tm like what's special about their piece of foil

00:56:26.04 I guess seals in the aroma yeah I just feel like there's seals and everything

00:56:31.08 they don't all have fancy names you drink a lot of folgers uh I'll drink

00:56:35.07 folgers in an emergency yeah if I've got like old beans or something

00:56:40.08 gammy old beans I mean it's I I'm not criticizing it it is the the

00:56:44.03 best part of waking up as they go yes that is what they say

00:56:50.17 as someone who hand grinds your beans Eric do you ever do you have a stoop as

00:56:55.12 low as vultures uh like I guess in a like if I have to if I'm on set and

00:56:59.05 there's coffee and that's it yeah but it gives me a headache like it tastes like

00:57:02.23 the taste gives me a headache I think it's just but I think that's linked to

00:57:06.06 like that smell from like when I was a kid or

00:57:09.06 like school or something I don't think that it's like the coffee necessarily

00:57:13.01 that gives me a headache I think it's psychosomatic

00:57:16.09 Andrew is apologizing yeah he Andrew's back and apologizing Andrew are you on

00:57:21.07 mike do you want to apologize on mike

00:57:23.12 no he's he's maybe gone again yeah he's he uh I think he might be I think he can

00:57:29.07 talk now he's just too embarrassed to speak

00:57:33.18 I wouldn't be surprised if Andrew was able to talk for the last five minutes

00:57:39.21 Andrews Andrew do you want to do the outro buddy it's all yours
