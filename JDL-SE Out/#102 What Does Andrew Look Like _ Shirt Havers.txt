00:00:00.00 Foreign.

00:00:09.11 [Music]

00:00:17.00 I got it my beard that beard is all beef

00:00:20.08 you have a beefy beer yeah hold on let's get into the podcast hello and welcome

00:00:26.18 to episode 102 of the F**kFuckFacePodcast my name is Geoff Ramsey with me as always

00:00:31.17 Andrew Panton Gavin Free this is uh just for posterity's sake this is year two

00:00:36.17 season four uh Andrew you have a beard yeah I have a beard currently I don't

00:00:41.18 know what you look like my mentor it is just never never right you need to

00:00:45.19 describe yourself every month just so I've got a good Mentor yeah okay well

00:00:49.21 it's the same as before I have short hair that's that's still the same and I

00:00:54.13 have a beard currently how long is the beers like a jack beard no it's like a

00:00:58.16 small it's not it's it's a it's a very mediocre beard full coverage or is it

00:01:03.16 like trimmed it is a little coverage but

00:01:05.19 it's just not like super full it's not a great beard you don't sound like you

00:01:11.05 have a beard yeah I do I can tell you I can smell it right now I got Bobble in

00:01:15.12 it from the pop and it is not good

00:01:19.02 smells worse than it tastes yeah I think I'd agree in my experience having had

00:01:25.09 salad cream prior to that it being frozen made it so much worse I had

00:01:29.20 something about the smell and the texture not even froze just super cold

00:01:33.21 it wasn't it wasn't Frozen at all what did it do to the texture did it make it

00:01:37.13 more congealed was it more solid or was it just very cold it was more congealed

00:01:43.13 it felt more solid and just it has such a strong taste and it's just so

00:01:47.17 overpowering that was gross I hate that we did frozen pops and my favorite

00:01:52.14 beverage of cold my cold my cold beverage of choice Coke was the one that

00:01:57.17 wasn't picked the only my favorite cold thing was the one that was left off oh

00:02:03.00 you know I I will say through the course

00:02:05.10 of spending that week in the UK and then going to that Community Meet up I talked

00:02:10.03 to a lot of people uh bovral pretty universally not loved but every single

00:02:14.16 person to a fault loves salad cream and uh Branson pickle hell couldn't say

00:02:18.15 enough good things about them yeah they were very very popular over there

00:02:21.14 apparently I'm so glad I didn't go with Ransom pickle that was a consideration

00:02:24.21 of one of the Ice Pop flavors frozen breast and pickle would be very

00:02:28.05 interesting I wasn't sure if I'd be able to freeze it with its the texture of it

00:02:32.05 and like the contents I wasn't sure how that would equal out but sour cream

00:02:37.08 certainly didn't work well I think we have some new recipes for the face Cooks

00:02:41.10 the food Jesus Christ cookbook when we finally make it so since we do you wanna

00:02:45.14 you wanna ask your questions now since it's fresh in your mind another episode

00:02:49.16 another two guesses for you both yeah Gavin you go first uh was this person in

00:02:55.11 fluke face no oh [ __ ]

00:02:56.15 oh God he needs to come up with like a list possible people you have a question

00:03:00.19 Geoff that you'd like to ask then maybe it will help Gavin with his guess I

00:03:04.15 can't it's I'm I'm struggling I'm struggling to remember what we've

00:03:07.11 already asked I want to ask but I'm scared I've already asked okay if

00:03:10.13 they're related to if they're like one of the online lawyers if they're related

00:03:15.03 to that whole segment I don't I also don't remember if you've asked that but

00:03:18.16 I'll just say no they're not okay okay another clue out with the rate we're

00:03:22.21 currently going why didn't you yeah why you're putting me on the spot I don't

00:03:26.04 want to just give it away with a clue I don't trust myself to not give a very I

00:03:29.20 will say okay so a previous question you had asked was has anybody gotten this

00:03:34.01 correct yet there have been lots of comments about it and I said not fully

00:03:37.23 that is no longer the case one person has made a completely correct guess as

00:03:42.19 far as what this is I'm gonna have to sift through comments so season two

00:03:48.07 can I tell you my my the worst guess that anyone's made so far is it the one

00:03:53.23 I made last no it's actually worse this is I'd be impressed if you uh if you had

00:03:58.16 a worse guess than this one and this was

00:04:00.22 done in a message that was uh very sweet so it wasn't like a bit they just they

00:04:05.00 didn't have an awareness of this and I didn't know how to reply to it they

00:04:08.02 guessed that the voice was Norm MacDonald

00:04:11.14 but a dead B exceptionally distinctive voice and Cadence that's a double layer

00:04:19.00 it's the worst guess by far if I was able to get somebody who was dead to do

00:04:24.03 the previously on could you imagine bringing somebody back to just do a

00:04:28.02 previously odd voice that was why they came back I mean the previously on voice

00:04:31.18 the guy sounds like he's got a surfboard in his hands and that's not what Norm

00:04:37.08 MacDonald sounds like no no it does not but that's been my favorite of the the

00:04:42.11 worst guesses I've gotten by far so that being said do you have a guest Geoff is

00:04:46.00 it uh is it Billy Ripken it's not I wish

00:04:48.17 that would be great one now yeah I don't

00:04:50.13 I know it's I know it's not it's way too

00:04:52.15 young I just don't know what else to ask yeah that's fair process of elimination

00:04:55.21 totally we should probably write down your questions and guesses throughout

00:04:59.21 this I also appreciate that you went with one that I think you already asked

00:05:02.22 when Nick wrote out a much better guess that you just didn't use well you were

00:05:07.13 saying oh I wasn't looking at the uh at the Discord let me see oh yeah yeah I

00:05:12.08 think it sounds too young to be your Barber I considered that as well

00:05:15.04 interesting because your Barber's like 105. No that was my old one I got a new

00:05:19.17 guy I knew much younger I swapped swapped out gab do you want to ask a

00:05:23.06 question you still or you can still make

00:05:25.05 a guess uh was it a delivery driver that you've had in the past no it's not I

00:05:29.13 thought you already guessed too that's how much these popsicles have taken out

00:05:32.23 of me now I asked a question I don't think okay he didn't make it I'm still

00:05:36.22 I'm still Gathering from that so Geoff went to the UK what did you do Gavin

00:05:41.10 since we last recorded I was just here you're just here we played Halo we did

00:05:45.23 play Halo it was very weird Gavin brought up that it's because you were in

00:05:50.07 the UK Geoff that it's the first time I think we've not recorded an episode

00:05:54.01 because you were like it wasn't him so him just being available for the week

00:05:57.15 it's a very strange thing like it's an odd Rhythm to get out of it's nice when

00:06:01.12 we're weekly usually when Geoff's gone and I'm still here I get pulled into off

00:06:07.03 topic or something but that didn't happen I'm not sure knew that face was

00:06:11.07 off but yeah I ended up just having a free period well just played Halo with

00:06:15.16 you as I did my taxes we had an exciting well you were away Geoff we had so much

00:06:19.21 fun Gavin did nothing and I filed taxes I was waiting for you to get home from

00:06:25.12 your taxes yeah it sounds like you guys really took advantages

00:06:28.20 I was very excited to see you texted me Geoff you were now watching The Challenge

00:06:33.07 one of my favorite reality shows of all time yeah with Survivor yeah I uh I

00:06:38.17 started watching it I don't remember well I think we're just in the hotel

00:06:41.19 room and board and it was on and I was like [ __ ] it let's give this a shot and

00:06:45.22 I've I honestly forgot about it until this moment so thank you you for

00:06:49.10 reminding me that I need to finish watching that show because I was quite

00:06:54.06 enjoying it I found that the uh the challenges to the challenge you know

00:06:59.18 I'll say half of the half of the enjoyment of reality TV for me is

00:07:04.11 watching people just like just mishandle

00:07:07.13 their lives the other half of reality TV that I enjoy is watching games that

00:07:13.16 people play like the inventiveness the creation of the games it's why I love uh

00:07:18.01 that's why I enjoy Big Brothers sometimes obviously why I like Survivor

00:07:22.22 and the challenge has some really interesting like legitimately physically

00:07:27.22 demanding uh maybe more so even than Survivor challenges and I'm kind of

00:07:32.05 fascinated by that like they are no joke the challenges yeah they they get

00:07:37.16 ridiculous and it's for me it's a great mix of the social politics of Survivor

00:07:43.06 but from much Dumber trashier people yeah and then all the same people like

00:07:48.20 there's a guy on there named CT who I think he did his first challenge when he

00:07:52.06 was 27 he's 41 now I want to say and he's been on essentially every season so

00:07:57.09 it's like you have all this buildup of [ __ ] from like decades that's also

00:08:01.23 interesting like it is it is such a like

00:08:04.11 uh like you see people like the season I watched there's somebody I recognize

00:08:08.06 from Survivor on so that was cool yes uh and there was somebody from Big Brother

00:08:11.13 who I didn't know but it's cool to see the inner the interplay of of different

00:08:16.13 reality shows but mostly there seems to be a core group of people who uh just

00:08:21.18 live in this challenge yes uh universe and it's their entire lives to the point

00:08:27.01 where they're like they'll I interesting.

00:08:29.10 Dynamics the first people that get voted out are people that are on the show for

00:08:33.12 the first time like the worst thing you can do is be on your first season of

00:08:37.22 that show you were instantly gone they're like you gotta pay your dues you

00:08:41.19 gotta take your lumps get the [ __ ] out of here see you next year and then uh

00:08:46.06 it's like brutal they don't even care they're just like yeah it's your first

00:08:49.15 time get the [ __ ] out and for other people it's like a full-time job it's

00:08:53.12 like their entire lives yeah that's all they do and it's it's just it's an

00:08:57.05 absurd there's so many great as it's progressed it's gotten more into the

00:09:01.15 physical side and it being really challenging on the earlier Seasons it

00:09:05.15 was just like a giant party where people were [ __ ] up they had to dye all the.

00:09:09.22 Vodka because people were smuggling them in their water bottles to do the

00:09:13.06 challenges and just getting drunk like while they were competing there'd be

00:09:16.12 time where cast members would just like leave and go into the City and they'd

00:09:19.16 have to shut down production for like four days because three of the

00:09:24.06 contestants were just partying in Africa and they lost them and it's now a much

00:09:28.23 less fun show but way more serious it's just dumb there's so much great

00:09:33.09 pettiness to it I think dumb is the great way to describe it it's like if

00:09:37.21 you're not familiar with that show it's like all the the dumbest people on.

00:09:43.00 Temptation Island and love Island but who aggressively want to win a contest a

00:09:47.12 competition yes like the goal is not to find love love is like a by-product of

00:09:52.15 apparently getting drunk enough and being available in the night but uh they

00:09:56.21 legitimately want to win these physical competitions so it's all it's like it's

00:10:01.06 like the it's like the dumbest meatiest per people going head-to-head it's

00:10:05.05 [ __ ] great I'm gonna send you a post Club one of I think the greatest edited

00:10:09.20 videos of all time I've shown this to Eric before somebody added together an

00:10:13.17 argument between two CT who I mentioned and another regular named Wes watch this

00:10:18.06 Gavin it's like 60 seconds long I feel like this summarizes the energy of the

00:10:22.18 show fully it's a fantastic breakdown all right should we watch this right now

00:10:28.02 yeah let's play is this guy Hammett oh yeah this is what the show is it's just

00:10:33.10 aggressively screaming all he does is smash heads

00:10:42.11 is this as is in the show like how it was edited uh no this is somebody okay

00:10:48.22 it's unfortunately censored When You See It live but just die die die

00:10:54.08 the time steps are so funny

00:10:59.10 Brad I hope they ran that as a trailer so a great thing about CT is he was

00:11:04.19 banned for like six seasons because he kept fighting people he [ __ ] the guy

00:11:10.14 up like they couldn't it took like seven security guards to hold him back and he

00:11:16.15 just annihilated the tiniest guy on the cast but he's back now he's now a

00:11:21.12 lovable character which one was CT in that club CT was the die die die die the

00:11:26.03 other guy is a bad guy on the season I'm watching yes and he's always been a bad

00:11:30.12 guy he's been like a bad guy forever one

00:11:32.05 of my favorite I mean not to go too deep on the challenge my favorite like Petty

00:11:36.12 dumb thing is there is this issue where a woman had a note left in her bed

00:11:41.04 saying that I know you're just sleeping with him for his Vote or something like

00:11:45.08 that and it caused all this drama and then the notes started getting left out

00:11:49.01 throughout the whole season they're like

00:11:49.16 who the [ __ ] is leaving notes and like they're trying to they have they made

00:11:53.17 everybody write down one of the messages to try to like match the writing and

00:11:57.19 then somebody revealed that him and his sister wrote all the notes before they

00:12:01.11 came on like he had his sister write them so it wouldn't match anybody and

00:12:04.21 they're just generic messages that he wanted to apply throughout the season so

00:12:08.19 like it wasn't aimed at anyone specific you just had this bag of notes that he

00:12:12.05 could deploy and it caused complete chaos in the house it's fantastic it's a

00:12:16.11 great series I would highly recommend anybody watch the challenge especially

00:12:19.11 the earlier seasons of it the other night I watched Being John Malkovich

00:12:23.11 which I hadn't seen in a long time have you ever seen that I've never seen it

00:12:26.14 I've always wanted to I hear it's so good it's I mean it's weird it's pretty

00:12:31.03 good yeah I was watching it and I was like this is so weird I wonder how this

00:12:36.22 I wouldn't know what to do if I was hard of hearing right now because there's a

00:12:42.03 bit where basically one woman is in love with Cameron Diaz but only when Cameron

00:12:47.00 Diaz is inside John Malkovich so they like me up but only when she's in.

00:12:51.01 Malkovich and it's at one point they start having sex and like different

00:12:54.04 people are talking like you could hear Cameron DS and you can hear John.

00:12:57.23 Malkovich and you could hear the other woman I was like what the hell is going

00:13:02.05 what is what are the subtitles doing right now and I just turned on the

00:13:06.08 subtitles and I just laughed my ass off just says unzipping and then just both

00:13:11.08 characters and exploding I was like yeah I mean

00:13:15.16 sure it would be honestly the most confusing movie to watch without one of

00:13:20.14 your senses I I recommend watching it though so it's weird as [ __ ] I'll add it

00:13:26.10 to my list I need to watch uh The Long Kiss Goodnight that's right on my Q now

00:13:30.10 that's a great movie we were that's a terrible movie that's a great movie you

00:13:35.08 talk about it's a uh what's her face and uh Samuel.

00:13:39.01 Jackson's in it too right yes so I haven't seen it Renny Harlan is my

00:13:44.13 favorite schlock director of all time I don't think he's ever made a genuinely

00:13:48.17 good movie but he makes really fun bad movies like consistently is it Gina

00:13:53.05 Davis who's the yeah I think that's right yeah like a sleeper agent or

00:13:57.06 something and she doesn't realize she's like chopping up the vegetables and then

00:13:59.15 she's like a [ __ ] badass she doesn't really oh that was a I saw that movie in

00:14:03.05 the theater I haven't seen it since so maybe it doesn't hold up after 30 years

00:14:06.06 but I remember loving it I'm excited to see it Eric is live why are we should I

00:14:11.02 they collect this oh let's watch Eric watching Eric

00:14:15.14 I wanted to show you guys I didn't open it in the chat but I got the shirt

00:14:26.12 yeah okay I just wanted oh yeah all right so just for people at home just so

00:14:31.16 you know because we can't put it in the chat this is because that's a great.

00:14:37.15 Point that's the sneaky great Okay cool so I'll I'll let them know to send it by

00:14:41.21 the time you listen to this episode I don't know if you can still get this

00:14:53.10 when are we is that going up tomorrow at noon when is yeah wait uh people are

00:14:58.16 only going to be able to buy it without before the podcast came yeah I think

00:15:01.23 they're let me read you the description for the shirt which I've lifted from the

00:15:07.18 annual pass shirt uh theme parks are opening their gates in the scent of

00:15:12.17 fresh chili dogs hangs in the air it's anal passage season and that means it's

00:15:24.18 That's fantastic that's fantastic that's gonna be a great little Easter egg for

00:15:30.00 people to find it oh man yes I was worried in between episodes that Jack

00:15:33.03 would be genuinely mad at that one well then you said it's gonna it's gonna come

00:15:37.23 out and release before he could react to it like it sounds like that shirt will

00:15:42.22 be available tomorrow doesn't matter I guess I released a

00:15:46.16 [ __ ] a face shirt of him with his dumb bald head that was up for like four

00:15:51.03 days and then told him he could get revenge on me whenever he wanted to and

00:15:54.09 he's too lazy to do it so I wouldn't worry too much even if he is mad he's

00:15:58.08 just gonna stew with his own juices he's not gonna do anything about it

00:16:01.22 um so so this will go on sale at the time of this recording it'll go until

00:16:05.15 tomorrow at the time of you listening to this episode it will have already been

00:16:09.22 on sale and you can no longer get it I assume uh we assume yeah say if if we're

00:16:14.02 on the subject of shirts can I bring something up real quick that uh of

00:16:19.06 course me and Andrew were in the uh yeah we were in the merch meeting uh earlier

00:16:23.15 today and um we got the numbers for the regulation listener and comment lever

00:16:28.22 shirts and they didn't they did well however one did way better than the

00:16:34.12 other though regulation listener did like five times the numbers that content

00:16:39.02 or that that comment lever did and I need people to really take a long hard

00:16:44.12 look at themselves if they're a regulation listener or a comment leaver

00:16:48.05 because I have a feeling there were a lot of people who bought regulation

00:16:51.17 listener shirts who are truly common Believers I have absolute proof of this

00:16:56.10 where it on the the face Twitter account just as a joke to myself like it was we

00:17:01.07 tweeted are you a regulation listener are you a comment lever and a lot of

00:17:04.23 people like the first five were all like

00:17:06.19 I'm right I'm a regulation listener it's like I don't think you understand how

00:17:10.03 this works you need to buy the other shirt if you go on the subreddit it's

00:17:13.22 like these people who like jump through these hoops on well I'm leaving a

00:17:17.19 comment here but it's not on the show so really I'm a regulation listener and

00:17:22.16 it's like no you're leaving a comment on yeah

00:17:25.06 your comment lever you've left a comment the joy in my head of this entire

00:17:29.12 premise is you know like if you're in an audience or whatever it'd be like

00:17:32.23 everybody was commonly for say hey like there'd be like a big response everybody

00:17:37.15 who's a regulation listener just nothing that's what's funny to me about like

00:17:41.23 there should be zero response it should seem like an empty room I mean it makes

00:17:46.12 total sense though that the regulation list of sells better because there are

00:17:50.01 more it does people who don't comment but I don't the numbers indicate to me

00:17:53.20 that there is a discrepancy in people that are just not as Eric said coming to

00:17:58.06 terms with the fact that you're in fact a common leader it's either people align

00:18:01.20 to themselves or they're just confused because I think regulation listener just

00:18:07.18 as itself plays in a really funny way it's not indicative of anything it's

00:18:11.16 just you regulation listen like if somebody saw someone wear that without

00:18:15.21 any context like it means nothing it means they listen to things I guess but

00:18:21.07 there's an absolute comment lever denial happening

00:18:24.16 and it's okay to be a comment leaver I'm a comment lever yeah I'm way more

00:18:28.11 comment lever than yeah comment on other

00:18:30.09 stuff a lot of other people's stuff uh I

00:18:32.03 comment I've commented on stuff relating to the show yeah yeah but that's you're

00:18:35.21 on this show that doesn't count no I'm definitely comment lever I've commented

00:18:39.07 on the show you can't comment leave your own show you absolutely can yeah that's

00:18:42.19 a ridiculous thing that's not weird though it's weird to leave a comment on

00:18:46.05 someone else's show that's the whole point of a comment lever isn't it I

00:18:49.10 would maybe argue it's more weird to comment publicly on a show that I'm on

00:18:53.06 when I don't need when I have channels internally to do it I think it's maybe

00:18:57.01 weirder that I'm doing it but Eric's whole point was like who leaves a

00:19:00.08 comment but me on the show it makes sense for you to leave the comment nah I

00:19:03.17 don't think it does if I'm just commenting about it sometimes you know I

00:19:06.19 might just say hey good app get out I think it's good we need to include

00:19:10.16 people who've never even heard of the show we need one that's just a shirt

00:19:15.15 buyer you want you want a shirt that just says shirt

00:19:21.01 buyer like I don't think that would understand if they don't understand

00:19:25.16 comment lever and regulation list though that it like need to reply but they

00:19:29.13 would never buy the shirt they need to know to get to the shirt what are you

00:19:33.09 talking about so then they would be so then you have a shirt that says

00:19:37.05 non-shirt buyer no you can't have a shirt this is non-shirt buyer because

00:19:41.01 that's impossible you're saying Gavin like a Lost Child they somehow end up in

00:19:45.18 the store and then they don't know what to buy so they need a shirt that fit

00:19:49.17 they need to understand the premise like the person you're describing doesn't

00:19:53.04 exist they're an impossibility you find yourself on this on the receipt store

00:19:57.06 and you see two options and you think I don't know what either of those mean but

00:20:02.09 I'll buy a shirt I'm on this site to buy a shirt didn't

00:20:05.19 mean to be here but I'm locked in and committed to buying a shirt I don't know

00:20:09.20 what any of these mean I guess I'm a Surefire

00:20:13.02 what percentage there'd be like I would buy that shirt too but not for the

00:20:16.18 reasons that you're listing that's an insane logical I think we need an option

00:20:21.06 for people who don't listen to the show hey this is why would we sell a shirt

00:20:26.18 for people who don't listen what if all right what if because what how about I I

00:20:33.03 agree with you Gavin and I'm okay I'm saying we could tweak it what if

00:20:36.17 instead of a shirt buyer because you might want to give it to somebody as a

00:20:39.19 gift and if you receive a shirt buyer as a gift you may not be a sure buyer what

00:20:43.18 if we just had to show that said shirt wearer oh this is everyone this is so

00:20:49.12 seven billion people on Earth all wear shirts I assume I feel like it should

00:20:53.00 just we couldn't have we couldn't have a because aware if you're wearing a shirt

00:20:57.14 that's a shirt wear that's redundant you're clearly a shirt wearer it doesn't

00:21:00.19 wearing a shirt that says shirt is redundant no it's not well what do you

00:21:05.17 mean it's a shirt it's a shirt it's a T-shirt and Alyssa's

00:21:09.15 shirt on it's a clarification of what it is yeah but you need you need the verb

00:21:15.04 yeah and it needs you can't just have [ __ ] there needs to be an action on the

00:21:20.03 shirt yeah a beaver regulations

00:21:27.09 like I like [ __ ] have it because you don't even need to put it on it

00:21:35.04 this is so insane let us know we're absolutely not gonna make a shirt have

00:21:41.14 her shirt unless there is an overwhelming amount of uh of uh demand

00:21:47.11 if you want a shirt having a shirt lettuce you can't let us know you can't

00:21:52.06 listen because then you'd be a comment lever yeah it's impossible.

00:21:59.20 Sinner's word for it because because then they become comment levers so then

00:22:05.10 they have to become shirt havers this is

00:22:07.18 really oh man no that's a good point Not

00:22:09.17 only would they not leave a comment they won't even hear this because it's not

00:22:13.06 for them well the problem is super complicated well I guess not because

00:22:16.20 they will leave a comment on Instagram and just say it wasn't a comment and

00:22:20.05 just continue as as they exist how is it not a comment it's definitely common I

00:22:24.06 think well to define a comment I think it's anything I think it's anything you

00:22:28.12 went somewhere online and typed something yeah yeah I think if you want

00:22:32.06 yeah I think it's a good classification I think so Nick is saying uh is a

00:22:36.10 message a comment like a DM if you message me about a show I can't stress

00:22:41.08 enough how you're a comment lever because I don't want to read it I don't

00:22:44.13 want to see it but you sure are commenting about what we're doing so

00:22:48.04 absolutely you're a comment lever that's almost an extra comment lever because

00:22:51.15 you're getting really pointed and focused with the comment yeah two that's

00:22:55.07 too focused for a comment yeah I don't like it so that's a that's a no to the

00:22:59.10 uh shirt buyer I think let's just try to get through the anal passage and then

00:23:03.00 we'll see what happens otherwise we're averaging at one shirt per show by the

00:23:06.16 time this comes out we'll definitely be through the anal passage I don't think

00:23:11.10 that's good well that's great because anal passage

00:23:14.18 will be sold out and some people out there might want to buy a shirt sold out

00:23:19.11 is a fun way to say forcefully pulled down I appreciate your flip before wait

00:23:24.04 hang on you're saying that people might want the anal passage shirt but it's not

00:23:28.17 theirs so they'll have to buy a shirt have her shirt

00:23:34.11 gift for somebody in your life and you're not sure what to get them maybe

00:23:39.23 they're hard to shop for I got news for you everybody wears a shirt and if you

00:23:45.07 have a shirt you're a shirt Haver go ahead and buy them a shirt Haver shirt

00:23:50.04 it'll be super appropriate is Heather or what what do you care

00:23:54.07 seventy percent of the [ __ ] that comes out of your mouth isn't a word well.

00:23:58.16 Haver I don't know is really a word but Haver is and it's Scottish to talk

00:24:03.17 foolishly so I think we're really havering Perfect all right well uh we'll

00:24:09.01 we'll shelf that for now I just realized is the bother pop two

00:24:13.14 uniform inventions in one is that the beef bracelet mixed with uh too spicy

00:24:19.16 too spicy well do me a favor eat some some Spicy Thai food or Indian food or

00:24:24.19 something and then shove that Bob pop up your [ __ ] and let me know if it

00:24:29.07 relieves the pain if it doesn't then it probably doesn't work in that capacity

00:24:35.02 okay but if it does then yeah oh sure owner says Nick shirt outer I'm I'm a

00:24:39.12 definite shirt owner do you have a go back to movies for me you're a bid Haver

00:24:43.12 as well uh currently yeah that's that's officially correct I cannot wait for us

00:24:48.14 to be done and I could have a shower to get the smell of beef just um just I

00:24:52.11 need to I need this so bad I'm struggling through this I wonder when

00:24:57.00 that cow was alive uh that's a that's a fascinating

00:25:00.13 question do you think that's a pre-pandemic Bob I don't you think I

00:25:04.16 don't think you're talking about a cow I think you're talking about a couple

00:25:08.02 thousand cows probably comprised into that one pop just like a vat of cow Chum

00:25:14.15 yeah yeah I just ate a field of cow yeah

00:25:17.08 you ate half an Argentinian Farm oh yeah you ate elements of lots of cows oh I

00:25:21.10 hate I've never thought how many chickens are in like a thing of nuggets

00:25:25.07 like a a McNugget box like a six piece yeah it's a ton it's a ton I don't know

00:25:30.07 if that makes me feel better or worse about that like if somebody said you

00:25:35.21 just ate ate layer I think that's upsetting but if it's so many I can't

00:25:40.12 possibly know the name personally as opposed to you just ate

00:25:44.02 Larry and everyone he's ever known yeah like it's it's too much it's like when

00:25:48.19 you certain once you hit a certain threshold of numbers it's like it

00:25:52.07 doesn't matter it's all the same I think it's I think it would be worse if you

00:25:57.07 knew the chicken's name yeah never ask a chicken's name

00:26:01.09 word to the wise yeah it's a good tip

00:30:30.03 hey how's the how's the how's the um like the kitchen tabletop going at your

00:30:36.04 house you got any any new uh conversations with your mom no no I

00:30:40.09 haven't I haven't had I had she said one thing that was that is really funny but

00:30:46.18 I don't know if it plays at all so I I talked about the friend it's been

00:30:50.16 guessed a lot this person Jake my friend Jake it's not Jake I could tell

00:30:53.23 immediately it wasn't yeah it's definitely not Jake but he's brought

00:30:56.20 it's wild to me that people even know Jake like I don't feel like I've talked

00:31:00.14 about Jake all that much uh Jake will play games and then he will get really

00:31:03.23 angry about things he'll just scream things he'll get very aggressive and uh

00:31:09.09 he he in a fit of rage I don't remember what I was doing as I did something to

00:31:15.19 him and he called my mom a [ __ ] an anger what and

00:31:19.10 he and I I told her that in conversation and so we were grocery shopping the

00:31:24.23 other day I was with her and um she was going through a tough thing but she

00:31:29.02 loves babies like she was having a bad day and I noticed that the car next to

00:31:33.11 me there was a baby in it I was like oh look at the baby and the baby was

00:31:36.20 feeding and it was like drinking out of a bottle and my mom said I'm surprised

00:31:42.03 she's not breastfeeding when you were when you were a kid they always used to

00:31:45.18 say breast is best and I said uh I said that's what Jake says all the time just

00:31:50.14 for no reason and then she immediately replied the only breast Jake is getting

00:31:56.07 is chicken she doesn't like Jake now because of

00:32:00.05 the because and then she like cut a promo and she's like and you can tell

00:32:05.18 him that because I know he called me a c

00:32:08.17 word and I'm not a fan of that so [ __ ]

00:32:11.13 Jake essentially oh this is wild I did not expect her to slam Jake and she

00:32:16.21 slammed him yes that's probably roasted him she absolutely roasted Jake so

00:32:21.12 that's the most recent funny conversation I guess I've had with my

00:32:24.23 mom I assume she actually said the phrase sea wood and not the c word uh no

00:32:29.10 she said c word she didn't say the actual word she said that's the c word

00:32:33.20 yeah yeah do you think your mom has ever said that word out loud no I

00:32:38.07 I've said it there to her if I said it in gen well no I guess never mind I was

00:32:42.00 gonna say she'd think it was a fictitious word she's very sheltered

00:32:46.00 like when it comes to the language and uh butt plugs as established but outside

00:32:51.10 of that there's not too many updates with her you have a favorite Bad

00:32:55.12 director Geoff the way that I love Ronnie Harlan favorite Bad director like they

00:33:00.16 don't make good movies but you're a fan of their work is there any Harlan is my

00:33:04.23 guy he made Die Hard 2 uh the long kiss goodnight one of my favorite movies ever

00:33:10.19 just due to how bad it is mind Hunters fantastic 12 rounds with John Cena one

00:33:16.21 of the great WWE movies Cliffhanger Cliffhanger like all he does is schlock

00:33:22.13 I guess it depends on what you consider bad like uh one of my favorite directors

00:33:26.15 from my entire life and I I guess could fit into that category uh but I don't

00:33:30.09 think he's a bad director at all I think he's brilliant and I think what he's

00:33:33.09 doing is brilliant satire but I would say John Waters you know but I think a

00:33:36.12 lot of people would have trouble watching John Waters films but I'm a

00:33:39.22 huge huge huge John Waters fan he's a great director yeah but I mean I ca you

00:33:44.15 know I you show Pink Flamingos to to 10

00:33:46.18 people and 10 out of 10 are going to say

00:33:48.18 it's a bad movie it's a tough yeah I was so I've seen all of the Alvin and the.

00:33:54.06 Chipmunk movies and in the last one they

00:33:57.01 made John Waters has a cameo in it and I don't know who that was for it was one

00:34:00.09 of the streams I've ever seen like Alvin

00:34:02.20 is on the plane and John Waters is there

00:34:04.18 as John Waters and it's like you're John.

00:34:06.17 Waters and I'm like who the [ __ I why is he here like it's great I love him

00:34:11.07 that's awesome because he's getting paid in a kid's like in a kids movie that

00:34:15.06 came out in like 2016 like what is why is John Waters it's sort of like the

00:34:20.15 tuxedo James Brown like I'd love to know why that Cameo like what was the choice

00:34:25.17 that's one of my questions for Kevin Donovan still haven't heard back we're

00:34:29.05 still waiting maybe one day yeah I'm sure he's busy I uh oh go ahead Geoff I

00:34:33.14 was gonna ask Gavin if he had a favorite Bad director I couldn't really think

00:34:36.20 about could I I was saying uh like Brett

00:34:39.01 ratness sucks but I've enjoyed rush hour and stuff although nah like X-Men three

00:34:44.21 was a piece of dog [ __ ] it wasn't even it was no it wasn't it's not good not

00:34:48.21 good so last episode we had Dodge the Bob that was that was a big game because

00:34:53.04 this all started because Geoff he called me out he said I didn't have the content

00:34:56.18 I wasn't I didn't bring anything so I wanted to make sure I had games for the

00:35:01.19 next time we recorded we to dodge the Bob game one I got game two for you this

00:35:07.02 is an exciting thing that I came up with I gotta say that one minor throw away

00:35:12.01 joke I made just to get under your skin at the last minute right before I shut

00:35:15.23 down the podcast and you couldn't uh retaliate has really no I just wanted

00:35:20.20 you know what you made me reflect so I want to make sure I had games for this

00:35:24.09 one as stated uh I'm gonna need some assistance immediately Gavin what was

00:35:28.13 the name do you remember when you'd walk in the snow and you'd see if there were.

00:35:33.10 Footprints if somebody died guess who's dead guess who's dead this is guess

00:35:38.08 who's dead round two guess who might be dead I think guess who might be dead

00:35:42.14 round two the movie version so I was I was uh I don't know I don't remember

00:35:47.19 where I was but I saw online an image for I guess Anaconda just turned 25

00:35:52.19 years old like within the last two weeks great it was the 25th anniversary of

00:35:58.05 that release and it is a fantastic movie and so I clicked it Eric Stoltz eats a

00:36:03.17 bug and then he can't and then he just disappears in the movie he does but he

00:36:09.09 lives yeah so this was the image they used for the article of anaconda has

00:36:14.12 turned 25 years old I'll post it right now we're an audio show I will describe

00:36:20.04 it it is JLo reaching out not really minimal effort I would say at this point

00:36:26.05 an ice cube is surrounded by an anaconda screaming in pain yeah yeah if you were

00:36:30.07 to look at that photo you would think definitively that there's no way that

00:36:35.17 ice cube would get out of that situation yet he did he survived he survives in

00:36:40.10 that movie so I figured I would take some photos I blank the name of the game

00:36:45.18 Kevin what's the look guess who might be dead too I have taken

00:36:50.19 some moments from a movie I will post the photo describe the photo I'll say

00:36:54.19 the character name say the actor name and you can tell me if you think that

00:36:59.00 they died or not okay in that scene and well not necessarily in that scene it's

00:37:02.20 a it could be maybe later they just have

00:37:04.19 to survived the movie or not survive the move you're not but these are all

00:37:08.14 moments in which you look at it you go oh that doesn't look too good maybe they

00:37:12.12 lived what if a character comes back to life does that count as they died well

00:37:16.14 well maybe uh I don't know that will encounter that I guess when we count it

00:37:21.17 this next one is deep blue sea is the film the character's name is Jim.

00:37:25.08 Whitlock played by stellen Skarsgard he's got his hand out there big shark.

00:37:29.16 Big Shark's about the looks like he's gonna bite his hand does he die does he

00:37:33.21 live does he die I'm gonna say yes yes he dies he dies yeah I think just

00:37:38.14 because almost every single person dies I think I think was ello Cool J in that

00:37:43.20 one didn't he hide in a wasn't he he did

00:37:47.03 yep he's a chef he is a parrot he was he was in that film so you everybody's

00:37:51.14 saying that he lived or he died sorry yeah you think he's dead that is correct

00:37:54.22 everybody gets a point for deep blue sea do you do you uh post the next

00:37:58.18 screens hot of him actually being killed no I don't because it's it's uh it's

00:38:02.23 extremely it's extremely graphic all of the stuff that is related to his death

00:38:07.23 uh kind of a trend you'll find uh the next

00:38:11.07 movie we're pulling a classic classic film big franchise mission impossible

00:38:16.08 one oh we have Emilio we have Jack Harmon played by Emilio Estevez in a

00:38:21.09 film uh he's he's in an elevator the elevator gets hacked it's going up he's

00:38:26.11 stuck on top of it the thing pops out does Jack Harmon live killed by a guy in.

00:38:31.22 Anaconda that is that is a poll he dies instantly right there he does he does he

00:38:37.22 dies like three frames from now he does it's the three three so everybody that's

00:38:43.08 at this point for everybody yeah every free frame death okay now we're gonna go

00:38:50.02 to the next film on uh is he is he dead I like this game volume two you're a big

00:38:55.06 fan of this game yeah okay the next film is Jesus Christ Superstar

00:39:00.04 this Fella's got himself in a real predicament stuck out there

00:39:06.22 question was so bad character name is Jesus Christ

00:39:12.23 and the character the actor named Ted Neely

00:39:16.23 uh Gavin go you go ahead and go Andrew was this the part of the show that you

00:39:22.02 said we might have to cut yeah yeah it was I mean he he dies for a while yeah I

00:39:29.21 don't I don't necessarily know how to answer this one.

00:39:34.14 I think it can work both ways I'm gonna say yes yeah I think that's okay I think

00:39:40.06 that's correct I think you all get points and and that is the game that is

00:39:45.23 the end of round one of is he dead too part two

00:39:49.18 oh my God you mean guess who might be dead guess who might be dead volume two

00:39:55.02 that's what it was I can't wait for us to play that okay

00:39:59.10 man I wanted to make sure I had games because Geoff brought up that I didn't

00:40:04.11 have a thing so I want to make sure I had a thing I was guessing instead

00:40:08.03 volume two I was thinking of characters who have died and came back to life like

00:40:13.21 I was thinking in my head of like Rachel.

00:40:15.17 Weiss in the second mummy movie and then you pull up

00:40:21.17 to find that one as I just generally just kind of excited to hear what you

00:40:27.03 guys thought I think it's a great game well you really you really knocked it

00:40:33.19 out of the park on that one I hope I hope the religious audience doesn't

00:40:38.10 crucify you for it oh hey oh man I was just I wanted to make

00:40:45.09 sure I had a game I just wanted to contribute make sure oh that took away

00:40:50.09 Eric is live again are you streaming again Eric what do we got going on now

00:40:53.22 oh Eric just purchased a shirt are you [ __ ] serious already so uh they asked

00:40:59.15 who wanted him and I said all five of us yes uh so we should you should be

00:41:04.11 getting confirmation emails shortly uh so we will be getting the face anal.

00:41:09.06 Passage it's the greatest thing I just looked in

00:41:12.12 the merch stack when you said wanna remake this shirt but make it say anal

00:41:17.05 passage and Tony just said is that an official wish

00:41:23.06 official wish uh wish granted we got it oh I got my confirmation emails too

00:41:33.18 now we should all have that shirt very soon

00:41:37.10 what an insane way to come back to this show to have a watch piece to go up in

00:41:44.15 half an hour and like yeah and by the time people hear this I don't think they

00:41:50.04 can get it no it's gonna be a weird thing where we could open this is

00:41:55.09 genuinely a previously odd episode yeah everything that they've listened to is

00:41:59.12 an event that happened prior to that they cannot experience anymore you know

00:42:05.02 when I was in London I had a day where it was a quite a sunny gorgeous day and

00:42:10.03 I was walking around Hyde Park and uh just kind of uh taking in the The.

00:42:14.19 Greenery and I I got quite reflective thinking about the fact that we had just

00:42:20.07 done a hundred episodes of face and I was really nervous about episode 100

00:42:24.09 turned out my fears were unwarranted I was just like any time I'm like I'm

00:42:28.08 working on a bit and my attention is a little divided I never know I don't have

00:42:33.04 a good handle on whether it was a good or not and so I like I think I

00:42:36.07 immediately it was one of those podcasts where I immediately hit up Andrew and

00:42:39.19 Gavin and was like tell me it was good you know because I don't know and then

00:42:43.10 so I was like wondering if people were gonna dig it or not and uh and then I

00:42:48.00 was just thinking about like everything that we've done in 100 episodes and how

00:42:53.23 it almost felt like a complete book ended story and then I was thinking like what

00:42:58.11 is 100 on one on gonna be like and I really had no idea I felt like for a

00:43:03.09 while there I kind of have a handle on things and then we're kind of entering

00:43:06.15 into Uncharted Territory it was like a process to get us to a hundred and then

00:43:10.18 you like sit back and you're like well I don't know where the [ __ ] we're going

00:43:14.01 with this thing now couldn't have guessed any of this yeah uh anal passage

00:43:19.15 and is Jesus died damn uh it it just keeps on it's as much as it's a surprise

00:43:24.20 to the audience it is as much so to me as well I didn't think I would puke one

00:43:30.08 episode afterwards like as soon as we finished a hundred my immediate thought

00:43:34.08 wasn't I'm gonna vomit next episode that would have been high on my face bingo

00:43:38.07 card actually it was you vomiting really

00:43:40.10 yeah that's pretty that's like the fifth time an episode is ended that way and

00:43:43.18 it's still great every time it's the best way to end an episode is with your

00:43:48.00 audible discomfort did you have fun in Hyde Park yeah dude that place is

00:43:52.16 awesome I like London a lot did you have as much fun as this I didn't remember

00:43:57.21 I'll be honest I don't remember doing that you don't remember the pedal boat

00:44:02.22 in a my [ __ ]

00:44:04.05 I guess I tell it how that must have been a million years ago Eric brings up

00:44:09.22 a great point of you are wearing two pairs of sunglasses Geoff

00:44:14.21 there was probably a reason for that oh that's so cute 20 uh July 2010. Look at

00:44:20.02 us so much younger ah they weren't running the boats while I was there but

00:44:25.04 I walked right by that spot actually where does the time go uh one of us aged

00:44:30.02 well we're almost at two years yeah so I think people figured out the 2037 would

00:44:36.06 be episode a thousand uh like Jesus late

00:44:40.13 summer 2037 well 2037. What's already 39.

00:44:43.09 Oh my God I was I was reading the comments on episode 100 on the on the

00:44:46.16 roostee site and somebody mentioned was like uh I don't know if I'll be around

00:44:51.20 for episode 1000 because I'm almost 70

00:44:53.18 now but uh and I was like I messaged him and I'm like you better [ __ ] be

00:44:57.19 around for episode 1000 like I'll I'll put some money into keeping you alive

00:45:01.11 but the idea that we have somebody who's listening to the show on purpose who's

00:45:05.16 almost 70 just warms my [ __ ] heart and it just means that we appeal to all

00:45:10.06 ages of degenerate I love it you think that's real I assume so I don't know why

00:45:15.03 would somebody lie about their age going that way I don't know you have doubt

00:45:18.14 Gavin yeah.

00:45:25.00 I wonder who is the oldest listener well

00:45:28.05 let's get him a shot and they can buy it and then we'll know who it is we should

00:45:32.12 get his shirts as old as listener but only one person can buy it yeah and they

00:45:36.19 have to if there's if an older listener comes along they have to mail it to that

00:45:40.17 person

00:45:43.12 oh man oh God you know another comment I saw that was pretty interesting I know

00:45:49.08 we talked about it last episode but you told what has got to be a

00:45:54.18 I don't know top five moment in in uh of all time on this show which was your uh

00:46:00.13 bloody peer story in in Melbourne Australia the blood wind the blood wind

00:46:05.01 yeah and somebody said uh that guy was probably saw you alone on the pier it

00:46:10.08 was probably coming to rob you and you got extremely lucky uh and they they

00:46:14.06 pieced out of there because uh their their plan was foiled and I thought I

00:46:18.14 kind of hope that's true I gotta hope you guys but I'm about to get mugged at

00:46:23.12 nine in the morning yeah here in Melbourne yeah yeah I mean

00:46:27.12 it's possible and then let's gust of wind saved me from like 10 feet away

00:46:32.17 divine intervention yeah yeah yeah I saw that comment it's pretty funny is there

00:46:38.02 any other you don't have to say it is there any other stories like that that

00:46:42.07 you've been on the fence about telling or is that it

00:46:45.13 um I don't know it's hard to tell which ones I've told on the other podcasts I

00:46:49.06 mean that's that's weird yeah I have to like try and remember what I've told I

00:46:52.23 just meant in general like that was a story that you had never told like that

00:46:56.23 was just never been said before and yeah I'm probably not sitting on anything as

00:47:01.15 heavy as that one yeah that's what I was curious about I'm trying to think if I

00:47:05.12 because you I remember when we started the show I had like 30 you talking about

00:47:10.08 Geoff like we're trying to get to a hundred I think when we started I had an

00:47:13.23 outline of 30 things that I felt confident I could talk about that could

00:47:17.15 be like a baby be an episode like 30

00:47:19.21 episodes so the premise of us hitting 100 was definitely for me like how [ __ ]

00:47:25.01 are we gonna let you just have to not tell a story every two episodes yeah or

00:47:30.06 just like okay I've got 3030 feel really good about the next 30.

00:47:33.19 Come after the after that's why things like the pencil

00:47:36.17 trial at the time were like oh my God this is like an episode and this isn't

00:47:40.11 part of the 30. Yeah it's like a free one yeah like especially for me when I

00:47:45.01 was first starting of like trying to get

00:47:47.20 comfort ability and doing this and having

00:47:50.20 any confidence at all and like telling a

00:47:53.12 story or just just talking in General on

00:47:55.21 a show like this it was very much like I have this list of 30. I feel confident

00:47:59.17 about this but this is ideally going to last longer than 30 episodes how are we

00:48:03.01 gonna make this work so those opportunities would come up I remember

00:48:07.11 one of the First episodes like we were we established being terrible at intros

00:48:13.16 and outros very early on in the show I want to say like episode six I opened it

00:48:18.19 was a very early episode it ran there episode six I opened the show with the

00:48:23.01 outro like I I was like well we're always bad at this so we might as well

00:48:26.20 just do it at the beginning so we used to have a good outro we could use

00:48:30.19 absolutely terrifying I think that's the first time in the show where I was like

00:48:34.08 I'm gonna do a thing without talking to you guys about it that I don't know it's

00:48:37.10 just like a funny idea in my head did we love it yeah it played well but it was

00:48:41.13 like I was so nervous and doing that like it was so scary in the premise of

00:48:45.06 like holding the ball or like doing a thing that I hadn't already told a bunch

00:48:49.06 of people and knew would work comedically we've really played with the

00:48:52.17 medium when it comes to intros and outros like you did the outro at the

00:48:56.07 beginning we did the one where you did the intro at the end of the previous

00:49:01.02 episode or something we threw the ball yeah like we've really innovated in the

00:49:06.03 intro at outro space that was one of them where Geoff and I or Geoff's doing

00:49:09.22 the intro and you're trying to stop him saying that there's already an intro for

00:49:13.13 this one because you've done you've done like the legal trial on your own before

00:49:17.04 you arrived so it's just you arguing with Geoff for like five minutes yeah I

00:49:21.22 we've done some great things I've I've swayed back and forth on the importance

00:49:25.14 of intros and outros I feel like we're better at them though I think so I feel

00:49:29.17 like it's sort of just a standard intro standard outro Eric you don't think

00:49:33.08 we're better no I don't think I don't think there's been any Improvement

00:49:37.23 whatsoever that was hard hard indignation yeah you

00:49:41.23 could go back and listen to the beginning of this podcast and probably

00:49:47.12 feel about the same as what they are now I I don't I played with the medium what

00:49:53.17 are you talking about a little bit non-linear of intros and outros

00:50:00.23 I feel like we've we've done some things that uh like you're trying to start the

00:50:06.06 podcast in media rests like what are you talking about like what played with the

00:50:10.21 we've done great things and innovated out of control this is outrageous I

00:50:15.13 think we've got some of the most advanced interests

00:50:22.05 we've not got bug standard intros right mainly thanks to Andrew I think that's

00:50:27.12 undeniable that would be the issue right what you said and what I said are

00:50:32.20 the same thing oh yeah I moved quite a bit I don't

00:50:37.00 fight the intro anymore I no longer do that there's a period of time which I

00:50:42.10 thought that an intro was completely unnecessary

00:50:44.18 well okay I think with this show specifically you have zero context for

00:50:49.13 anything that ever happens like we don't

00:50:51.14 we don't set up it's not like it's green are we in season one again is it

00:50:56.14 possible to go from season four to season one then we'll be really playing

00:51:00.09 with a mediums medium of Seasons we're regressing oh yeah yeah oh my God Harry

00:51:05.15 did you fix the site by the way to display uh oh yeah [ __ ] right I'm

00:51:10.21 dude do you like the amount of work oh this is insane all you gotta do is just

00:51:15.19 file them into different seasons we should just pay a kid to fix the whole

00:51:19.09 thing in like 72 hours like also give me give me a permission to organize his

00:51:23.17 face into seasons on our site and I'll do it yeah go for it okay permission hey

00:51:29.14 permission grants for us congratulations you're in literal

00:51:34.13 site eligible to go on in and fix some stuff go nuts buddy God bless it's like

00:51:39.14 it's like giving a child a toy car wheel and telling him he's driving is what

00:51:44.16 just happened do some laps I'll be here gave me verbal permission actually

00:51:53.04 yeah God damn hey uh by the way Andrew we haven't talked about it but how I oh

00:51:59.18 time to give the dog his pill uh how are you uh enjoying this season of Survivor

00:52:06.01 I keep meaning to ask you yeah it's been great I think overall uh like a few hit

00:52:11.15 or miss episodes uh but I think generally speaking it's been a really

00:52:15.11 good season it's a huge Improvement on season 41. I feel like they took every

00:52:20.11 new mechanic and tweaked it and improved it well they filmed them both at the

00:52:24.05 same time so like well it has yeah like the cat I don't understand so they have

00:52:29.06 the shot in the dark mechanic and one of the more recent episodes Geoff Probst is

00:52:33.19 like we've changed it from a one and six to a two and twelve and I was like well

00:52:37.11 what's the point I don't understand why you've done it yeah I think the same

00:52:40.17 odds yeah I don't I don't get why they they flip that what I'm excited about

00:52:44.06 take it back to where we started they are now like CBS is doing a version of

00:52:49.01 the challenge that is like a team of Survivor contestants a team of Big.

00:52:53.03 Brother a team theme of The Challenge like it's a show where it's like

00:52:56.16 different groups like clearly defined Jonathan who's on this season of.

00:53:00.19 Survivor is 100 gonna be on the challenge and I cannot wait to see that

00:53:04.15 he'll be so great on that show it's just it's like such a perfect fit for him I

00:53:08.00 don't know why he wouldn't and I don't know why they wouldn't ask him the guy's

00:53:11.08 a beast are you watching the season gav are you finally catching up yeah and I'm

00:53:14.15 pretty sure that he said that because there's two tribes before wasn't it so

00:53:18.14 they would have had to have been a one in six chance but now everyone's merged

00:53:22.13 so it's like a two and he says odds are the same but there's there's more yeah I

00:53:26.03 guess we've never seen a scenario where like five people have attempted the shot

00:53:30.12 in the dark at the same time yeah he's gotta be the most physically dominant

00:53:34.23 uh contestant in the history of Survivor right I mean like Ozzy was that was

00:53:39.08 really good he does entire tribe challenges on his own he was like

00:53:42.21 throwing people yeah he just does everything himself and wins it's like

00:53:46.04 everyone else is irrelevant he did that one challenge in the water where they

00:53:49.11 just had to shut the challenge down he was like he did it by himself and then

00:53:52.20 no everybody else gets around yeah and then there was that one just recently

00:53:56.09 where the other team had like four balls in the hoop and his team had none so he

00:54:00.13 just climbed out of the water and threw five balls in and it was over that

00:54:03.23 episode where he and Mike are like having that I don't know I feel like

00:54:06.22 maybe we even talked about this already but other than that conversation they're

00:54:10.01 bonding over how hard it is to have muscles yes yeah that's fine I'm so glad

00:54:14.12 you brought that up one of I think the funniest things in Survivor ever has

00:54:18.16 been this season that Mike keeps putting

00:54:20.18 himself in the same category as Jonathan I love it and he always does it he's

00:54:24.19 like yeah they always Target the big guys like Jonathan and I just like you

00:54:29.05 are not you're in a different League I really liked the guy who went home but

00:54:34.23 he was like kept dropping [ __ ] and losing [ __ ] and he like dropped bikes I

00:54:39.06 was like you never gave it to me I gave it back to you it was on the floor in

00:54:43.05 the open

00:54:45.12 challenge thing like as far as dominant people on the Shoguns there's this guy

00:54:51.02 named James who was in a bunch of Seasons who had the fantastic job as.

00:54:55.14 Gravedigger and he was just jacked and they had this challenge where you're in

00:54:59.13 the water and the idea was you had two poles and you'd have two people in the

00:55:03.23 water hold the polls and the person would step on one and then move to the

00:55:08.09 other and the person with the PO like they just keep moving so you'd go like

00:55:11.20 one step at a time when one person held you up James was so strong that he could

00:55:16.13 just carry the person the whole way so like somebody would hop on the pole and

00:55:20.05 then he'd lift it and he'd just walk across to the other side and they'd hop

00:55:24.00 off as opposed to the other team having to do it properly so they like never did

00:55:27.23 that challenge again or they tweaked it I think they changed it in some way

00:55:31.07 because he just he he broke it they didn't expect anybody being so strong

00:55:35.07 and they just finished it immediately it's a great season yeah it's fun to

00:55:39.04 watch we're a reality TV show podcast oh is that the new phase we are a reality

00:55:42.21 TV show I guess we kind of always spoke with it but yeah well we're above I

00:55:46.15 guess we're I think we're done with Buffalo yeah unless Andrew wants to try

00:55:52.00 a hot bovril I I will try it next time all right we uh I feel like we extracted

00:55:58.21 more joy out of bovral than uh probably the collective uh population of Earth

00:56:03.01 using it as actual sustenance you might be right bottle should pay us yeah

00:56:06.09 Andrew have you been in contact with buffer I have not been in contact with

00:56:09.19 bovral should I be in contact with Bravo well maybe get something going I don't

00:56:13.23 know if uh what I've done with the bobber product Oh my God I just had a

00:56:18.09 great idea okay I just had a great idea great idea think about this shirt that

00:56:22.23 says buffer Drinker no no no we're not I'm just not some shitty merchandise I

00:56:27.18 can't sell people here's an idea what did we used to be we used to be an

00:56:31.08 apple podcast right for a time and we we flirt with apples occasionally we're

00:56:36.17 obviously we're medium uh Cosmic Chris fans uh what do people like to do in the

00:56:42.09 fall with apples Said a they like to Bob for apples what if you have bothering

00:56:46.16 for apples you get like a big drum you fill it with you you fill it with Bobble

00:56:51.04 and you have to Bob for apples no put your arms behind your head and dunk your

00:56:55.12 head into to bother and pull out an apple bobbing for apples

00:56:59.23 that's an experienced RTX it doesn't matter that there's you know covered or

00:57:04.16 whatever everyone can be evolving for apples in the same juice I don't want to

00:57:10.06 go into someone else's Bob we have got to at some point in our Collective

00:57:13.13 future Bob for apples bobro might have some antiseptic properties that we don't

00:57:17.15 know about that's true I I would buff for Apple I think you and I Geoff could

00:57:21.22 make a supplemental where we Bob for apples I think that's a great idea you

00:57:26.21 also speaking of supplementals uh you also need to make a Gavin's uh Italian

00:57:31.18 pizza at my in my uh my [ __ ] backyard yeah gotta clear out the spiders and

00:57:36.17 scorpions in there yeah we can do that oh man okay.

00:58:27.02 of an apple yeah I did yeah you didn't everybody's clearing his palette with a

00:58:30.17 I well I didn't think he was actually doing it and then you asked him a

00:58:34.22 question and I heard the biggest like horse style Chomp I take horse bites I

00:58:39.22 love apples what can I say I'm trying to get the beef out of my mouth Eric a

00:58:44.16 little beefy in here the beef is what lingered not all the salad cream what

00:58:50.05 was the pop that that you didn't have or yeah

00:58:54.07 that's sad but now you can you can enjoy that one you know I I don't I'm done

00:58:59.15 with popsicles for a while ruined Popsicle oh I'm sorry that's

00:59:03.20 absolutely for a little bit I got some good news and some bad news

00:59:08.17 oh December December 9th 2022 is the date we need to do it all that uh I

00:59:12.14 picked out I have my I have a Ziploc bag with my Apple in it and that says in.

00:59:17.01 Sharpie do not open until December 9th 2022. Uh however when I picked that up

00:59:22.09 out of the back of my fridge the Apple sort of collapsed in on itself and it is

00:59:28.12 a big mushy crabappley looking mess we are going to get very very sick when we

00:59:33.04 eat this what happened you try was it not ice uh clean when it went in it was

00:59:37.11 clean and sealed Geoff has the [ __ ] up fridge I do have a [ __ ] up fridge we

00:59:41.15 need to talk about the why do we trust him what's your Apple's condition Andrew

00:59:46.06 on my Apple's condition uh let me what's in the fridge downstairs oh you don't

00:59:50.00 like changing floors you want me to go run and see yeah what do you want to see

00:59:53.20 I'll try I'll go check I'll go check it is so mushy I like this because it's

00:59:57.10 sort of the halfway point yeah that doesn't bode well maybe when I get the

01:00:02.08 new fridge in 17 years I can put another one in and try it try it again

01:00:06.19 oh my God it looks heinous did you place the order for any fridge yeah I talked

01:00:11.00 about in the podcast didn't I yeah I just don't remember if you pulled the

01:00:12.12 trigger or not oh I pulled the [ __ ]

01:00:14.23 trigger that's why it's uh get it next next February on next go up yeah Justin

01:00:19.18 Timberlake maybe we should have a bit of

01:00:22.03 food that we keep for episode a thousand like do you do you have any food that

01:00:26.05 you'd want to buy now and eat in 17 and a half years yeah I'm sure I do like a

01:00:30.13 tin of beans or something probably keep what if we oh

01:00:34.21 what if we bury what if we do a what if we do like a 10-year pinhole

01:00:44.00 so I have a confession to make oh I've some good news and I have some bad news

01:00:49.21 so during during the time in which uh remember how

01:00:56.04 I said I had that stretch for like a month and a half where I really my I

01:01:01.08 injured my ankle really badly yeah you're in bed for like a month yeah so

01:01:04.21 one of those times uh during that stretch I was really hungry I didn't

01:01:09.12 feel like laughs and I didn't I didn't feel like I

01:01:13.00 was both hungry and thirsty and I thought and I thought I can't go get

01:01:18.00 food and I'm I don't want to walking to the sink is difficult like even that is

01:01:24.13 painful I took the cosmic crisp for that we were holding on for a year and I ate

01:01:29.22 it I ate it that evening under the plan of I will immediately buy another and

01:01:35.05 then just replace it and it will be the same you can't be trusted to do anything

01:01:41.08 I I have not been able to find Cosmic crisps until Sunday when I bought the

01:01:47.11 bottle so the bag of cosmic crisps I have are for the next iteration of the

01:01:52.15 one year wait so even off to Geoff's description of his Apple yours is in

01:01:57.23 worst condition uh mine is yes yes it is it is somewhere it is long gone

01:02:03.08 um so out of the three of us I'm the only one who can follow [ __ ]

01:02:07.17 directions well I follow the directions I just got thirsty and it was very late

01:02:12.19 well I knew it was fell apart Geoff so we got nothing it's still in the bag and

01:02:16.19 it's still it's just mushy it's still an apple we're still gonna eat it yeah

01:02:21.14 we'll keep yours in and I'm throwing mine in um you two [ __ ] just hard hard

01:02:27.13 salad creamed our Apple experiment no both of you I got Andrew's salad creamed

01:02:33.07 it because he deliberately ate it and what did you do never even start step

01:02:38.00 one I think you're much worse than I mine was originally on my desk at work

01:02:41.17 and then I was like oh I never put it in the fridge went to get it it's gone did

01:02:46.01 you take it did someone take it no I I never put it in I I even stopped myself

01:02:50.01 I think I told the story I stopped myself from Super lunar to your desk

01:02:52.03 because I was in the process of doing it

01:02:54.09 and then I thought oh he might need this and I don't want to ruin a cosmic crisp

01:02:57.17 so I treated it with respect much like the competition all right well I can

01:03:01.08 start at the same time as Andrew yeah well we'll have three different

01:03:04.20 iterations you got the one year apple and we'll have the whatever seven months

01:03:09.01 or whatever it is well let's be fair Geoff has to put his it again anyway no

01:03:12.18 we'll just eat what's left of what what I mean it might be apple soup by then

01:03:17.08 but we'll eat it Nick has a good point salad creaming involves an action Gavin

01:03:21.11 didn't get that phone with the Apple so I was pre-cream I don't want to talk

01:03:26.01 pre-cream right now my stomach is in a it's in a bad way why is my doorbell

01:03:31.15 ringing Andrew you didn't send me anything did you I didn't send you.

01:03:35.20 Henry's pissed Eric says that's the wrap-up Bell yeah I agree with that I

01:03:40.06 think uh I should get credit for confessing to my crimes yeah it was very

01:03:44.03 honest of you and I think uh you would have continued lying to us for the next

01:03:47.20 eight months had we not brought it up it was a very when you asked me to check

01:03:51.12 the status of my Apple there was a little bit of a panic I like that you

01:03:55.06 went anyway no I leaned back in my chair and I just kept eating the Apple I was

01:03:59.03 eating and then I almost choked on it I almost started coughing so wait that

01:04:03.02 from it was it in your bedroom fridge it was yeah it's in my bar because because

01:04:06.22 what you said you were gonna go downstairs and check I was like well how

01:04:10.12 did he get to it then that was the thing yeah well no it was that was all I left

01:04:13.20 it in there but this one I will not touch it's a promise what if you wreck

01:04:17.10 your ankle again ah that I will die I will die of thirst before I touch that.

01:04:20.20 Cosmic Chris I like that you went for the Apple for the for the liquid in it

01:04:24.16 that's why I went because they're so [ __ ] juicy I was thirsty I was more

01:04:29.09 as thirsty than hungry and I didn't I didn't have anything to do so we'll

01:04:34.06 we'll do this experiment again and just hope that for the span of 300165 days

01:04:39.07 Andrew doesn't get slightly inconvenienced or thirsty at any point now

01:04:44.23 I was I couldn't walk he describes half

01:04:48.01 no this was a different thing I was this is different dude you you almost you

01:04:53.01 almost ended up bedridden again because you got to get excited to stand up to

01:04:57.21 get in line last week no no no no no no I didn't I was fine like that was

01:05:01.12 there's no issue this was a different that was a different thing Eric wants

01:05:06.01 the podcast to be over there needs to be I agree but there needs to be some

01:05:11.12 [ __ ] ramifications for people going forward who salad cream this apple

01:05:15.20 experiment accountability Nick is right I feel like I was very accountable I

01:05:20.13 would argue I was the most accountable here you cost us five months of an

01:05:24.14 experiment because no thirsty for apples

01:05:27.00 what about what about this I'll I'll put mine in now and I'll leave it two years

01:05:30.13 it's not supposed to be good for two years it's only supposed to be good for

01:05:34.00 a year I'll leave it doesn't sound like it's good for a year anyway yeah not in

01:05:38.20 my not in my whack-ass fridge I like you're coming at us for [ __ ]

01:05:44.09 screwing up the experiments I got an apple in a fridge right now

01:05:48.08 that's been there since December 9th of last year so I can put it in any fridge

01:05:52.13 do I need to plug the fridge and you have a broken fridge there have been

01:05:55.18 three different level levels of effort and the result is the same for everyone

01:05:59.23 there's no apple to eat no I got an apple we're gonna eat we're just gonna

01:06:03.23 die eating it you're gonna eat a bag of mush it's already it's already a

01:06:07.21 collapses we are going to eat a bag of mush we you

01:06:12.04 and I together we already said so before you know it was gross you've already

01:06:17.05 agreed if you can put it in the next Bean hole it's like I don't know do like

01:06:22.12 an apple dish maybe maybe we'll both for

01:06:24.09 me that's interesting buffer mush oh man

01:06:27.01 yeah we throw it in with the bobbing for apple and if you get that one you lose

01:06:31.08 in a lot of ways oh all right well uh yeah I guess we'll

01:06:35.14 talk to you next time tell people or don't listen again maybe uh buy some

01:06:40.08 [ __ ] or don't whatever uh I'm putting the same amount of effort into the outro

01:06:45.14 that Andrew put into the well I'd rather I should say the Gavin put into the.
