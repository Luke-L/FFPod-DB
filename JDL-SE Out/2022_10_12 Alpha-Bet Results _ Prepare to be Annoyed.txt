00:00:07.22 [Music]

00:00:14.22 Hello and welcome to another episode of the F**kFuckFacePodcast I believe this is

00:00:21.08 number 124 in a series of uh little chat sessions that we have my name is Geoff.

00:00:31.19 Ramsey and with me as always Gavin Free and uh Andrew Panton oh yeah when does a

00:00:38.04 little chat session become a large chat session once the cut off because I feel

00:00:43.05 like I would say these are at least medium chats what uh uh 90 minutes is

00:00:47.07 when it becomes a large chat session okay 90 minutes so we're right under the

00:00:51.19 threshold we're pretty close I think so well this is a double recording so this

00:00:55.11 is technically a very large chat that is

00:00:57.17 true does the chat stop between episodes I think it keeps going

00:01:02.11 no I think that they're two distinct chats they have Beginnings middles and

00:01:08.17 ends yeah fair play hmm I don't know if I agree I I also I gotta be honest I

00:01:14.08 don't know that it [ __ ] matters in any way whatsoever I don't know

00:01:18.05 I'm glad Eric's here on time that was the that was the risk that Eric was

00:01:21.14 going to be slightly late but I was worried because I assume we're gonna get

00:01:25.22 into some arguments this episode based on how well we did our food challenge

00:01:30.09 really we might need a money that extra couple of judges

00:01:35.10 well I have everything documented I wrote down all the things I will say

00:01:40.08 confidently I I think I have one strike I think I have definitively at least one

00:01:45.16 maybe there will be some arguing over multiples but but I feel like I've got

00:01:50.14 one I also certainly have a strike or two

00:01:53.11 what about you uh uh well I guess mine would depend on well you know here's the

00:01:59.11 deal we uh we work in a creative industry we are creative individuals and

00:02:05.04 as a group where I think we're highly creative so I think if you take

00:02:10.08 creativity into account I don't know that I have any strikes I

00:02:14.11 what I expect is that you seem to think that this is all an elaborate prank

00:02:19.18 against you oh I absolutely I do yeah but I'm not upset about it or anything

00:02:24.19 uh I just uh I just don't for a second believe that g for Gavin P for Patton

00:02:29.07 and you for [ __ ] you Geoff oh uniform I felt really dumb after the fact that we

00:02:34.18 none of us put together uniform the thing you created you created the bet

00:02:39.12 you got the you for uniform well I think to be fair I may have created the the

00:02:45.13 corporate structure and the idea behind it but I think Gavin actually named it

00:02:49.03 really okay if we go back in time I'm pretty sure Gavin came up with the name

00:02:53.17 well I was just trying to find a pun for meat that you would wear

00:02:57.10 yeah no okay it's coming back now that makes sense that was that was the brush

00:03:03.03 fire that started uh the Statewide Raging Fire that uh that destroyed all

00:03:07.05 the homes at that moment huh okay I have a lot to talk about uh outside of this

00:03:11.23 food oh my God yeah should we yeah come on man well we've got to address

00:03:18.19 listen look deeply saddened deeply saddened uh

00:03:26.01 uh uh by the loss of Coolio uh he was he was a very young 59 years old that is

00:03:33.16 far too young to be taken from this Earth and uh what a rare talent and uh

00:03:38.18 the co it just really unfortunately coincided with the day that sausage took

00:03:44.01 came out where we I think Geoff decided he was on our list of people to send the

00:03:50.01 cursed socks to yes which we didn't we haven't even cursed the socks yet so I I

00:03:55.06 like we did not send the man and he cursed anything uh as far as I know

00:03:59.21 those socks don't even exist yet uh it's true I haven't cursed a single sock but

00:04:05.02 like I was I was like in disbelief last night when we found out yeah I was just

00:04:10.06 thinking like what what are the chances of that and I also

00:04:14.18 thought man if we'd somehow already got the socks out to him yeah I wouldn't be

00:04:18.21 able to do this podcast anymore like yeah no I think we'd all have to I think

00:04:23.15 that would be uh that'd be a curtain call for all of us really it honestly

00:04:28.23 it's just got me terrified about that sucks

00:04:31.14 I kind of don't want to do it well we have to we're already committed to that

00:04:34.17 but we don't have to send them to anybody that's for sure

00:04:39.03 uh in and and all of that happened uh on the same day that uh that a hurricane

00:04:45.04 named Ian struck I didn't even think about that oh are you serious that was

00:04:50.11 the name of it that was the name of the hurricane hurricane

00:04:55.10 what's going on we have to stop yeah it was why don't we take a break why don't

00:05:01.12 we and right here I don't know that it's a dark way to End

00:05:07.13 season four look it's we have to okay okay yeah yeah no so this is it this is

00:05:12.16 the end of season four we'll we'll take about a 10 minute break before we start

00:05:17.14 season five okay in recordings of episodes 124 and 125. No just

00:05:21.16 just to karmically make it makes me feel pretty uh pretty dirty I don't know why

00:05:27.04 uh feel real bad yesterday was a was it was a really sad day in a lot of ways I

00:05:31.16 don't know why you feel sad this is Gavin's fault I mean this is entirely on

00:05:35.03 him he put the this the cursed sock he has the curse I don't think you or I

00:05:39.15 really have anything to do with this Ian on the other hand

00:05:42.18 that's you know maybe a little bit more spread out I think it's it's more fair

00:05:47.20 to say that Gavin killed Coolio so I sort of a guilt by association

00:05:53.02 maybe your cat did have you checked Geoff to see if our.

00:05:55.16 Coolio cards have gone up in value since this I know I feel like that would be

00:05:59.14 that would be opportunistic and insensitive well I don't want to sell it

00:06:03.11 I would never sell my I was just curious if there is a shift in the market we I

00:06:07.21 you know it's the legend I don't know I don't know but I will tell you that

00:06:13.05 um that the that my card has become Priceless to me now oh absolutely it was

00:06:18.16 a prized possession before but now it's like it's ratcheted up in like personal

00:06:23.01 value I think it was maybe his only autograph

00:06:26.18 card there may have been one other I don't remember if it was an autograph

00:06:30.16 card or not but he was in like a hip-hop trading card set

00:06:34.12 so it's it's a rare card got a rare Coolio pretty rare card

00:06:39.12 oh man well we we lost a good one uh we did yeah we did I'm glad uh the socks

00:06:44.16 didn't go through as long as nothing happens to who else do we say we're

00:06:48.07 gonna send to Keenan and Kell and Jackie Chan don't don't reinforce it man I'm

00:06:52.07 not saying is there anyone else we wanted to send the socks to

00:06:55.16 I don't think we should send it to anyone

00:06:58.22 I don't think we need to give away any any promo socks does it only work if

00:07:04.18 it's not intentional uh do you think if we sent somebody a sock as like a threat

00:07:10.08 of sorts would that be okay no but that works even worse I I mean that that's

00:07:14.19 the threat that's that sounds criminal well I'm not saying like a serious

00:07:20.07 threat I'm just you know a little a little intimidation potentially who do

00:07:24.12 you want to intimidate hmm who do I want

00:07:28.01 to intimidate that's a great question uh I would want to intimidate uh

00:07:33.01 I don't know all the like sports teams I care about are in in on fire or like in

00:07:37.21 the trash in some way it feels useless to try to leverage a Sports Advantage

00:07:42.06 everyone's already in the hole that's a great point I don't really have

00:07:45.17 anyone I need Vengeance against at this moment but I'm just I'm throwing it out

00:07:48.23 something something for you to hold on to for sure yeah the thing that I love

00:07:54.03 the most about this start to this podcast is how morbidly quiet Gavin is

00:07:58.13 the whole thing because I know he is legitimately deeply troubled which I

00:08:03.14 think is so odd for Gavin who is a man of science and doesn't believe in

00:08:09.16 anything uh uh like yeah I super don't I

00:08:12.09 I love being a skeptic of this [ __ ] but it is haunting yeah I would be so

00:08:16.15 goddamn mad if I was Edgar Wright listening to Gavin be all upset and

00:08:21.04 solemn about a thing completely unrelated and joyfully talking about an

00:08:26.10 event that I got pissed on did his family we don't know really hoping to get

00:08:31.18 pissed on and we don't know that he got pissed it's almost certain he got pissed

00:08:35.23 on based that he said look if he I'm gonna have to start working on a new

00:08:40.00 guilt basket if that's the case yeah I think I think I know Gavin pretty well

00:08:45.10 after all these years and I would say that the guilt runs deep and Gavin and I

00:08:50.15 wouldn't be surprised if on his deathbed he still feels bad about potentially

00:08:54.18 being associated with urine going on Edgar Wright yeah

00:08:59.09 he'll be 98 years old and he'll still be thinking about it he'll be thinking

00:09:03.19 about that like the five things he has to be feel guilty or embarrassed about

00:09:07.06 in his life but that's not that's not a level of embarrassment you just walk

00:09:11.11 away from nuts and it's through blood too it's not even I didn't even do it I

00:09:16.09 didn't abuse on him that's true and I still feel like you'll

00:09:20.08 be scared to talk to Edgar right you still will be avoiding him at that age

00:09:23.18 your final words he'll come in you'll be on your deathbed and you know

00:09:28.06 like the big reveal or whatever like your fighter where you'll be like come

00:09:32.21 closer I need to tell you something.

00:09:35.18 [Applause]

00:09:40.13 Um I was sort of because I kept ending up with him I was I feel like my

00:09:45.02 confidence was actually building up like I might have said something and then um

00:09:49.07 then this is before I heard the piss story and then we were both going

00:09:54.04 through like the automated passport okay thing at the same time and um mine my

00:09:59.10 door didn't open yeah so uh I took my passport out and tried to put it in but

00:10:04.16 I dropped it outside of the little gate and then I got locked out it closed

00:10:11.00 my bag was just stuck in the in the bit with the camera and

00:10:17.06 I watched that girl right just go straight through it so I was like oh I

00:10:22.04 just wasn't meant to be dude I just had to wave down the guard

00:10:26.21 to be like I'm sorry I got stuck outside the little gate yeah

00:10:31.22 but it said the person said that there were two people in there so I was like I

00:10:35.16 stepped back to be like yeah well maybe I need to reset but as I step back the

00:10:40.06 passport flew out of my hand and slid out under the background

00:10:44.18 dude you were asked when I was on the other side

00:10:48.01 you you were all hot and bothered by Edgar right you're all you were yeah

00:10:54.06 you're a flummoxed by the way Nick asked if piss is thicker than blood

00:10:58.01 which I think is a hilarious hilarious thing to say ah no it's it's so much

00:11:02.17 worse because he's like a oh he's like a hero of mine so it's like you really

00:11:05.19 don't want to goof I would much rather not say anything to him than make a goo

00:11:09.23 for myself well here's here's I have two thoughts here about this gav uh that

00:11:14.02 I've been actually thinking about for a little bit uh one uh and this just I

00:11:18.17 think further illustrates my point with your uh either your passport fumble uh I

00:11:23.21 think the universe was intervening like it was if it had happened if you had

00:11:29.05 crowbarred the Edgar Wright conversation in and this is by the way this is why I

00:11:35.01 stand by my assertion that you should never meet your Heroes never meet anyone

00:11:39.03 you look up to that is why I will if I see Howard Stern or David Lynch walking

00:11:42.19 down the street I am turning around the other way I don't want anything to do

00:11:48.17 with them uh because the best thing you can do like a you get a hundred on the

00:11:52.09 test that like that grade you get that grade for not embarrassing yourself

00:11:57.19 everything else that can happen is worse than that and so what probably would

00:12:01.22 have happened is you he you would have rubbed him the wrong way and he would

00:12:05.16 have given you a pithy response or you would have fumbled and embarrassed

00:12:08.15 yourself and you would have just been torn up about it or whatever it is every

00:12:12.08 time Edgar Wright movies come out you would go to watch it and you would

00:12:15.13 remember that and you would feel a little bad about yourself and a little

00:12:18.14 shittier and it would ruin a little bit of Edgar Wright for you so the universe

00:12:21.20 was doing you a huge solid by by keeping you two apart also my other thought is

00:12:26.20 you say it's not your fault guilt by association you clearly know what your

00:12:31.02 family is capable of you went out in public with them uh you have you you

00:12:35.08 should have known better I fulfilling my family's usually good I guess it's just

00:12:39.03 like everyone's new to the traveling like it was everyone's first time

00:12:43.05 traveling with this new child so I think that's just like learning curves

00:12:49.05 happening yeah usually it's a pretty inoffensive family just minding its own

00:12:54.21 business I promise do you have that with any celebrities Geoff like you have a

00:13:00.02 experience or interaction that has changed the way you look at them and now

00:13:03.17 whenever you see their work you think about them in a different way like it

00:13:08.18 well for you I mean I feel like I've told my my Charles Barkley Story one

00:13:13.02 million times absolutely but that did I mean that that's where this comes from

00:13:18.12 right like and I'm I'll be honest with you I'm fairly neurotic about it uh I I

00:13:23.07 really don't want to meet if someone wants to meet me that's fine uh I got no

00:13:27.22 problem with that but I don't want to meet anyone else that I look up to or I

00:13:32.05 admire um and it all stems from meeting Charles.

00:13:35.15 Barkley when I was 17. Yeah and it did ruin he was he and Larry Bird were my

00:13:41.13 heroes and Bird was on his way out uh because his back was was falling apart

00:13:47.23 and Charles was kind of at the height of

00:13:49.21 his of his uh abilities as an NBA player

00:13:53.00 uh and well oh he's still on the come up a little bit actually because he had

00:13:57.01 some really good years of the Suns um but uh and so I and he was from

00:14:00.21 Alabama and I just didn't growing up in Alabama I never I never liked Alabama I

00:14:04.11 never connected with Alabama there weren't a lot of people that I looked up

00:14:09.03 to from Alabama you know I had like I don't have a lot of

00:14:11.21 great famous Role Models you know I had [ __ ] Jimmy Buffett which was like his

00:14:17.20 whatever that's fine uh I had Karen which was cool and I had Charles bar

00:14:22.22 that's a good one and uh yeah and so um I was beyond crestfallen and I I didn't

00:14:27.11 like him for years and years and years after that and it wasn't until the NBA

00:14:33.00 on TNT and when I I just was so impossibly entertained by the guy

00:14:36.06 again and I really I uh I fell back in love with him and now I love him more

00:14:39.16 than I ever did when I was a kid do you have any of those Gavin would this add

00:14:43.18 on to it or would Edgar Wright be your first one where your view of their work

00:14:47.18 would forever be changed I don't think I've ever had one to that extent no it's

00:14:52.09 good yeah I think I've always done I've always done okay have you ever had one

00:14:56.01 with content where it wasn't even like a personal interaction it was just like

00:15:00.17 something they did changed how you looked at them as an actor or performer

00:15:04.07 in some way yeah

00:15:08.22 that's fair that's fair I met within the

00:15:11.20 work itself I'm not saying good anything personal that's like a deep dark secret

00:15:17.15 I'll just I'll just spin this around because that was too expensive

00:15:22.06 I'm just cutting like so much is that what's happening

00:15:26.04 I don't think it needs to be cut no I'm gonna I'll pivot to a thing I think Geoff

00:15:31.18 you and I have talked about this in the past and I'm sure we could relate on

00:15:36.16 this there's a character in the TV show The Shield where something happens to

00:15:42.20 them later in the show that is so no unexpected and jarring it's all I can

00:15:47.20 see that like it's all I think about when I see that actor regardless of

00:15:51.05 whatever role that person does all I think about what scene are you what

00:15:55.08 character are you referring to uh oh man it's been so long I don't remember the

00:16:00.12 names of Veda I want to say season five something horrible like truly horrible

00:16:06.05 characters and it's all I think about when I see them because it was so

00:16:11.07 jarring and unexpected I've never seen any other show do that like it's just I

00:16:16.06 that I cannot disassociate that moment from that guy I thought maybe you were I

00:16:19.11 was trying to think of like most shocking moments in the show and I

00:16:22.16 thought no there's a lot in that show women's head gets the grenade or like

00:16:27.09 when Ronnie and yeah meets the oven you know I gotta watch this show it was a

00:16:32.12 great show listen Gus once described it to me as like uh sitting down and having

00:16:36.17 a series of tiny heart attacks for one hour at a time uh once a week and that's

00:16:42.04 what the show is like it is intense that's what Ozark was like for me I

00:16:46.21 haven't seen it yet Mozart was very good but it was a lot slower

00:16:50.01 a lot slower than the shield you know one of the things I think most about

00:16:53.04 when I think the shield Chef which is funny because it's like as you said it

00:16:57.01 is a series of endless heart attacks the acting is so intense it's like there's

00:17:00.15 so many different crazy arcs you go through one of the first things I I

00:17:05.07 think about and that stuck with me with that show is a random subplot in season

00:17:09.18 one where there's a a dispute like a domestic dispute between these people

00:17:15.23 and somebody spray paints the word hoe across their front door and like red

00:17:19.16 letters and they they talk to the person

00:17:21.17 then they go back to the house later and it says shoe like they just added an S

00:17:25.17 to it because they didn't know how else to fix it so they just made it a

00:17:30.04 different word that gag has stuck with me for years it's the main thing I think

00:17:34.06 about that show there's so many insane intense moments that I just think of

00:17:39.04 hodashu when I think of the shield that's perfect I I also have like some

00:17:42.19 vivid graffiti cover-up memory from a show from Alan Partridge someone spray

00:17:47.15 paints [ __ ] piss Partridge on his car and he uh he asked someone to fix it for

00:17:52.04 him and then he the reveal is that they just sprayed new letters on it it says

00:17:55.18 cook past babitrage and that's it's just like one of those things that's also

00:17:59.20 just burned visually into my into my head funny how those are the same gag

00:18:04.23 uh well did we cover all the all the heavy news so that we could talk about

00:18:09.20 our contest though I think I just realized we're [ __ ] we're 20 minutes

00:18:13.02 in I feel like we should go into the alphabet we got a lot to discuss well I

00:18:16.09 guess depending on how much gets it got cut or maybe we're two minutes in I'm

00:18:19.13 not sure I have a feeling that you've completely [ __ ] this since my Geoff out

00:18:24.20 of paranoia That You Were Somehow the butt of a joke uh okay that's my my

00:18:28.21 assumption I I have a few ideas because we had a little text conversation last

00:18:34.03 night and you implied that you did something maybe not intended you went

00:18:38.00 off the path but was creative I I've speculated in my my own head I thought

00:18:42.13 maybe you went for the most strikes possible I'm excited to see your list

00:18:47.07 has everybody written down no I just took I just took photos of my stuff okay

00:18:52.06 I wrote down everything okay I wrote down mine should we just

00:18:57.01 post this or let's go one at a time let's go one at a time so let's go

00:19:01.22 alphabetically uh you okay not the letter U but you as an Andrew okay uh

00:19:06.14 let me let me copy and paste my Monday it's gonna do my first day

00:19:10.22 I'll talk to you about the adversity I I encountered the first day immediately

00:19:16.04 okay going with Monday first thing I did [Laughter]

00:19:19.21 pancakes six things yeah that was that's what I ate pineapple well pineapple

00:19:25.09 chunks and popcorn could be next to nothing yeah those were like snacks yeah

00:19:29.21 there's throw away snacks so I had pancakes I realized after I had ordered

00:19:35.07 the pancakes I cannot put butter on them it's a real issue dry pancakes are not

00:19:40.09 nearly as enjoyable as the thing I was all excited I was like I'm gonna start

00:19:44.06 my day with some pancakes some potato patties we're getting this off on a good

00:19:48.19 foot I can't use butter I feel it could be against the rules if I use butter so

00:19:52.21 that was brutal uh then it's got some nice pecan pie sounds brutal oh it was

00:19:57.17 terrible it was a tough way to start I had to really bounce back from that this

00:20:03.04 is pecan pie wanted pumpkin didn't have any at the store it was tragic once

00:20:06.17 again a hash brown a potato Patty by the way no it's a potato Patty okay what do

00:20:11.08 you mean never heard that never heard the word potato Patty before my life I

00:20:14.23 will send you uh I'll send you the product I'm gonna assume it's a Canadian

00:20:18.04 thing I I I'm not gonna I'm not gonna knock it I just agree with Gavin I think

00:20:21.19 it's a hash brown probably well if it was a hash brown a hash brown is 100

00:20:26.02 potato how would that look okay so the answer to Gavin's question is yes.

00:20:31.03 I'm just saying I I don't if you want to

00:20:34.02 give me a strike for potato Patty that's fine no no uh

00:20:38.19 I was just clarifying I I appreciate the creativity of it I like that it's good

00:20:44.05 it's too it's like there's a yeah no it's nice it's fun to say potato Patty

00:20:49.03 it's uh it's like the McDonald's hash brown that's a definite potato Patty I'd

00:20:53.10 say okay so again when he asked if it was a hash brown and you did the song

00:20:57.17 and dance the answer was yes well I'm just you know different words

00:21:01.18 for different things I think that's the pain I like I like

00:21:05.02 where you go with that just remember different words for different things

00:21:08.11 when it's my turn okay I really appreciate that we uh

00:21:12.07 oh that's unfortunate anyway we're moving on uh to Pineapple Chunk set.

00:21:16.15 Supply because McDonald's is offering pineapple so I got some pineapple from.

00:21:21.06 McDonald's it's delicious got a few bags carried me through the week potentially

00:21:25.04 in some ways rental popcorn and the end of the day pepperoni pizza it was

00:21:29.16 delicious and that was my Monday that was um on that I have to reference the

00:21:33.18 text conversation we were in [Laughter]

00:21:37.15 um Monday 8 P.M Andrew texts Geoff and myself I couldn't put butter on my

00:21:42.06 pancakes this morning but we are holding

00:21:46.02 strong and then a picture of a pepperoni pizza stay strong everyone we can do

00:21:52.02 this neither of us replied no no I had nothing to say to that person oh

00:21:58.03 sorry do you want me to continue on with my day real quick question do you now

00:22:03.22 does pineapple chunk does that count as a pea for pineapple or c for chunk I

00:22:08.07 think it's a definite

00:22:10.06 uh continue please do we got any strikes on Monday

00:22:15.07 I mean I think potato patties is uh I mean if I wish you would if you took a

00:22:19.13 photo of it and it's like there's a box that says potato patties uh then that

00:22:24.04 would help but I don't care based on what I've got coming up I would like to

00:22:28.18 not strike any of that yeah I'm kind of in the same boat I'll

00:22:32.17 uh you know what I'll drop in Discord photo of uh what I what I consume while

00:22:38.02 I do that I will copy and paste my Tuesday Tuesday items we have a

00:22:42.14 continuation of sorts I I finished off my pancake from the previous day

00:22:46.06 couldn't get through all of them because a lack of butter this wasn't enjoyable

00:22:51.22 had some more pineapple leftover pepperoni pizza enjoyed some poutine and

00:22:56.12 then we just kind of had some snack items we had uh the peanut butter

00:22:59.18 pretzel I don't know if you've ever had the Kirkland peanut butter pretzel like

00:23:03.15 little little treat thing like a oh it's delicious they're great I had some of

00:23:09.00 those had some peanuts discussed about recently

00:23:11.22 ended the day with pineapple oh you got pineapple that twice I've got Planet

00:23:16.21 because I I kept track of what I ate and went so I had pineapple in the morning

00:23:20.09 had some pineapple at the very end of the day first one of the first things

00:23:24.22 one of the last things I ever ate uh for that day

00:23:27.07 I'll quickly drop in a potato Patty photo McCain's potato patties you win

00:23:32.12 you like you like that guy can't play yeah okay and now Wednesday Wednesday is

00:23:37.12 my potentially you can argue maybe other strikes I have a definite strike on

00:23:42.18 Wednesday that I will get into okay paste

00:23:46.09 Wednesday we had some more peanut butter pretzels some more peanuts pulled pork

00:23:52.08 let's see the strike this time 10 dark chocolate dark chocolate that was

00:23:57.12 so you want me to get into why what happened with the dark chocolate I would

00:24:02.10 appreciate it I had a bar of dark chocolate on my desk

00:24:06.06 I don't drink I'm not a drinker I'm not a big drinker but I had some cider to

00:24:10.03 celebrate an event it was just in my fridge and I was like you know what I'll

00:24:13.11 have the cider sometimes I have like allergic reactions

00:24:16.11 when I drink alcohol I was all stuffed up I had a headache I felt Tipsy just

00:24:20.23 one cider could really take me down I was not feeling good I was feeling out

00:24:25.03 of it I was like I just need something to like eat right now all this chocolate

00:24:30.19 seems like a great idea that'd be great I love this lint dark chocolate ate half

00:24:35.06 the bar it was so easy to do this I would forget at times and I had moments

00:24:39.13 of panic that I could only eat pea Foods

00:24:42.19 I was halfway through the lint bar and I was like oh God this isn't this isn't

00:24:46.23 this is there's no pee in this I am [ __ ] this is a strike I didn't want to

00:24:51.20 cover it I felt that'd be dishonorable I

00:24:54.07 [ __ ] up I I had a cider lost my Edge a little bit rounded the day out sweet

00:24:59.01 potato fries some pumpkin pie finally found some great Great Dessert great

00:25:03.22 treat perfect for the season fantastic and always and then peaches

00:25:09.09 oh and today I forgot I've only had one thing to eat today

00:25:13.21 I think the perfect way to round out my alphabet Thursday today for my hubby's.

00:25:19.02 Bagels I had a pretzel delicious okay very nice so this is my alphabet these

00:25:25.03 are my things how are we feeling about strikes I know dark chocolate dark

00:25:30.06 chocolate's a strike uh I think that's the only one yeah I think you get one

00:25:33.15 strike buddy wow you did double up a few times but there's no there's no yeah we

00:25:38.16 talked about that yeah two pretzels uh in two well that's two days wasn't it

00:25:42.14 yeah I have I've got a pretzel yesterday

00:25:44.21 and today different pretzel types though

00:25:46.22 the pretzel from my others like a pastry

00:25:46.22 pretzel the snack pretzel is more like a chip almost with peanut butter in the

00:25:51.19 middle it's like a hard salty pretzel uh yeah I

00:25:55.12 think I think you did you did very very well I feel great about this and you

00:26:00.14 know at the once we all talk about it I'll have some more things to discuss

00:30:11.12 internationally October 19th and in North America on October 21st

00:30:17.01 okay uh Gavin okay well I've got pictures so why don't we uh how many

00:30:23.15 photos did you take for this oh [ __ ] a lot okay okay I'm ready

00:30:27.20 um and I'm expecting strikes it was it was more difficult than I thought

00:30:32.20 um so let's say I did a few things if I've not done it I've not taken every

00:30:37.21 picture of every meal so I had this a few times

00:30:42.07 all right so we got some green grapes and Greek yogurt yogurt yep

00:30:48.16 another morning I had some of these uh oh yeah okay those are gross by the way

00:30:54.01 that is uh that was the worst thing I ate that was overnight grains are

00:30:59.10 absolutely disgusting that was some soggy [ __ ]

00:31:02.12 I'm not gonna throw a strike on you for the Greek yogurt but I just really like

00:31:08.02 the idea of referring to what you're eating as Greek that's the food you're

00:31:11.20 just eating Greek double Greek just remember that you didn't you didn't

00:31:15.14 strike him for that thank you very much and I seem to have not taken a picture

00:31:19.18 of it but you can see it in the top right corner of my green grapes and

00:31:24.20 Greek yogurt picture there's some uh some Goldfish I had some of this oh it

00:31:29.15 was a snack um back in the old favor I'd have to go

00:31:33.01 to my favorites every time that'll be good uh we had as some snacks

00:31:37.23 that's a good one and another morning I had just some straight up granola okay

00:31:45.10 just had that I poured that into the Greek yogurt that morning

00:31:49.11 you poured it into the Greek is what you mean yeah I put it into the Greek yeah

00:31:54.23 the problem with what you're doing here though Gavin and I'm sure I'm guilty of

00:31:58.09 this too is you're using Goldfish crackers so you're focusing on the brand

00:32:03.09 for goldfish and you're ignoring you're not referring you don't say I ate kind I

00:32:08.09 had a thing of kind yeah what he's doing what he's doing is he's setting a

00:32:12.02 baseline that's gonna help me out a lot now the reason I thought that'd be okay

00:32:16.03 I know we weren't gonna go for like an Oreo isn't an oh it's a cookie right but

00:32:20.23 they are shaped like a goldfish so I thought that made it more okay you know

00:32:25.09 what yeah that's fine maybe a half strike on that based off that okay

00:32:29.12 you've removed me I don't think it's a strike at all.

00:32:32.20 Eric's wrote written question marks go ahead Eric you you think it counts

00:32:37.16 because

00:32:39.12 well I thought it might help me a little bit more

00:32:43.00 again I don't have a vote in here I think that there was some stuff that

00:32:47.10 Andrew had that was on the line I think there's some stuff that you have that's

00:32:50.23 flagrant but again I don't have a vote so I'm gonna you know we'll just keep

00:32:56.05 I'm curious to see what else he got garden vegetables you're insane that's

00:33:01.08 crazy okay that one that one I might deserve a strike on

00:33:05.11 um what I also I got pretty adventurous because I was running out of ideas had

00:33:10.16 myself for dinner half a pint of gumbo

00:33:17.17 never had that before um uh I also bought as a snack on one of

00:33:23.17 the days some sugar-free gummy bears which I'm told you shouldn't eat a lot

00:33:29.01 of because you're [ __ ] liquid so I only had a few of those for the for the

00:33:34.08 evening a little bit a little bit of gelato nice

00:33:37.12 that's a great one what a flavor is that

00:33:44.23 um now I just I just have to agree with what we were saying earlier where like

00:33:50.17 you used brand name for some stuff and not other stuff and it's making me nuts

00:33:54.20 if you would have had tea I feel like you still would have eaten this because

00:34:00.20 it says talenti so I I think right well but it's Gina right so that counts right

00:34:05.02 but what I'm saying is that you've used brand names for some things but not

00:34:10.11 everything so I feel like if you had tea you still would have eaten this it is

00:34:15.18 seeing some of your pics Gavin it does make I had a conversation before earlier

00:34:20.18 today with Eric in which we had a slight

00:34:24.10 debate whether baked potato count for me so for you with some of the the leaves

00:34:28.10 the Goldfish the kind bar you gotta you got a few extensions here I didn't know

00:34:33.12 whether this one oops oh that's too big that one isn't it stupid how some photos

00:34:38.01 are too big and others aren't makes no sense yeah

00:34:41.14 um okay you ready are you ready for for a strike I'm oh I can't wait am I going

00:34:45.21 to slack now this no no no uh no the the one that didn't post oh I'll give it to

00:34:50.18 you later it was a ginger shot which I didn't know whether it was food or not

00:34:55.17 or a drink but it was just like a probiotic ginger juice it's a drink

00:35:00.19 either way that's fine I can send you the fact that it made my oh no I can't

00:35:05.00 see that that's too big as well I'll just go and shove it up my ass next one

00:35:09.01 you want to see the you want to see the strike I want to see the strike so bad

00:35:14.01 this was because uh you know I had people over everyone's ordering the same

00:35:20.07 food uh I had to make do with what I had access to I mean it's just Sushi you

00:35:26.04 just you've had sushi that's not but does it help you that I ordered the.

00:35:29.23 Gandhi's Inferno the Godzilla roll and the Geisha roll

00:35:33.06 I thought you're going to argue that they're green I appreciate that you're

00:35:37.04 with with green the G for what they were called it's still Sushi that's strike

00:35:41.12 yeah none of them were good oh no they're from San Francisco apparently

00:35:46.16 but I think that's just what door Dash is from ah uh let me introduce you to

00:35:51.23 probably my my best meal of the entire event we've got a garden salad with

00:35:57.09 ginger dressing garlic bread some ground beef sauce and some gnocchi

00:36:03.15 that was the most geez I crammed into one meal and uh that one was excellent

00:36:09.09 and uh shout out to Meg Turney for uh getting all that if anything that's

00:36:15.01 probably worth bonus points because you you layered so many G's together

00:36:21.05 I consider doing an all-p pizza but I didn't want to deal with Pickles that

00:36:25.08 was my hindrance well you didn't have to you could have picked other stuff no I

00:36:28.16 would but I wanted it to be for the thing to work I needed all the peas on

00:36:32.14 the menu and that was the one I don't know I know about this because I

00:36:36.13 couldn't want Peppers pineapple pepperoni they had pine nuts I wasn't

00:36:40.08 sure where that would fall uh and the pickles was the distract or there I I

00:36:45.04 that's as you said Geoff great great use of cheese Gavin yeah thanks uh let me

00:36:50.10 see if I can get those uh those ones didn't work real quick here we go

00:36:53.18 um it was it was this one oh it seems to be working that was the uh okay Ginger

00:36:58.08 shot the ginger shot yeah that's the beverage that's a drink that's not

00:37:03.10 you're fine okay and it did no never mind the other one didn't take

00:37:07.06 yeah also in addition I know it did we weren't doing drinks but I exclusively

00:37:12.03 drank grapefruit flavored sparkling water

00:37:14.20 I like that you didn't actually eat any grapefruit though you only drink it I

00:37:19.01 like that bubbly that's good water yeah I like it

00:37:22.06 and and that's me I'm done I don't remember the order but uh that was

00:37:26.12 everything I ate sightseeing conservatively Gavin maybe one and a

00:37:30.17 half strikes I'm gonna go with one I think one I think you've seen one yeah

00:37:35.08 what's the other strike goldfish I'm totally on board with the goldfish

00:37:38.13 goldfish

00:37:40.12 goldfish and garlic bread because that's bread

00:37:45.00 no you ate garlic and Greek and goldfish and you're giving me garden vegetable

00:37:50.05 soup I mean yeah you did so well in other areas all right

00:37:56.12 all right uh yeah I mean we'll do one and a half strikes how about that what

00:38:01.11 about okay how about we have our ratings Eric how many strikes would you give

00:38:05.08 Gavin oh that's this is good I mean that table

00:38:08.10 it shouldn't even I shouldn't probably be involved I think that the gelato to

00:38:13.18 me is like that's fine but then the Goldfish aren't I also don't think.

00:38:19.19 Progresso soup is a g the granola is fine the kind bar I get yeah you could do

00:38:28.00 that because it's a granola bar the overnight grains I don't agree with I

00:38:33.00 don't think overnight green should count what is that then just parfait yeah or

00:38:38.17 overnight grains which would be oh but it's grains yeah this is the Big Potato

00:38:44.05 it's baked potato I think Andrew's sweet potato should be a strike no that's a

00:38:48.13 vegetable it's different to a potato that's not sweet potato if we're doing

00:38:52.17 vegetable pea would be potato sweet potato would be S baked potato sweet

00:38:57.16 potato isn't a potato with sugar on it it's a different vegetable foreign

00:39:04.15 could you quietly I think I think if I was giving Gavin strikes I think I could

00:39:10.18 settle for two and be comfortable but if you guys want to go with one and a half

00:39:15.12 it would be fine I just wanna in the background could you just do your own

00:39:18.22 strikes and at the end we could just hear your perspective on where the

00:39:23.07 strikes are sure so now we move on to you Geoff the floor

00:39:26.21 is yours I'm so excited uh okay so much like Gavin I didn't take uh I didn't

00:39:31.23 write down what I ate when I ate it I just took a picture of everything I ate

00:39:37.08 and uh I will say also um not to uh play the heart strings uh here for you guys

00:39:42.19 but um I have a very sick dog here and he

00:39:45.23 had to go to the hospital for 24 hours and so I didn't eat a lot during this

00:39:49.19 period because I was running around back

00:39:51.14 and forth because Henry has pneumonia uh he's fine now he's he's Jacqueline he's

00:39:55.21 doing better uh but it was a stressful like 24 hours for me and so it was a

00:39:59.20 little hard for me to follow along uh it's a good picture of Gavin for some

00:40:03.21 reason oh it went through that was the one of that's what the ginger shot did

00:40:07.14 to my face sorry to interrupt this nice uh so uh

00:40:11.02 nice I uh I feel like I was faced with the with the a really difficult letter

00:40:16.18 in you you absolutely were uh it's odd that that was the letter we chose to to

00:40:24.01 dissect as a difficult letter in the previous episode and then suddenly you

00:40:29.10 miraculously pulled it uh but whatever uh not to be deterred I uh I did my best

00:40:35.18 I started out I ate a lot of these over the week uh I got some Uncrustables

00:40:41.19 that's uh

00:40:44.04 my mom it literally says 58 grams of sandwiches

00:40:49.21 uh it's Uncrustables they start with you they have I got them in peanut butter I

00:40:55.16 got them in Gray or sorry uh strawberry I got them in grape as well I didn't

00:40:59.05 take a photo of the grape this one might

00:41:02.07 be a little bit more of a stretch but uh for a snack along with the uncles I

00:41:08.06 found uh uh these things Eric is not gonna be happy with these no

00:41:12.10 it's uh if I'm losing you here things are going to get worse

00:41:17.06 it's only just begun UTS is the brand uh that they make us

00:41:23.23 balls I think they're called so that I feel like that counts uh by the way

00:41:28.15 they're great uh my family has fallen in love with UTS we're gonna eat a lot uh

00:41:32.20 as you know that Monday night I had to go out to dinner with my daughter for

00:41:36.14 her 17th birthday uh you I asked you guys specifically we were gonna go get

00:41:40.04 sushi I said can I go to can I go to a place called Uchi because it starts with

00:41:44.01 a u and you said no you can't go to that restaurant doesn't count so I didn't I

00:41:48.01 went to the sister restaurant uchiko it's a totally different place uh and if

00:41:53.02 I'm being honest with you and I think Gavin will back this up I think it's

00:41:56.04 better anyway for proof uh here is here's a picture

00:41:59.18 Millie took of me walking in the door at uchiko uh I didn't take it blind

00:42:05.07 better I didn't say I was I was posing uh I didn't uh I didn't take any photos

00:42:11.02 of any of the uchiko stuff I ate inside but it all started with a u there was

00:42:16.03 you stay there was you tuna uh there's udamame uh one of Geoff's pictures of

00:42:21.20 what he ate is the picture of a roof of a building

00:42:26.01 uh then uh for breakfast the next morning breakfast is difficult can we

00:42:30.10 put this picture of you going into the restaurant on a shirt this isn't this is

00:42:36.04 yeah what an insane picture listen listen you can put that photo on a shirt

00:42:39.18 right after you put uh bingo can't do it on a shirt that's got to come first you

00:42:44.08 go we'll talk about it so I'm pretty sure you're reaching for the wrong side

00:42:47.20 of the door isn't that the hinge you're reaching if I wasn't reaching I I wasn't

00:42:51.20 reaching for anything I was uh opposing uh with my hand out to say like here is

00:42:55.04 uh uchika uh breakfast was difficult well no before we move away from the

00:42:59.10 photo there's a reflection in the door of somebody a ghostly reflection of

00:43:04.19 someone who seems terrified is that a mirror that's yeah

00:43:08.10 no yeah that's uh no that's an employee who's wondering why we're taking 45

00:43:12.03 [ __ ] photos

00:43:13.23 a character in The Walking Dead

00:43:18.12 at The Telltale Game when he does

00:43:24.03 okay so breakfast uh hopefully you guys are with me so far and I don't have any

00:43:30.02 strikes uh we'll see about this one uh turns out

00:43:33.07 there's something you can eat for breakfast called unicorns uh so I had them

00:43:39.08 waffles that's the great the waffles yeah oh is my thumb covering I don't

00:43:43.10 know I don't know that that's you missed it it's called Kellogg's universe

00:43:48.02 ah oh I'm not sure if that's for this box anyway uh those uh those also like

00:43:54.04 her waffle in the bottom left those right there they taste like [ __ ] they're

00:43:59.01 cotton candy they look terrible they're [ __ ] disgusting uh I didn't enjoy any

00:44:02.23 of this week by the way everything sucked that I had to eat uh for lunch

00:44:06.12 that day I believe it was uh I had uh keep it with the Unicorn theme I had

00:44:12.06 some unicorn shapes for lunch they were pretty good I'm not gonna lie

00:44:16.17 they were cheesy

00:44:18.21 those are craft unicorn shapes they're really good look them up it's a food uh

00:44:25.11 yeah I cover up the word craft but it's their craft unicorn uh then for dinner

00:44:30.12 that night I was really proud of this and I think you guys would be with me

00:44:34.06 here I ate from a place called uh Umami Burger so I had an Umami didn't cover

00:44:39.05 burger with your thumb well it's called Umami it says Umami in

00:44:44.02 big letters hang on from um I got a new mommy Burger

00:44:50.18 that's what it's like the number one yeah and and uh and then I had the next

00:44:56.23 day uh uh I had uh for a snack I had uh I might be losing

00:45:02.08 you a little bit on this one uh if we didn't see some Uno noodles or actually

00:45:09.12 that's what I think is impressive I don't think you have a single nut strike

00:45:14.18 I think these are all right strikes for lunch today I had an uh I haven't I

00:45:19.20 haven't you can see the B through the paper

00:45:25.11 um well that that picture was too big so I'll have to

00:45:29.08 I'll have to skip to uh let's see oh man

00:45:32.18 oh I like how some of them don't work on Discord uh I know it makes no sense

00:45:37.23 right I had uh for a snack I had uddy uddies

00:45:42.06 oh those are really good if you ever have them they're chocolateyuddies um

00:45:49.10 presenting this up front you were presenting this like you may have taken

00:45:54.10 some slight Liberties I had some ushers uh which was very good

00:46:02.14 uh you can see right there it says ushers is what those are called uh I

00:46:08.14 also had uh this stuff is great if you

00:46:12.12 ever uh ah [ __ ] this is too big too what

00:46:15.06 a piss take uh hold on let me let me do something with these real fast because

00:46:19.06 these are too good to miss um yeah I had to take screen shots of my pictures

00:46:26.01 this was your game this was your game and you're showing us ushers like what I

00:46:31.14 think it's pronounced ushers uh but I don't know I'm not I'm not

00:46:35.17 entirely uh sure about that and then what was it oh yeah here we go let me

00:46:41.13 take a screens hot of this guy too uh I think I think if you're with me so far I

00:46:46.03 think we're fine and it sounds like you guys I don't think anyone's with you and

00:46:49.11 I don't think there's been any implication that we are even slightly

00:46:53.12 with you see you guys are with me got it

00:46:56.12 uh okay so we'll do uh let's see here we go

00:47:00.20 um oh yeah this isn't I had an this was not very good I had enough to us uh it's

00:47:05.05 sort of a it's like a baked dish uh cylindrical baked dish it's called us uh

00:47:10.03 you can see it right there on the box it's Sam's Sam's choice of us I got that

00:47:14.10 at Walmart now you're in Andrew's territory this is yeah uh then I got uh

00:47:18.23 oh I like this one I think you'll like this one uh put some effort into this

00:47:22.13 one I ate some uh how is that too big I just [ __ ] screenshotted that you

00:47:26.20 gotta be suck my butthole uh let me try again uh all right here we go all right

00:47:30.04 there's no point in counting strikes Eric he is we're in a different inning

00:47:35.04 based off of Geoff's photos I ate some that's unchin unch uh it's like a it's

00:47:40.10 like ancient it's like a snack it's like a snack meal uh it's pretty good I have

00:47:46.05 never seen how mad I am because I'm because it's so funny it's hard to tell

00:47:51.03 I've never seen anyone try so hard yet not try at all I had some unchos these

00:47:56.02 are pretty good it's like a potatoey anchos they're crispy uh I cut those

00:48:00.12 from Walmart as well uh and then you put that you scribbled out the the brand

00:48:05.23 name and not potato crisps anchos is what they're called uh oh

00:48:09.14 right I had this today I had one of these today it's called an up cake uh

00:48:14.23 they're like little footballs on them uh uh those are good you didn't you you

00:48:18.14 went from order and then as long as there was a u somewhere in the food even

00:48:23.08 if it's not in the food and only in the brand name it was good enough for you

00:48:26.11 and then the last thing I had now this one might be a stretch uh I apologize

00:48:30.17 for this one I was losing some steam at the end I had what I like to call an

00:48:35.02 upside down Burger which you might call a Big Mac but if it's upside down I

00:48:39.09 assume that it it would count so I'll take a strike on that one because I feel

00:48:42.19 like that's a little that's a a bridge too far but I feel pretty good about the

00:48:46.05 other hey can I ask why you didn't just do that with all your [ __ ] Foods dude

00:48:50.05 because I I thought of it today foreign

00:49:03.22 here's what you should do between uh Monday of next week and the next

00:49:08.10 recording uh-huh uh you should uh you should do the challenge yeah just not

00:49:13.15 even the challenge just eat one new food just one uh Uncrustables I ate

00:49:18.12 uncrustable that's the same this doesn't count Umami I had umami oh I had udon

00:49:23.21 when I was at uchiko that counts

00:49:31.19 of the inside uchiko what do you mean I don't know I just didn't think too it

00:49:36.22 was like a fancy birthday dinner I want to be like taking photos of food in the

00:49:40.13 dark right but you didn't even tell us that you didn't mention I forgot about

00:49:44.02 it until just now it's the only genuine you you've had

00:49:48.03 I think everything I showed you was a you

00:49:50.21 even when I yelled out I'd be pissed if there's no no look I get I get I get

00:49:56.02 that uh that the upside down Burger is probably not right I'll take a strike on

00:49:59.20 that.

00:50:06.04 [Music]

00:50:08.14 Real foods on shows up cakes I I don't know what to

00:50:14.05 tell you I don't know what to tell you yeah

00:50:17.17 they don't I don't feel like you did you did something

00:50:22.06 but you did most of the pictures thank you thanks I also put a lot of work in I

00:50:28.07 painted [ __ ]

00:50:29.13 I had to go buy red paint at the store to paint those bags

00:50:33.21 why didn't you just use red ashes I didn't think too

00:50:39.13 ah anyway uh so I don't know how to determine who won uh but I guess it

00:50:46.03 sounds like I might have more than one strike and so Andrew had one Gavin that

00:50:50.21 one and I guess Andrew you win yeah I think Andrew wins I guess technically I

00:50:54.22 win thanks it doesn't feel great with a equal amount of effort across the board

00:50:59.12 Andrew Woods yeah I wish we did you like first that really that was deflating in

00:51:04.16 a weird way.

00:51:07.20 I'm pretty sure that was the order that needed to go in well

00:51:12.22 should I Eric should I get into what I was gonna talk about 100 yeah no no do

00:51:18.14 we have time no yes he'll go long if we have to uh Geoff confided in me earlier

00:51:24.19 this week and brought it here that he thinks that he's been [ __ ] with Andrew

00:51:31.21 brought his video or photo evidence that he pulled the numbers legally to me and

00:51:37.08 Nick and I don't even know what to tell you guys so let me

00:51:41.04 let me start this has to go to very specific this better not be I recorded

00:51:47.23 I recorded it's not fixed I recorded the numbers being pulled for all of us and

00:51:51.22 uh that evening Gavin and I were talking and I said what do you think the odds

00:51:57.01 because it was ridiculous the ones we pulled I said what percentage of the

00:52:01.01 audience do you think will think that I have somehow rigged this so that I have

00:52:05.17 the easiest letter and I don't remember what you said at

00:52:08.16 that time but you brought up you did record it so you have proof so it's fine

00:52:13.16 it doesn't really matter I was like yeah you know you're right we're all good

00:52:18.13 a few hours later I watched the video okay I'm just sit up in my channel I'm

00:52:23.23 just I need to prepare to be annoyed there we go God I watched the video and

00:52:29.06 I realized I realized I was in deep trouble I've got a real issue in my head

00:52:34.16 Geoff is maybe the worst photo taker in the world

00:52:38.10 I think I might be the worst video taker of all time this is maybe Beyond Geoff

00:52:43.08 level I'm gonna put it why am I catching heat all of a sudden because you're

00:52:47.16 known for your bad stuff I mean look at the picture of the upside

00:52:51.20 down it looks like it was taken in the dock I understand it was I'm just

00:52:56.05 fitting it to let me make sure I get the right thing so I saw this and I thought

00:53:01.06 oh God so I organized a special little recording with Eric and Nick on Monday

00:53:06.16 to show them the proof that I have and to go over I think that will go out at

00:53:11.21 some point soon I'm not sure when exactly so you

00:53:15.20 presented evidence I presented the video evidence that I have

00:53:20.23 uh how do I how do I see this I'm gonna put it in the slack I'm just

00:53:25.18 trying to find it share message how do I how do I do this ah my phone

00:53:34.08 now this is something that could be edited out now I should have prepped

00:53:40.12 this this is on me yeah I think Nick please leave this party okay.

00:53:49.08 I think this is it that's it I think this is it we're gonna send this

00:53:54.06 we're gonna hope that this so it's in the face thing it's uploading right now

00:53:59.07 it is the video of me drawing the ball okay I'm still waiting for it to come

00:54:04.18 through it's loading it's more than halfway but Gavin you were right

00:54:10.03 prepare to be annoyed

00:54:14.09 this is the only video proof I have of the draw 721 you're in

00:54:25.22 the finger in the top of the screen yeah finger and frame

00:54:35.23 drops out rolls up to the floor [Music]

00:54:40.06 and it stops there I didn't I didn't so this is so weird you didn't show the

00:54:46.03 first two numbers be pulled yeah

00:54:51.06 what is interesting is that you're not even filming the top of the ramp or the

00:54:56.07 balls yeah you could have just so dropped it in with your hand well one

00:55:01.11 would assume he his hand his right hand is right above his thumb that you can

00:55:05.17 see in the video and he just drops something into the plastic thing I'm

00:55:09.14 gonna I've gone frame by frame over this

00:55:11.13 video this is the best angle of the ball I have in the video this is the best

00:55:16.06 shot that we get of it going down the Chute I think you could see a 16 if you

00:55:20.12 know what it is by the way it looks like an 18 to me that's what we're printing

00:55:24.08 on the vinyl.

00:55:28.23 [Laughter]

00:55:33.13 Andrew had um I think that they bring up a great point

00:55:38.18 of you're shooting at such a weird angle if you can't see where the numbers are

00:55:43.21 you can't see where the ball comes out you only see this ramp why is that yeah

00:55:48.09 I was about to get into that so the reason why we have the angle that we do

00:55:52.15 is because I was recording in my underwear and it was a reflective

00:55:56.23 everything on the Bingo machine is reflective and I didn't want to be in

00:56:02.08 the machine so I'm actually standing in my bathroom filming the least reflective

00:56:08.22 area of it and I wasn't looking at what I was filming I was looking at the

00:56:13.10 machine the entire time I didn't actually know what I had filmed until

00:56:17.11 that evening but I recognize it looks terrible that made more sense to you

00:56:22.07 than putting shorts on well I didn't know where the shorts were the show is

00:56:25.07 ongoing I don't want to put a pause to any of the action that's happening I

00:56:28.18 mean it took you 45 minutes to show us the video you could have put on 18 pairs

00:56:32.10 of shorts in that time well I didn't plan on it it's fair it's a fair point I

00:56:36.06 didn't plan on it in that moment uh it was it was a mistake the balding cap I

00:56:41.07 asked several people didn't get didn't get many 16s so I took

00:56:46.01 to Twitter I posted that photo you saw yeah and I asked what number do people

00:56:51.10 see almost unanimously by a large majority most people see 18

00:56:57.11 there were 1116s though so there were some people that did see

00:57:03.12 the 16 so I feel like that needs to go in um most definitely sighting and I can

00:57:09.19 see that but if you look at this the still photo of all three of them in

00:57:14.04 their placement the 16 has a real hook on it it's really

00:57:17.19 curved so it makes sense that in the movement the spin the motion yeah I

00:57:23.05 wouldn't make it appear to be an 18 when it is I've been running this back and

00:57:26.13 forth I've been analyzing frame by frame I do believe that is the 16 you know

00:57:30.21 just based on the motion blur pattern as he was saying uh it still doesn't prove

00:57:36.07 that you didn't just drop it further up the machine though

00:57:41.01 yeah if anything your video your video evidence has weakened the case to me

00:57:46.01 that this is legitimate You released a video that doesn't show

00:57:50.14 any of the balls legitimately being pulled

00:57:54.22 I don't know what do you mean by that what do you mean you can't see them go

00:57:58.12 through the machine we just see them show up on a little plastic tray for all

00:58:03.13 I know your mom is dropping them up down the other side first of all

00:58:07.12 for how the machine is designed I'll take photo of the machine nobody knows

00:58:10.20 because we can't see the machine second of all this is the first thing I'm gonna

00:58:15.14 say nobody asked me to bring this forward I am the one who brought all of

00:58:20.20 this to you I was about to run this very episode

00:58:23.11 well you didn't I came first with it right that may be true I believe you in

00:58:27.15 that but I feel like I get points for for stepping forward with this without

00:58:31.23 anyone demanding the proof and coming from the position of I know this looks

00:58:36.21 horrendous you get 16 points for coming forward however you lose 36 points for

00:58:41.14 the poor filming what's impressive negative points is that's only half the

00:58:45.19 amount of strikes that you have the great scheme of things look man I knew I

00:58:50.02 knew going into it I was getting strikes yeah you're the you're brutal like

00:58:54.12 that's what made it worse every as you said and they were very suspicious

00:58:58.15 letters everybody sort of had some connection to the letter it made it feel

00:59:02.15 you'll think when Eric told me that you thought that this is all an elaborate

00:59:06.23 prank against you I'm like I'm I thought I was dead I assumed I was dead going

00:59:12.08 into this with the reveal of what my proof is

00:59:15.09 yeah I still think it was an elaborate prank against me

00:59:18.22 still even after all this yeah I'm even more so because of this oh what huh

00:59:26.10 occurred here that would change Geoff's mind at all you filmed a bingo machine

00:59:31.23 from another room yeah well he didn't film the bigger machine he filmed the

00:59:37.02 tray under the Bingo machine so then you stand to the right and hold your phone

00:59:42.04 at like what what was the big fear about the reflection

00:59:46.00 why because I was a minor way I mean Stand Out The Way of the reflection

00:59:51.13 what are you talking about that's what the video is that's exactly what he did

00:59:56.12 guys that's what happened in the process of doing it he was so focused on the

00:59:59.21 machine he didn't pay attention to what he was looking at I was looking at the

01:00:03.17 machine the whole time not the phone displaying I didn't understand why you

01:00:07.16 had to be in the bathroom because I would reflective because it's

01:00:12.07 a dome it's a plastic Dome that everything messed up in a single frame

01:00:16.15 of this freaking thing

01:00:21.21 you're you're right but me being in the bathroom would allowed me to film the

01:00:26.20 dome but I didn't know I wasn't filming the Dome

01:00:29.20 bathroom would have allowed you to film it correctly and then you didn't anyway

01:00:33.19 yeah because I'm a terrible and filming videos until this started I'm the Geoff

01:00:38.22 videos my fingers in the frame of the video

01:00:42.19 there's a lot of issues I clearly wasn't seeing what was happening I just don't

01:00:47.20 know how you tried so legitimately to do it right but I have no other recourse

01:00:53.18 but to ask you to use your get out of Greg I'm not using it I'm not using it

01:00:59.02 this is Andrew this is insane I'm not you presented it to me Mr judge over

01:01:03.03 here all of a sudden 10 minutes ago I don't want to be involved I don't want

01:01:06.19 to give an opinion now you're laying down the law what are you talking about

01:01:11.14 in or out I think this is I think this is crazy I think this is crazy

01:01:16.14 uh I agree I agree with that but I don't agree with the other thing you know

01:01:22.06 I think.

01:01:25.18 I I think I believe Andrew I definitely sour cream

01:01:29.19 you I wish you could know the fear I wanted to record then I was mad that I

01:01:35.23 didn't look at the video before I was like I'm [ __ ] there's nothing I could do

01:01:41.09 this is terrible I think actually the first person I

01:01:45.04 showed the photo to said what number do you see they said like 56 and I just

01:01:50.18 said I'm [ __ ] there's all I'm in trouble

01:01:54.22 500 replies to what number this is nine of them see eleven or six

01:02:00.01 sixteen I'm mad I'm not even saying the right numbers so flurry it's so blurry

01:02:05.14 and I went frame by frame the issue is that not only did it bounce

01:02:09.09 out of the shoot it bounced while facing the machine the entire time the number

01:02:14.23 is 17.

01:02:16.09 I was trying to look at it in the reflection of the black thing yeah it's

01:02:20.05 tough It's not even in there it's not there I checked I went frame by frame oh

01:02:24.09 so this is what I was gonna do this is these are my offers I'm either willing

01:02:29.23 I'm willing to do this again do do a redraw I'm willing to take this as an r

01:02:35.02 and do it again with r because most people see it as 18.

01:02:38.23 Or if you believe me we could just move on any of those options I think are fair

01:02:44.02 I it was my job to capture the proof I I delivered insufficient evidence there's

01:02:49.21 room for speculation I own that is there a fourth option where I don't

01:02:55.18 believe you and we still move on I mean if you want to sure [Laughter]

01:03:00.10 I'm happy with that one too you don't believe me I believe you I believe you

01:03:06.05 oh man I think I believe you but it it's just so hard

01:03:11.21 I yeah you're such a trickster you're so wildly so here I'm gonna I just took a

01:03:17.12 photo of the machine you see I couldn't rig it because it's a plastic top Over

01:03:22.16 the Hole so you can't just drop in it yeah but I can't I don't see your legs

01:03:27.15 like I'm not crazy like Nick do you see him Nick this is a different angle

01:03:34.15 okay this is a different angle this is the angle Andrew no it's not no no it's

01:03:40.15 not every photo no submit is worse than the last time you should not have said

01:03:45.23 listen no listen to me you [ __ ] idiot Gavin how am I turning the machine on

01:03:52.02 how am I doing it from this angle How's that gonna work how am I gonna activate

01:03:56.18 you said you just have to hit a button and then watch what happens on the other

01:04:02.01 side of the machine oh oh so I'm just gonna hit it I'm gonna

01:04:06.04 walk you want me to walk it'll look like the [ __ ] Blair Witch Project

01:04:10.22 the freaking blurry 56 thing I'm saying if you think the blurry thing is bad

01:04:16.03 that was me standing kinda prepared you want to put movement you want to add

01:04:20.10 actual move to this ton of freaking light on it won't be so blurry it's

01:04:24.17 pretty bright in here I actually don't think [Applause]

01:04:29.16 an Immaculate picture of the machine without I can barely even see your hand

01:04:35.16 yes there's the it's [ __ ] but do you see what I'm saying with the cover

01:04:39.01 you're like you just dropped the ball you can't it goes in the hole on the

01:04:43.18 right and it's a secure plastic box then it rolls down the chute

01:04:47.01 it rolls right towards you what are you talking about it's on the other side of

01:04:51.01 the [ __ ] no you're the ramp is coming to where

01:04:54.12 you're stood I'm going to where what do you mean where I'm stood

01:04:59.08 I'm sad you could have hit the button nipped to this position and the ball

01:05:03.08 would have wronged I'm pulling you another photo right now you don't want

01:05:08.02 to do that um this photo right now I don't think you

01:05:12.07 understand where I am in relation to this machine I think we need to I think

01:05:17.04 you're in the bathroom now right now I'm currently sitting at

01:05:20.15 my desk to record right yeah so you started it like this no I couldn't have

01:05:26.02 I can't reach the button and it turns off every time it goes through.

01:05:29.09 But but so you so operates you have to hold down the button or you just tap

01:05:33.01 push you push the button and typically it gets the ball really quickly and then

01:05:37.08 it turns off and you have to hit the button again to draw it again

01:05:40.18 so by the time I sat down it takes 20

01:05:42.21 seconds for a freaking ball to come it does do you want to know make a video do

01:05:46.03 you want to know why you wanna know why that happened I can get us another photo

01:05:49.05 right now oh boy you would have had enough time to hit the button pick up a

01:05:52.11 sushi container and sit in your chair and it still wouldn't have come out

01:05:55.18 you're right but this is what happened okay I put the thing in I put it in

01:05:59.02 incorrectly I put it in it's not incorrectly so it's

01:06:03.06 uh-huh so the machines doesn't there's no integrity so see the plastic part is

01:06:08.12 sort of at an angle this is getting worse and worse is that so that you can

01:06:13.13 put the 16 directly in the feet no I just didn't notice when I slammed it

01:06:18.09 back down after we did the 16th no no no

01:06:21.03 it is amazing to me no that you have an ability to weaken your case with each

01:06:28.02 new photo it's phenomenal can I fix the machine and then show how quickly it

01:06:34.11 gets the ball can I do that right now Geoff said that he was willing to just

01:06:39.19 say I don't believe you but we can move on and then you started sending

01:06:45.01 photo evidence and now nobody believes you and we're not moving on Nick said

01:06:50.05 this is more intense than watching the saprota film I

01:06:54.01 it's like eventually he's gonna release he's gonna go through all of his photos

01:06:59.04 until eventually it shows him just putting the number 16 on no but this is

01:07:04.10 a box full of 16s to the right let me give me against Eric for a moment the.

01:07:09.23 Baseline was Geoff doesn't believe me but

01:07:11.23 we can move on there's really nowhere to go but down in the fact that I know I'm

01:07:16.03 innocent I didn't do it so I might as well continue to attempt to provide and

01:07:20.09 if nothing changes I just remain where I was.

01:07:24.05 I don't think you were remaining where you were but I don't think you are

01:07:29.09 either I cannot can I attempt to adjust the machine due to a show what I was

01:07:34.08 anticipating as far as how quickly what is that gonna do take us back in time

01:07:38.12 four days like no I'm talking I'm sorry you're saying like why didn't you do

01:07:42.03 this and I said because it immediately turns off once it finds a ball it finds

01:07:45.14 it but why didn't you when you wear shorts we went over that already

01:07:55.02 now this first of all we recorded early I don't remember who did that but we

01:08:00.14 recorded earlier the more the normal on the west coast I woke up I did some

01:08:04.11 stuff for MVP went into the recording didn't expect to be on my bingo machine

01:08:09.01 reflective nobody needs to see that I certainly don't want to see that

01:08:12.23 now I am owning I botched the video the video is terrible it is horrendous it

01:08:16.21 does somehow either you did sell the cream or Greg it I'm sort of fuzzy now

01:08:21.02 in the definition of of both of those but I after all that I still believe you

01:08:26.04 for some reason I think you actually because it's called the 16. None of this

01:08:32.02 is this is all self-inflicted by me once again

01:08:35.14 if if we ever have a face Film Festival that's that that video is the main video

01:08:40.21 I want to see that in a theater with with 200 other people I want to run that

01:08:45.23 still frame through some AI that somehow

01:08:48.19 like d motion blurs yeah and see what it comes out with you that was great

01:08:56.11 he's he's turning on the [ __ ] Bingo machine he could he can't let sleeping

01:09:01.15 dogs lie what does he think that's gonna do enough I have no I what did he think

01:09:07.14 any of this was gonna do what was going to absolve him oh boy

01:09:12.12 I mean Geoff you have to know that we've me and Nick have known about this since

01:09:17.23 Monday and had to sit on it and it has been very difficult dude that is wild

01:09:23.12 let me say uh I don't know how you guys have handled it and that's why I like

01:09:27.09 tell I could tell there was a lot going on yesterday when I was mentioning to

01:09:31.08 you that I thought that uh I I questioned the Integrity of the

01:09:35.15 competition I couldn't tip my hand but at the same time how what is there to

01:09:40.21 believe why was it filmed like that I said I don't know what he's doing

01:09:46.11 I'm trying to fix the machine

01:09:59.07 thank you

01:10:03.04 maybe we should get it I think I got it okay hey guys I think he's got it.

01:10:14.14 I did it some fun one sec

01:10:19.15 it always sounds like he's wrestling his environment like everything that's

01:10:24.12 upright is like falling on him in the background

01:10:28.19 it's like it's like Leslie Nielsen in the Naked Gun when he's on the like or

01:10:33.20 no uh O.J Simpson when he's on the tugboat oh my God he

01:10:38.02 puts his foot in a bad trap and pulls out the window

01:10:41.20 it's his hand on the hot stuff

01:10:51.12 it's so loud see how quick that was how am I going back

01:11:00.20 so is it is it still in the same place now as to where it was in that picture

01:11:07.06 now it drops I I like his point like that it happened so fast he can't get

01:11:12.12 back in time to film from a different angle yet the one video we get to watch

01:11:17.18 was filmed from another room well because it's next to it it's the

01:11:20.23 rooster next to it so you're saying if it's if it's on the fridge you're saying

01:11:25.05 you can't hit the button and sit down and have a video of it coming out

01:11:31.18 yeah not from where I was sitting no hmm I'll try right now yeah

01:11:37.11 I'm gonna put the but the ball back in that I do so he's not he's not filming

01:11:43.08 this or he's filming I don't know yeah you should film it what is this

01:11:48.07 [ __ ] podcast at this point ha ha ha what Have We Become ah oh Lord [Laughter]

01:12:03.04 That sounds like plenty of time

01:12:08.18 ah the shoot malfunctioned.

01:12:15.16 I'm stuck in the chute.

01:12:22.09 I'm not kidding it's stuck to the tray I don't know what it is

01:12:26.23 if I was over there I could just move the Chute and this wouldn't be a problem

01:12:32.08 oh look at that stuck in the Chute the plastic's stuck in the shoot scenario

01:12:40.02 well there you have it another episode of faces in the books

01:12:55.05 that was like 10 minutes of you just incriminating yourself or whatever I'm

01:13:00.14 innocent just watch a man shoot himself in the foot over and over that was the

01:13:07.21 equivalent of sending all your texts to the wrong lawyer I know but I didn't do
