00:00:34.02 So what I did Eric is I texted them the night before and I said

00:00:38.03 is this a regulation salad or is this salad approvable it was a link to a

00:00:41.05 wendy's salad they're like yeah it looks like a good

00:00:43.13 salad so then I used it and Gavin [ __ ]

00:00:45.16 on the salad but what I I'm really glad they didn't

00:00:48.12 notice is I actually swapped salads from that point

00:00:51.14 I picked a different salad than the one that you have

00:00:54.21 agreed on and also you didn't say is this a regulation salad can I do sour

00:00:59.04 cream with a salad you just said what do you think of this salad well I

00:01:03.07 wanted to save this it's a surprise I wanted to wait for the

00:01:07.14 episode and then suddenly you've got strawberries in it well yeah

00:01:11.03 okay so here's the thing I'm not I don't really like blue cheese

00:01:14.07 and I didn't notice that the salad I sent you to blue cheese was in it I was

00:01:17.23 like which is [ __ ] gross dude I don't really want to eat that so I

00:01:21.09 just audibled out swap salad so when you guys are yelling at me about the salad

00:01:24.17 thing I was waiting for one of you to bring up the fact that it was a

00:01:27.20 completely different salad it was a great salad though and I still

00:01:31.00 I stand by I gave you what you wanted and it wasn't good and that's your fault

00:01:34.12 not mine what salad are you doing this week

00:01:36.14 I don't have a salad okay I'm not gonna I've already redeemed myself in that way

00:01:39.21 he's just gonna have to chug another soda at the end like we as we discussed

00:01:43.03 everything well Geoff I think maybe you should chug a soda for the first time

00:01:46.17 based on what people are saying nobody I think it's just [ __ ] easy to do

00:01:50.19 it's just hard to burp later I shouldn't Gavin a video doing it to prove that

00:01:54.01 it's not that hard this is not interesting the audience can

00:01:57.02 suck a butt because I definitely drank it we're not ahead anymore so that means

00:02:01.12 that at the time of this the audience has seen the previous

00:02:04.01 episode or listen yeah I'm all [ __ ] up it's

00:02:08.00 we caught up and now I'm terrified see this is why this is why we have a

00:02:11.10 a buffer so that way it just doesn't turn into more of this where Geoff is

00:02:16.02 confused and mad let Geoff be mad about your stuff also I

00:02:19.13 hate when we have a buffer because then I never know where the [ __ ] in the

00:02:23.05 timeline I am there's no way to win in recording this podcast I realized we

00:02:26.23 need to talk about this because the first of all why do we not have a buffer

00:02:30.03 how long has this episode been going by the way

00:02:32.11 uh well I don't know hey guess what Geoff didn't record

00:02:35.14 earlier he took a while to record I started it I'm sorry I started recording

00:02:40.06 at 257

00:02:41.23 wow okay I had to get up and get a soda that's fine that's

00:02:46.12 early thank you Gavin but why do we not have a buffer uh we don't have a buffer

00:02:51.20 because uh I don't know we don't have a buffer yes we do not have a buffer

00:02:56.18 because you pushed we weren't able to record

00:02:59.19 because you were busy doing something for a different podcast

00:03:04.05 well yes I was doing something for a different podcast

00:03:08.06 and but had I not been doing something for the podcast I also would have been

00:03:12.02 going to a funeral so okay uh it was a double Miami for me that week

00:03:16.09 yeah okay we'll really take the air out of my punch Geoff thank you for doing

00:03:19.19 that thank you for just really making me have to like pull back this

00:03:23.06 isn't about that the fact you were gone what I'm not even

00:03:27.09 gonna get into the semantics of it the point of this is

00:03:30.13 I think I think that we need to have a serious review over super fan jack

00:03:35.11 and his super fan status oh dude don't worry I'm right there with you

00:03:39.13 guess who's so tomorrow we're you know if we want to place where this exists on

00:03:43.07 the timeline we are recording this uh at three it's 303 p.m central time

00:03:48.15 uh June 24th uh 2021.

00:03:50.15 And tomorrow is the second face break [ __ ]

00:03:54.17 and uh jack has already backed out already backed out

00:03:59.14 but the jack's credit he backed out three days early

00:04:03.01 yeah that's true I will I remember all the credit in the world that he did not

00:04:08.06 do it day of uh yeah he so he didn't do it moment of

00:04:12.08 which is appreciative but I'm prepared I'm prepared to hear

00:04:16.03 any any talk regarding demotion of said super fandom I I ratched him back

00:04:20.16 back up as a show of good friends I think he's nervous

00:04:23.12 I think he doesn't want to I think he doesn't ever want to be in face

00:04:26.19 anything it's a lot of pressure we've talked about him so much as the super fan

00:04:30.22 he would have to deliver super fairness and maybe he's not capable

00:04:34.04 I don't see how we could continue to give him super fan status he's o for two

00:04:38.21 on these break [ __ ] streams we have moved our podcast we've not recorded our

00:04:42.21 podcast for his podcast I bought him a cameo

00:04:45.22 from his favorite his number one his favorite person I got him

00:04:50.17 we've done a lot for super fan jack I made him his own

00:04:54.01 t-shirt you made him a t-shirt I never made gathering a t-shirt

00:04:57.14 I don't think he could be super fan jack I think he's he's gotta we gotta he's

00:05:00.17 gotta go back to the miners I'm not saying he can't work his way

00:05:04.15 back up what's he doing now we could call him

00:05:08.06 we said uh minor league jack is what we'll call it

00:05:10.10 I like minor league jack uh I'm a fan of minor league jack should I call him

00:05:13.18 right now yeah yeah see if he can defend himself I

00:05:16.18 guess let me see if he'll answer uh let's see I mean a real super fan

00:05:21.01 would answer if you know his favorite podcast that's true

00:05:25.07 a minor league guy might not I hope this is a good idea

00:05:29.07 okay here we go hold on speaker can you guys hear that nope no much like

00:05:56.12 excited to be here I didn't hear anything I can't go into

00:06:35.02 I'm here I'm a big fan of the podcast yeah okay he's

00:06:37.22 [ __ ] blowing out my microphone all right Andrew wanted me to relay

00:06:44.06 you're you're well I gotta turn my game back down loud

00:06:47.07 uh hey what Andrew what did you want me to say to jack I just said that I think

00:06:50.11 he he can't be a super fan right now I think he's okay back to the miners jack

00:06:54.19 Andrew has uh he's pulled face rank as 33 percent of face

00:06:58.17 uh conversation he said uh he put his foot down and said that

00:07:03.12 you you've been stripped of your super fan title

00:07:07.11 uh and that you're now minor leagues fan jack you have to work your way back up

00:07:11.03 through the miners I I don't know if I believe a liar can hear him

00:07:16.09 okay well uh jack this has gone terribly wrong I'm gonna hang up on you now

00:07:20.17 and I will I relay that message thank you

00:07:23.07 I like we're talking about someone who we talk to on discord daily

00:07:27.07 and I can't just have him join the discord for five

00:07:31.22 why didn't why didn't you have him join the discord then if you've got all the

00:07:35.16 [ __ ] ideas what could I can I point out Geoff's

00:07:38.21 podcast Gavin did you hear that on my podcast Geoff said what happened to

00:07:43.12 the triangle and then I said you're 33 of the [ __ ]

00:07:46.23 thing no no you didn't I said I said Andrew is 33

00:07:50.15 of the podcast oh my god it is my podcast and it's your podcast

00:07:55.05 and it's gavin's podcast do you own a little piece of it it's a little piece

00:07:59.12 of yours so you can call it yours speaking of you know like hosting duties

00:08:03.08 welcome to face I don't know what episode this

00:08:06.23 is oh hello hello and welcome to episode 57 I believe of

00:08:09.21 faith my name is Geoff willing well now you're interrupting the intro

00:08:13.12 yeah it's too late the intro this is like 28 minutes in I'm willing to give

00:08:17.12 up one percent of uh the triangle I want to take 32 percent of the podcast

00:08:21.21 and split the remaining percent equally between

00:08:24.11 Eric and nick I think that's a great idea if I gave you my sauce Gavin could

00:08:28.23 I just buy your shares could I become the majority owner

00:08:33.11 uh yeah my percentage of face is totally for sale

00:08:36.17 um I'm willing to trade any amount of it to be honest I'll take the source

00:08:40.04 okay it's a lot hey sauce is valuable like more valuable than I anticipated

00:08:45.01 market value is that where the sauce is no longer

00:08:47.20 available can no longer get it and mcdonald's outside of Korea I think it's

00:08:53.01 those are standard sauces there have you made any sales

00:08:55.09 have not made any sales I'm in I made an alliance with nick

00:08:58.15 we've we've officially formed a sauce alliance and I've been uh I've been

00:09:02.21 searching I've been tapping into the market cabin

00:09:04.23 I I've been asking around I don't know if you saw this but I I reached out I

00:09:08.14 asked mcdonald's if they would be interested in buying the sauces

00:09:10.21 so immediately day one you're trying to sell it all back to the place that made

00:09:14.11 it yeah well I figured you know it was a big hit for them they could they could

00:09:18.21 use the sauce they could use some additional sauces I'm sure

00:09:21.20 a lot of people are saying they couldn't get them they're running low

00:09:25.12 I mean surely a different like surely burger king wants it more than

00:09:28.15 mcdonald's mcdonald's can just make more well that's that's what you're you know

00:09:30.21 well listen they they need to make it though they need to ship it they need to

00:09:35.11 distribute it I'm ready to go I got my sauce tower set I'm ready

00:09:40.01 that was my idea I also I just didn't know I was curious how they'd reply I

00:09:44.08 just wanted to see what mcdonald's would do

00:09:46.06 and what did they say so I tweeted hi mcdonald's then I included mcdonald's

00:09:50.01 Canada you gotta cover all your bases now that the bts meal is gone I hear you

00:09:54.21 could use some sauce I'm an honorable man simply looking to

00:09:57.17 unload an empire in exchange for my liquid gold

00:10:00.12 how about free nuggets for the rest of the year I eagerly await your response

00:10:05.16 hashtag the sauce boss which I didn't know I guess is the

00:10:08.13 nickname of the epic mealtime guy that's holly yeah yeah I didn't know

00:10:13.20 that uh he liked the tweet relating to somebody calling him awesome

00:10:18.13 in exchange for that so then uh mcdonald's america quiet mcdonald's Canada

00:10:24.07 wild response quick mask wow 81 sauces with ice is that right have you verified

00:10:29.01 it's uh yeah it's I can verify it's more than 81 I don't

00:10:32.12 know where anyone came from well I assume they counted the uh the

00:10:36.06 length the width and the height it's basic volume I it's way more than

00:10:40.10 that we got a 405 sauce thing I was kind of disappointed

00:10:44.06 be honest then they did another tweet that like they acknowledged it was 405.

00:10:48.15 Oh they just it's just terrible maths yeah they did they did a second one

00:10:52.09 where they're like four or five they're just wildly wrong

00:10:55.04 they did say quick math that's true correct math

00:10:58.08 and it's also they're they're not a math company they they make nuggets and

00:11:02.02 burgers okay I don't expect a lot from you no but no response

00:11:07.02 so then I I followed up I I extended my offer I gave an even bigger offer for my

00:11:12.00 second go-around did a second tweet the following day informing

00:11:16.23 mcdonald's that our exclusive negotiating window is now closed

00:11:21.05 I respect you so uh I can't even read this

00:11:24.04 uh I respect you so the opportunity so the offer stands but

00:11:27.09 big sauce doesn't wait the sauce game is ongoing you cannot pause for the sauce

00:11:31.01 game I now kindly extend my bts sauce empire

00:11:34.10 for free nuggets offer to wendy's and burger king

00:11:38.18 I'm sleeping on this channel hashtag clear eyes full sauce can't lose

00:11:43.14 I have stacked my nugget containers and uh one of the drinks

00:11:47.15 drink things I got I actually I forgot so they didn't reply to this so I don't

00:11:52.00 know if they're you know they're probably having business meetings

00:11:55.18 they're probably trying to work out a counteroffer I assume

00:11:59.20 I've yet to hear back from wendy's burger king

00:12:02.10 or uh mcdonald's america but I forgot to

00:12:05.11 mention this and just talking about this brings us up

00:12:08.04 the first day the sauce ended the bts sauce expired the deal

00:12:12.15 or not the deal but their offering of it the 21st I woke up

00:12:17.09 I went downstairs I walked outside I had a bag of mcdonald's

00:12:20.06 at my front door just really just a bag yeah so I was like what is this I didn't

00:12:25.12 order this so I pulled it in I looked at it it came

00:12:28.20 from the night before it was placed at 1036 pm or that's when the receipt was

00:12:32.15 printed it was delivered to my front door using a one of the

00:12:36.17 delivery apps but not one I use a different delivery app delivered it to

00:12:41.12 my door which then so there's two scenarios in my mind

00:12:46.13 either the mcdonald's hates me for all the sauce orders and as a a

00:12:51.09 source of revenge they waited until the evening of the final day that the sauce

00:12:56.08 was available and sent me like either [ __ ] with like

00:12:59.20 it was the order was a medium fries a large fries

00:13:03.14 a bit quarter pounder and that was oh and a soda a medium soda

00:13:08.08 so either I feel like they sent it to me and they [ __ ] with me

00:13:10.10 like they did something to the soda and just thinking like oh they'll think free

00:13:14.02 food and they'll have it or I have had so

00:13:17.09 many mcdonald's orders recently that the driver just assumed

00:13:22.04 I was the person who placed it they just delivered it there

00:13:26.01 but it's a different app but I had rogue mcdonald's showed

00:13:30.10 I felt like it was like a warning like it was a it was a threat or

00:13:33.16 like a declaration of war I did not see that when I said those tweets up

00:13:37.19 interesting interesting that you that's how you view it and not as

00:13:41.13 a peace offering from mcdonald's to you here are some other

00:13:45.02 fine products we offer that you might enjoy

00:13:48.06 I feel like a peace offering would be more sauce or

00:13:51.01 I was going to say I think that would be

00:13:53.16 the true peace offering I don't think uh

00:13:56.19 burgers that looked gross and two orders [ __ ] now you're insulting them and

00:14:00.04 they're all it was the gross Andrew I think you're slightly overwhelmed

00:14:03.01 I think you're in all kinds of directions at once I don't think you

00:14:06.12 truly know what you want to do with a source

00:14:09.07 um I agree well it's yeah no I I don't it's worth a lot though like it's uh I

00:14:14.17 sent you the listing of like a hundred dollars

00:14:18.10 for one sauce of each and like the container in a bag

00:14:21.14 so what was that was that the packaging or was that the actual sauce that was

00:14:24.17 everything it was I think two sauce containers and it was the nugget box

00:14:29.12 the listing I shared that was like a hundred dollars have you have you been

00:14:34.23 drinking heavily recently or taking any kind of

00:14:37.01 medication or drugs are you on any drug like heroin or any kind of mind-altering

00:14:41.16 drugs right now I'm straight edge Geoff there's no way you could have gotten

00:14:46.00 hammered or like I don't know did some black car heroin

00:14:48.23 and ordered it yourself no because it's not even an app I use it was a

00:14:53.14 different delivery system than I would ever

00:14:56.03 use they don't even have my address for the other so

00:14:59.06 I think I honestly think what most likely happened is they saw mcdonald's

00:15:03.09 order this building and just took it to my door but my door

00:15:07.14 is so hard to find like it's impressive that it reached me

00:15:11.11 out of all the places I love that you you describe your door

00:15:14.07 like it's like it's magic and it exists in the harry potter universe and you

00:15:17.16 have to walk by a certain time of day or do an incantation to discover it

00:15:22.19 he has the sewing machine towards the wall the right angle right yeah

00:15:27.04 we've talked about doing a bathtub race thing at some point Geoff

00:15:30.16 if you are ever where I live I will not give you instructions I'll just tell you

00:15:34.08 the address of my building and we'll see how long it takes you to

00:15:38.15 find my it is okay Gavin you're you're involved with that

00:15:41.13 too buddy challenge and accepted all right that sounds awesome and I got

00:15:45.07 news for you I got there we're definitely going to do the bathtub

00:15:48.19 race but there's another reason we might end up in

00:15:51.02 in Canada for face down the road and so there's two possibilities in the next

00:15:56.01 year that I that could bring us to your wonderful fine island I I didn't to the

00:16:00.23 island specifically not even just generally well to the

00:16:04.01 country but if I'm gonna go to the country I'm gonna make

00:16:06.20 the additional effort to go to your home turf this is exciting I don't I haven't

00:16:10.18 heard what the other possible is it too far out to talk about

00:16:13.19 I'm guessing oh I just I I just it would be more fun for me not to tell you

00:16:17.20 okay well wait so I just you're gonna show up one day is that no I'll tell you

00:16:22.01 in in good time okay I just don't see the point in in telling you now it'll be

00:16:27.18 like next year sometime maybe a year from now you're you're in two months

00:16:31.13 or so okay potentially okay that's concerning

00:16:34.12 and then I'm gonna find your door I don't think you will I think you're

00:16:38.15 gonna end up having to text me to try to figure out

00:16:40.20 like instructions I'd be impressed if you found it

00:16:44.05 I would I don't know what there should we should make a bet of some kind I bet

00:16:47.16 you could not from the front of my building

00:16:50.02 you could not find my door within two minutes here's how I would do it within

00:16:53.16 two minutes here's how to do it I would order mcdonald's to your house

00:16:58.07 and then I would start the timer I would start the two minute timer as soon as

00:17:01.17 the guy showed up and I just follow him he knows how to get there we've

00:17:04.06 established that he knows how to get there with your orders with other

00:17:07.16 people's orders he's the key to me finding your place instantly I have no fit

00:17:12.11 cost me 99 cents in a a delivery fee I'll order some small fries and he'll

00:17:16.18 take me right there to maps Google maps or anything does it just put

00:17:19.23 it in the wrong place on the map put it in the wrong place yeah

00:17:22.21 puts in the wrong place how do the drivers find it then it's

00:17:26.06 uh well on one of the apps I can manually and they've changed this so

00:17:29.16 it's I don't think I'll be making many food orders anymore you could manually

00:17:32.23 place where you want them to drive and I'd kind of put them in the middle

00:17:36.15 of nowhere essentially but even still like people would get

00:21:08.03 uh yeah like airport gates you know like when you're transferring

00:21:11.10 I think it's the worst combination it's it's so bad when

00:21:14.22 everyone like someone's counting on you or you're gonna miss something

00:21:18.20 but you don't know where to look for the thing you're looking for

00:21:22.07 you kind of end up like frantically jolting around in all directions like

00:21:26.06 looking at [ __ ]

00:21:26.06 and you want to be moving fast but you don't have a direction so you're just

00:21:30.02 like stuttering around yeah it's a frantic

00:21:33.07 mess I'm trying to think at other times I think airports are really like the one

00:21:37.05 time where it's like I don't know where this gate is I have 10 minutes

00:21:40.16 what am I gonna do I was once in Spain we're filming

00:21:44.04 some formula one or something and uh I realized that the the guy was with

00:21:48.20 didn't bring the mags for the camera they were still in his hotel room

00:21:53.02 so I had to be I like I was like I'll go back and get him

00:21:56.03 and uh one of the runners like drove me back to the little resort where we were

00:21:59.20 staying and we'd already had we had a shot in

00:22:03.02 the camera we just couldn't save it so that everything was waiting on us

00:22:07.04 to download this shot and I was ran back into this resort it was like

00:22:11.00 a little compound of maybe like 50

00:22:13.12 villas but I got lost I could I'd only seen it in the dark

00:22:17.20 and I it was like confusing me it was confusing me during the day

00:22:21.06 so I was like uh-oh where's the and I couldn't find the number and I was just

00:22:24.08 running around I must have spent five minutes running full speed but not

00:22:28.23 knowing where I was running I must have like a completely insane person like a

00:22:33.17 chicken with his head cut off and I was freaking out I thought I was gonna black

00:22:37.02 out by the end of it I was like everyone's waiting and eventually I

00:22:41.14 found it and it was like really close to the entrance

00:22:45.03 that's I I keep getting so like this is a weird like it wasn't super frantic

00:22:50.21 I got lost in Austin one time I don't think I've told the story on the podcast

00:22:55.03 this is post ankle roll uh this is I this is pre-anchor roll okay it was fine

00:23:00.12 at this point I have two distinctive lost and Austin

00:23:04.10 stories it always seems to happen at around rtx I guess the main reason why

00:23:08.13 I'm in Austin but it was the night I am like one of

00:23:11.23 the 12 people that didn't mind true detective season two

00:23:16.00 and it was the finale was on like the closing night of rtx

00:23:20.11 and Caleb invited me to this bar thing where I guess that like every year

00:23:23.18 they'd like a bunch of people would get together in the community do like a

00:23:26.19 community event at this place and it was like maybe two blocks away

00:23:31.16 from where I was staying the hotel I was at

00:23:33.18 and this guy that I I met through the community really wanted to play rock

00:23:38.23 paper scissors against me for whatever reason

00:23:41.00 and uh I was like meet me I'll meet you outside of this hotel

00:23:44.18 we can play rock paper scissors and we can walk and talk to this bar that I

00:23:48.08 have to go to so that's what we did I won by the way

00:23:51.10 do you play paper scissors a lot with a lot of people I don't play rock

00:23:54.22 no it was their thing they really wanted to play rock paper scissors I was like

00:23:58.13 sure I'll play I just love the idea of you and someone else in an alley the

00:24:02.01 police roll up it's like all right where's the drugs and it's like no sir

00:24:05.15 we were just playing rock paper scissors don't worry about it that's normal I'm

00:24:10.14 very competitive so I I luckily I won I think it was close I

00:24:13.20 think he won the first one I won the next three I don't remember exactly but

00:24:17.07 then we walked and talked to the place and I stayed I just hung out I didn't

00:24:21.05 really do anything I played pinball mainly for like two or three hours at this

00:24:25.06 party do you think you're good at rock paper scissors like better than the

00:24:28.15 average person I don't think so I think I'm actually especially bad at

00:24:32.09 rock paper scissors I'd say I'm a bad rock paper scissors player

00:24:34.10 fair enough which pinball will you play I don't remember it was just like a

00:24:38.00 whatever it was like me being bad at a party not

00:24:41.01 really knowing anybody and being awkward so I'm just gonna play pinball in the

00:24:44.02 corner if it makes you feel any better that bar

00:24:47.00 that you went to that they would go to every year I'm pretty sure

00:24:50.06 yes it's closed it is gone it doesn't work out I don't know why that would

00:24:53.11 make me feel any better at all I mean it's not the bar's fault I just

00:24:56.19 isn't it isn't it the bar's fault Andrew no it was a great bar

00:25:00.04 don't they promise a good time did you have a good time it sounded horrible

00:25:03.16 I think a good time was there it just I couldn't find it that's my fault

00:25:08.00 but I think it existed within the premises I just was too awkward to like

00:25:11.11 you you had all the ingredients you just couldn't make it into a good just

00:25:14.17 couldn't bake the cake honestly okay so the first part there

00:25:17.07 was like a ufc event on and they had a giant tv so I watched out on a couch I

00:25:20.22 was like this is pretty good and then I played pinball

00:25:24.10 so like as far as my evening goes not bad but terrible party

00:25:27.07 as far as my involvement in it so then I leave

00:25:30.05 and I left because I wanted to catch the finale of true detective season two and

00:25:35.01 I gave myself like 30 minutes to go and I just kept walking and I

00:25:38.13 couldn't quite remember my turn because I spent the entire time talking to the

00:25:41.19 guy so I wasn't really mindful of all I had to do was literally I took one

00:25:45.09 turn and then walked straight so I just had to turn once and I was set

00:25:50.04 or you could have opened a map on your phone could have done that

00:25:54.08 I didn't have my phone my phone died at the party that's what

00:25:57.06 happened both times I've been lost my phone died at the party so I didn't have

00:26:00.11 access to my phone or else I would have used my phone

00:26:03.09 that would have solved this immediately so I had no phone and I just am going

00:26:06.17 straight and I'm like eventually I'll find a turn I just every street I'd pass

00:26:10.13 I'd be like I don't think that was it and I just keep walking and I realized I

00:26:14.05 had missed my turn when I ran out of buildings there was no

00:26:17.22 longer any buildings ahead of me I was like leaving the city

00:26:20.19 essentially at that point it is getting it's like 11

00:26:24.12 p.m maybe a little bit earlier it's like 103011

00:26:28.05 and everything's like in the area wasn't really open

00:26:31.14 and I'm sweating because it's hot and it's the summer

00:26:34.23 and I'm just going up to people asking like hey I'm trying to stay I stayed

00:26:38.23 here could you tell me where it is I have no

00:26:41.15 idea where I'm going and they'd kind of point

00:26:45.11 sometimes or they just ignore me it was a disaster

00:26:47.22 I spent like 30 minutes lost walking through the

00:26:51.02 the city at night trying to find my hotel which I know is close

00:26:55.09 like it's within probably 10 minutes of wherever I'm at I am

00:26:59.09 I've got some in the central area I came across two

00:27:02.20 extremely drunk ladies who were thrilled by the fact that I was from Canada and

00:27:06.21 they were kind enough to use their phone to help me

00:27:09.08 but they were too drunk to be useful in any way so they also just gave me kind

00:27:13.18 of shitty directions I spent like an hour lost by the end of it just walking

00:27:18.06 up and down streets going around trying to ask people nobody would help me

00:27:21.21 eventually I came across one of those bike carts

00:27:25.12 that are intended for like multiple people and I'm like I'll

00:27:28.08 pay you whatever just this is my hotel I'm so lost please take me to this place

00:27:32.18 like a little pedicab yeah like a little pedicab and I hopped in

00:27:37.03 I just had a great conversation he was playing like def leppard

00:27:40.06 extremely loudly it was like 11 p.m he his last job was a gravedigger in new

00:27:45.03 Orleans so I just asked him about that it was just like the most bizarre

00:27:49.08 evening like the conclusion to it I finish I get back to the hotel I'm way

00:27:54.17 late for watching the true detective finale

00:27:56.23 I turn it on and I mean spoilers for true detective season two

00:28:01.00 there's a character in it who dies by having an extended walk through the

00:28:04.14 desert and that's the exact thing I walked into

00:28:07.09 it was just this character walking trying to make it back to the city

00:28:11.07 it's exactly it was like Gavin in this fly thing it perfectly lined up

00:28:15.04 but yeah I got it was just a disaster every time both times I've been lost in

00:28:18.10 Austin it's because my phone died and I've

00:28:20.17 gotten shitty directions and Caleb was the source of both of them now I think

00:28:23.16 about it I just like that you always go to these other cities

00:28:26.17 miles for not even in your own country and you refuse to charge your phone

00:28:30.04 every night yeah it was charged it's just I was there for a few hours

00:28:35.02 it died I don't know I've always had shitty phones outside of

00:28:39.02 my most recent too it's it's impressive as well

00:28:41.19 in that uh sorry I guess not the case anymore because of the explosive

00:28:45.11 growth of the last two or three years but this is at a time when Austin

00:28:49.06 didn't have that many big buildings yeah because that's why I knew I was that

00:28:52.12 much of a city so it's like process of elimination you probably

00:28:55.13 could have walked to every big building in 30 minutes in Austin

00:28:58.17 that's how I realized I went too far is the big building stopped existing it was

00:29:03.01 just all flat that was my sign that I'm out of the

00:29:05.19 stadium really small in the back yeah yeah everything got really tiny I'm

00:29:09.18 imagining you walking out of the side of Austin into the desert

00:29:13.12 you're probably just like two blocks away that was the the first time the

00:29:17.16 second time it was the day after it was when that

00:29:20.13 guy drove me from san Antonio to Austin the next day I was like I want a burger

00:29:25.07 I went to a burger place that was close and it happened to be a place that you

00:29:29.20 took me to Geoff the first time I went to Austin you and Caleb it was this tiny

00:29:33.16 bar burger place casino el camino no it wasn't that one it was a different one

00:29:36.15 what was my invite by the way to that I I don't know do you remember what it was

00:29:40.13 called I've no memory what it was called I also

00:29:43.02 think that that business no longer exists uh probably it was a small but I was

00:29:47.05 like oh I've been here I didn't realize this was the place I'd been before

00:29:50.04 that's cool had a burger had a great time next day Caleb and I went for lunch

00:29:55.11 during rtx and during the lunch my phone died and

00:29:58.16 so we ate lunch and I said Caleb my phone is dead

00:30:02.05 all I like I know I don't know where my place is

00:30:05.22 but I know how to get from that bar burger place

00:30:09.08 to my place so if you could tell me where that burger bar place is it's not

00:30:13.11 far away just tell me where it is and he once

00:30:16.03 again his instructions where he pointed he's like that way so then I just

00:30:20.00 started walking in that direction found somebody else at the convention

00:30:23.07 center who walked with me for a bit and were talking and he offered me his

00:30:27.12 resume I said I can't really help you get a job and then he's like cool I

00:30:32.06 gotta go so that he abandoned me I remembered I crossed train tracks

00:30:37.04 going from point a to point b so I just stood on the train tracks and I just

00:30:40.13 kept walking down them because I was like eventually once again

00:30:44.06 I'll find my turn in the heat I'm miserable once again just drenched in sweat

00:30:49.10 walking down the train tracks I was probably like 15 minutes away from having a

00:30:55.07 breakdown of like I'm so lost uh but then I looked up and I was

00:30:58.20 right in front of my building I don't know how I got there

00:31:01.06 but I just made it back and I was like oh that's super convenient

00:31:04.16 and I was good do you think maybe it's not hard to find your front door at all

00:31:08.16 it's just hard for you to find your front door

00:31:11.06 no I mean I was just based off of just based off every story you've ever told

00:31:15.07 about you getting from point a to point b

00:31:17.01 no it's just if I was guided to the bar I knew where to go because it was a

00:31:20.02 straight shot and I still found it but it was I I relied on the

00:31:23.15 train tracks I was just walking down the tracks

00:31:26.12 it's terrible I'm good at getting lost apparently I am not convinced your place

00:31:31.05 is hard to find I'm sorry no it is I will this is what we'll do

00:31:35.07 it's definitely hard for you to find but I think most things are

00:31:39.18 what if we you know those like tablet that are on wheels like it's a moped

00:31:43.08 slash tablet and you see through it what are the range on those if I set one up

00:31:47.12 in front of my building I bet you couldn't find my door

00:31:50.08 within the two minutes I would love to do this we have to figure out a way to

00:31:54.03 do like long-range camera feed I don't know if that technology even exists

00:31:58.02 it does want to use it it does yeah we could do that yeah we can do that

00:32:01.19 we can find a way I like you always have weird interactions with people by the

00:32:05.10 sounds of it yeah oh the weirdest the weirdest interaction you didn't ever

00:32:09.11 tell us about the the orgy invite or anything I I I've had

00:32:13.05 weird interactions in Austin too I feel like

00:32:15.17 some of them you know it you can you can put out a vibe whether or not you want

00:32:18.21 to be spoken to by strangers but I feel like when I first moved here

00:32:21.22 I was all for it you know I was in a new country if people came up and

00:32:25.01 spoke to me I'd be like oh hey what's up and once I was it was when we lived in

00:32:28.02 that rental house Geoff I think I'd walk to a like fresh place

00:32:31.21 or something and I was walking back and some girl stopped me and she was

00:32:36.08 like hey can I talk to you about planned parenthood and I was like uh

00:32:40.16 yeah what's that and she was like all right douche bag and just turned her back

00:32:44.17 on me and walked off because I didn't know what it was and

00:32:48.13 she thought I was taking the piss I assume everyone here knows what it is

00:32:52.10 they just wanted to tell people about it

00:32:54.21 and I was like what's planned parenthood and she

00:32:57.12 she was somebody none of it and I just walked home just like what did I do

00:33:01.17 she wanted to you decide to sit your signature on something or to donate

00:33:06.02 money probably to planned parenthood and she probably thought you were put on

00:33:09.15 a fake accent or just being dismissive

00:33:11.13 because those poor those people get [ __ ]

00:33:14.02 on all day long by strangers that's really funny

00:33:17.05 yeah she was really mean I was just being friendly

00:33:20.07 that probably oh man probably ruined the next hour

00:33:23.11 it probably ruined her next hour too she's like she went home and she's like

00:33:26.22 I swear to god all I'm trying to do is raise money for planned parenthood and

00:33:30.10 every [ __ ] dude I talk to is a [ __ ] to me

00:33:33.17 this guy earlier today he pretended not to know what it is

00:33:38.14 and he used a bad bad British accent.

00:33:42.00 I don't think I even fully told the homeless orgy

00:33:45.09 story thing so that happened because I was with somebody who didn't know how to

00:33:50.00 use uber and they put the pickup point like six

00:33:53.16 blocks away in the middle of an orgy there was a they pinned

00:33:56.12 it no we're outside rtx this is there was I never made it to the homeless orchy

00:34:01.01 Gavin I was just it was an invite that was presented to me

00:34:04.04 okay we're outside the convention center we're trying to get back to our place

00:34:08.12 this is not only just pre ankle roll this is pre me having the flu and getting

00:34:13.12 everybody that I was with sick um we are he's like I'll call an uber oh

00:34:18.12 it's weird it keeps telling me we have to go

00:34:21.08 go do it and it's like seven blocks away and so we're just walking walking this

00:34:25.01 homeless guy walks up and it's like hey can I have

00:34:27.11 money and I was like sure I gave him some money

00:34:30.07 and then we became best friends and he was following me and we're talking the

00:34:33.14 whole way and we I had a Seattle seahawks shirt on

00:34:37.10 and he was talking to me about football and he's like you think the Seattle

00:34:40.13 seahawks are gonna win this year I didn't really think so I was like yeah maybe

00:34:44.19 and then he's like nah you think the Seattle seahawks are gonna win the super

00:34:48.23 bowl this year and I was like yeah he's like you think

00:34:52.02 the Seattle seahawks are gonna win the super bowl this year and I'm like yeah

00:34:55.14 they're gonna win because it's like I'm a [ __ ] budget

00:34:58.10 Jerry Maguire like he wanted me to yell about it and I was just playing into his

00:35:01.14 thing and so I was like yeah they're going to

00:35:04.06 win he's like I don't I don't like their chances this year

00:35:06.20 why did we do that what was the point was like why

00:35:09.23 I think the point was to keep you engaged long enough to get you

00:35:13.08 behind an alley somewhere where he could stab you and have a brand new Seattle

00:35:17.07 seahawks jersey to walk around I'll play rock paper scissors

00:35:20.03 yeah so then we kept walking and he was talk like he just kept talking to me

00:35:24.21 and we're crossing a section and I think somebody realized that like it was sort

00:35:28.12 of a weird conversation we're having and they shoulder checked him in the

00:35:32.01 crosswalk and that stopped him for a minute and he turned he's like what the

00:35:35.11 [ __ ] to the guy and I think the point was to try to

00:35:38.00 allow me to get distance but as soon as we crossed the street my friend was like

00:35:41.20 oh this is where we gotta be for the car so I'm just standing there

00:35:47.01 and the homeless guy comes back and this is where it elevated to another level

00:35:51.12 he he looked at me and it was like I would describe the vibe as like Anton

00:35:56.15 sugar in the gas station of no country for old men there's like

00:36:00.07 this weird tension and he was just staring at me and he's

00:36:04.08 like you have the prettiest eyes I've ever seen

00:36:07.02 I was like we are we are going somewhere

00:36:10.06 what color are your eyes uh I'd say like a blue like a darkish blue but he said

00:36:15.18 yes exactly according to him and then it turned into

00:36:19.22 uh why are you here uh and I was like oh I'm at whenever I try to like describe

00:36:25.03 rtx to somebody that would have no concept of what it is I always just say

00:36:29.21 it's like a video game convention and uh he's like oh so you're telling me

00:36:34.23 you run all this [ __ ]

00:36:37.07 and he met the city of Austin and I was like no

00:36:40.11 I just you know I just you know I like games and stuff so I'm here for that and

00:36:44.13 he's like oh so you're a hacker and [ __ ]

00:36:48.00 and then he started going and I was like no I just I like video

00:36:51.12 games and then he was trying to convince me to go on his workout plan he's like

00:36:56.08 you and I could work out we have a great time we'll work out we'll we'll have

00:37:01.18 so much fun then it pivoted to that he knew a guy who had a bunch of drugs

00:37:06.00 and then it pivoted to where you staying at I can bring the party

00:37:10.08 and it was like a very clear like implication of or I don't remember the

00:37:13.10 wording but it was like we're gonna have an orgy how was it how

00:37:17.07 was what the orgy yeah not enough condoms but can you

00:37:21.08 imagine the podcast you two could have started together if you'd

00:37:24.14 if you'd just told him where he stayed well

00:37:27.22 he doesn't know where he said he could never find the damn place that's true

00:37:32.09 andrew's like I'll give you my address in Vancouver island but you're never

00:37:36.02 gonna find it the dude's walking around with him in

00:37:38.12 Austin he's like we're going in circles man where are you staying I don't know

00:37:44.19 the entire time I don't think I blinked like we're having a weird stare dad for

00:37:49.07 this whole conversation and he's like where are you staying and

00:37:53.18 I panicked and I lied I just said I'm uh the Hilton

00:37:57.07 26th floor I just came up with a floor and he's like cool

00:38:00.23 they walked away I never saw him again we got in our car

00:38:03.22 do you think somebody who maybe looked reasonably like you or even not

00:38:08.14 that like you on the sixth floor of the Hilton

00:38:11.02 just had a surprise orgy happen in their laps I'm curious what happened that

00:38:15.05 evening on the 26th floor I'd love to know I hope not the 26th

00:38:19.18 floor but it sounds like a lot of fun might have happened

00:38:22.17 we get in the car I feel so sick and I don't know that I

00:38:25.23 I have a flu at this point dealing with fever flu I had everything I'm super

00:38:29.11 sick get home I immediately vomit and it was

00:38:32.21 the day that I tried big red for the first time so just bright red

00:38:37.10 vomit everywhere and I got everybody sick but I just yeah I've had some I don't

00:38:42.02 know what it is about me but I draw weird interaction with people

00:38:45.12 like I have a magnet to it it could be fun or it could be you're invited to a

00:38:49.07 homeless orchid which also could be fun yeah it's it could be

00:38:53.15 can't complain about that necessarily I I don't know that I'd want to be the

00:38:56.19 kind of guy who goes an entire life without ever getting invited to a

00:39:00.15 homeless orgy you know is that a life worth living that's a yes that's a

00:39:05.09 great point how many homeless orgies have you been invited to Gavin

00:39:10.12 no not any not yet what a sad sad life for a sad little man

00:39:14.14 I didn't know that you filmed f1 stuff Gavin dude he filmed Fernando Alonso he

00:39:19.12 did that's what I was doing Alonzo was waiting I had no idea

00:39:23.20 I don't think it was for actually for it

00:39:26.13 wasn't a real formula one race it was uh

00:39:28.13 I would say it was like a commercial for santander or something who maybe

00:39:32.13 sponsored some [ __ ] I don't know who knows I I

00:39:35.14 don't I don't really know all about all the stuff I worked on sometimes you just

00:39:39.03 show up and shoot and then you never see it it probably didn't even

00:39:42.22 air in the uk or something or anything do you remember what the commercial was

00:39:47.03 I don't know I can show you no I'd love to see the

00:39:50.12 footage you still have the footage yeah I got most of the stuff I shot oh

00:39:54.13 that's really cool it is it is pretty cool it makes me

00:39:57.10 respect him a little bit more when I find out he's worked on stuff that I now

00:40:01.03 like like f1

00:40:02.07 yeah why do you like f1 so much now have you ever watched it

00:40:05.22 yeah it's [ __ ] awesome it's hard point to argue against I mean

00:40:10.02 I I feel like that's the answer yeah it's cool I mean like technically it's

00:40:14.19 it's very cool it's not I find it not very fun to watch in person though

00:40:19.10 oh rocino racing person you really don't get a sense of

00:40:22.16 like where the race is you just if you're on a corner you just kind of see

00:40:25.22 cars pass by and you don't it really is much better televised I

00:40:29.15 think I feel like most sporting events are better televised

00:40:33.14 for a football match that's nice in person you get the vibe

00:40:37.18 you get the cheering you get people standing up in front of you and not

00:40:41.12 sitting down for half an hour that was [ __ ] annoying oh my god dude

00:40:46.15 I was it's funny because I made a joke uh so Gavin and I went to a

00:40:50.20 for uh what was that last Saturday I guess we

00:40:54.12 yeah well first off we hung out in person and nothing blew up

00:40:59.01 everything held there was no extra weirdness aside from I got some cucumbers

00:41:02.22 uh given to me all right well that was [ __ ] weird

00:41:06.12 that that in itself was a whole there was a whole thing

00:41:09.12 Andrew there's a whole thing did you hear about that cucumbers no I have no

00:41:12.23 idea about the cucumbers well we should get into it because it was

00:41:16.23 fascinating to me uh however yeah we we spent an entire time hanging out

00:41:21.21 and uh I I'd say was a pretty pretty like medium decent time uh I was telling

00:41:27.03 Andrew I don't know what we would like I don't

00:41:30.02 even nothing funny happened nothing gross happened

00:41:34.04 nothing weird happened it was just a medium time

00:41:36.06 we did I mean it was nice it was a good time I had a lovely time it was me and

00:41:40.04 you and Emily and Millicent and we went to uh to see the

00:41:43.21 the first home game of the Austin fc soccer

00:41:46.19 mls soccer team nothing of like face note

00:41:49.13 happened which yeah means it was a good time yeah I mean I will say

00:41:53.12 uh we had to we had to endure Matthew McConaughey

00:41:56.19 looking like a goddamn leprechaun that was I loved that bit

00:42:00.02 uh he Andrew he came out because he's a part owner of the team and yes he has to

00:42:04.15 you know McConaughey bless all of every cool thing in Austin you know uh

00:42:09.16 well first off he did like a like a scat type rap thing

00:42:13.21 that he does you know or he just [ __ ]

00:42:15.16 what just freestyle some [ __ ] that sounds like some [ __ ]

00:42:20.00 But means nothing you know he did that for a little bit about Austin and

00:42:24.05 competition and [ __ ] soccer I was looking at him down there on the pitch

00:42:27.11 while he was dressed in green and slamming on his

00:42:31.05 drum and I just thought that guy was an interstellar

00:42:35.11 yeah dude then he gavin's not kidding he walked out on the pitch

00:42:39.01 in a bright green suit like a full suit which by the way brave to do because you

00:42:44.05 could green screen anything on that dude like you won a golf tournament

00:42:49.12 yeah and then yeah yeah like you won a golf tournament yeah like

00:42:53.19 yeah and uh and then he played the bongos okay like seriously

00:43:04.23 and then we got to watch the soccer game it was great

00:43:08.17 did they win uh they tied the first game of the entire stadium like but for real

00:43:14.23 and it was a nil nil yeah it was a it was a pretty typical soccer game it was

00:43:20.08 a 0-0

00:43:21.20 yeah wow I was sat next to Millie the game ended and she was like all

00:43:26.12 right so what we're going to overtime or what I was like

00:43:30.06 nah that was it we go out she was like wait that happens

00:43:32.17 I was like oh yeah that happens all the time

00:43:35.08 it makes it really exciting when there's a goal there you have McConaughey on

00:43:39.02 wardrobes and nobody scores yeah it's exciting evening we had that

00:43:42.20 mojo working for us and we still didn't score

00:43:45.03 I got to say though gorgeous stadium awesome that Austin finally has a pro team

00:43:48.19 really cool experience getting to go to the first game and it was awesome that

00:43:52.04 Emily was able to put all that together for us

00:43:55.01 and I had a wonderful time and I'm really glad

00:43:57.10 that uh none of us broke anything and there was

00:44:00.11 there was no tornado or any kind of weather event it was uh

00:44:04.08 it gave me hope that maybe we could do it again someday I

00:44:07.00 I mean this all sounds fantastic I feel like I missed what happened with the

00:44:10.04 cucumber where's the cucumber coming into play did I miss that

00:44:13.07 okay so I pick Gavin shows up in my house and as we're driving he goes

00:44:17.08 uh had a weird thing happen today and I go what's that and he goes uh

00:44:22.04 somebody chucked a load of pickles on my front door

00:44:24.15 in a in a bag full of brine like pickled brine

00:44:27.07 and I was like you mean like a jar of lastic pickles full pickles

00:44:31.01 dumped into a freezer bag ziploc shut like full of brine and pickles and he

00:44:34.21 was like yeah just on my front porch and then

00:44:37.22 I was like well you have cameras so let's look at the cameras

00:44:41.22 he pulls up there's no the pickles just show up on his front door camera

00:44:46.15 it's like it's like they just get delivered by a hand that didn't have a body

00:44:50.20 yeah just see them like slide into frame and there's no one there

00:44:54.12 so we talk about this all night while we're at the we're having

00:44:58.03 soccer fun right and uh oh and by the way gav there was one thing going on

00:45:01.21 that I never told you about that was distracting me all night that I'll

00:45:03.20 I'll bring up so the whole ride back to gavin's house we're gonna give him a

00:45:07.04 ride home we're like do you think the pickles will

00:45:10.06 be on the porch should we check we get there we run up

00:45:14.08 and uh there were three giant dry ass cucumbers in a ziploc bag that

00:45:18.06 obviously came from somebody's garden there was no they weren't pickles

00:45:21.12 I don't know how Gavin got they were pickles there was no pickled brine

00:45:26.04 there was no brine of anything it was just three

00:45:28.12 cucumbers in a bag in my defense the bag was full of condensation and I think I

00:45:33.03 mistook it for it all I did okay all I did really there

00:45:36.19 was a you know there was an uber waiting I just

00:45:39.20 walked out my front door I thought that looks like a bag of pickles and I

00:45:42.21 stepped over them and then I just continued what I didn't touch him I

00:45:44.08 didn't really look

00:45:47.18 surely there's emily's like surely there

00:45:50.02 was a note or something and he's like no no nothing

00:45:52.21 I walk up I look at the cucumbers I immediately identify they are not pickles

00:45:57.05 look to the right see the note pick it up it's like hey here's some cucumbers

00:46:00.18 from the garden if you don't need them pass them on to the next neighbor thanks

00:46:05.20 it was all confusing a glance everything made sense now that I had time to

00:46:10.16 investigate also when Gavin found the other footage

00:46:14.17 it got interesting I will say that he found footage from another camera that

00:46:19.14 was fascinating it was delivered I guess by an elderly woman who

00:46:24.20 mission impossible kind of looks like kind of looked like

00:46:28.22 uh a witch out of left foot dead and she yeah she was like hobbling around

00:46:33.18 and she like grabs the pole near that the front of the house

00:46:37.18 and kind of swings her arm around it just like slides it onto the

00:46:42.00 onto the bit that the camera can see she like deliberately avoided going up the

00:46:46.21 steps she just reached around the railings

00:46:48.19 and put it there so it looked like from the doorbell that no one delivered it

00:46:52.16 Gavin was right when he texted it to me he goes I she has advanced angles

00:46:58.02 and he couldn't have been through like she

00:47:01.18 totally like Ethan hunted her way across his driveway

00:47:04.03 so he like hugged the wall she was looking over her shoulder and looking around

00:47:08.22 trying to spot like I don't know threats it was [ __ ] fascinating and then she

00:47:12.21 just disappeared into the darkness from when she came

00:47:15.06 and she did look a little like a left for dead witch he's not wrong

00:47:18.09 and she and she came like she didn't come from the street it looked like she

00:47:21.22 came out of my own garage somehow I don't know how she.

00:47:25.22 I assume she lives under the house I don't know maybe maybe they're my

00:47:30.01 cucumbers and she just picked them for me

00:47:33.12 either way it's weird I don't know what you want me to I guess it's a kindness

00:47:38.15 it's like old lady kindness that doesn't exist anymore but it is

00:47:41.16 I mean I've never met this person I've ne I'd have never expressed excitement

00:47:45.09 for foreign cucumbers have you ever seen a

00:47:48.08 leftover dead witch hanging around your neighborhood

00:47:52.06 and to be honest you know at least pickle them for me or something

00:47:55.09 what do you want did she want me to eat them as cucumbers or she

00:47:58.04 did she want me to take them the rest of the way oh yeah the note didn't

00:48:01.10 specially do whatever you want yeah I mean you could do you're given

00:48:04.10 what what is the current you still have them did you pass them on what what is

00:48:07.20 where is where are they they were passed on and I will say

00:48:11.22 no the note wasn't anywhere near the back in my defense

00:48:15.19 it was three feet from the back well I mean it was the only note on your porch

00:48:20.08 dude it wasn't like it was hidden in amongst all the other notes I saw it

00:48:25.23 instantly it was a yellow post-it note

00:48:28.12 all right well that's fair you know I'm in a hurry that's

00:48:33.12 true you're an hurry though the wasps have the lip the wasps that

00:48:38.04 survived the fan yeah they're now happily living back

00:48:40.21 inside the fan and I've not turned on since and we're just co-existing

00:48:44.05 peacefully you'll be happy to know that's great so I guess I I am happy to

00:48:48.09 know you you decided to go that route instead of removing them

00:48:51.07 uh I mean they've been in there a while by the looks of it did you

00:48:54.22 talk in the last podcast about how the crows are throwing [ __ ] at you

00:48:59.16 oh yeah that was after the wasp wasn't it yeah so

00:49:02.06 I got like ravens or something I don't know if it's a crow or a raven I can

00:49:05.12 never really tell it's whatever the bird is that goes

00:49:09.03 right yeah uh so they're in my trees and they just squawk at me every time

00:49:15.11 they see me if I walk into the backyard they start just screaming at me

00:49:20.11 and as soon as they can't see me they stop it's like peekaboo with a baby you

00:49:24.14 know you get an immediate reaction and uh if I'm under them they'll flap

00:49:29.01 about in the trees and snap branches off and throw them at me

00:49:33.20 he's not kidding he showed me a video it is it sounds impossible

00:49:38.06 but it is a hundred percent like it's obvious that they are

00:49:41.21 attacking him why what what it what have you done Gavin

00:49:46.10 what curse what has happened why is that everything

00:49:48.21 but does that explain the rave why would the raven crow

00:49:53.07 attack if you were dead I don't know they're just around

00:49:55.18 maybe it was like they had babies they were trying to protect or something but

00:49:58.21 it's too late it's too late in the year I already had

00:50:01.08 baby birds like three months ago are you an expert on the the mating

00:50:05.03 cycle of yes I I'm an expert on a crow mating cycle maybe you should have

00:50:10.02 taken the cucumbers maybe they're a peace offering that would have solved it

00:50:14.03 also based on what you said like did she how did she get the note to the door

00:50:18.03 like did she make a paper plane and throw it like how do you get the paper

00:50:23.14 if she just hooked was the was the note tied to the bag

00:50:26.02 I assume she swung she did the weird railing move the little sort of stealth

00:50:29.16 move and slid all of it and the note just blew off the bag I assume

00:50:34.10 when the wind took it to the door yeah I mean that's a nice thing

00:50:38.02 as an idea but I don't want to have to carry the cucumber

00:50:41.00 I would end up eating the cucumbers out of purely I don't want to take it to the

00:50:44.19 next test would you eat strange cucumber from someone you'd never met

00:50:49.06 if my options were eat strange cucumber from someone I've never met

00:50:52.19 or deliver it to the next house I'm eating the strange healer

00:50:58.12 there's no other option you want to do it away

00:51:01.18 no I well I would never that'd be a waste but there needs to be a system

00:51:07.04 on the note you need to indicate like there needs to be a marking if you pass

00:51:11.04 it on I want to know how many houses this has gone through

00:51:14.06 how many blocks maybe this cucumber might not even be from my neighborhood

00:51:17.23 this could be three blocks over they might not even be from her yeah

00:51:21.10 yeah I don't I see it would be crazy if it was from her I'd be shocked

00:51:24.16 I assume this has gone to multiple doors oh dude what if it's like it follows

00:51:28.18 and she just passed a curse on the cucumber the curse of the cucumber

00:51:32.05 and that's why the birds are flipping out and now you've passed it on I hope

00:51:36.19 I hope he did it I'm glad I got rid of it before I didn't even touch him

00:51:41.14 wow oh boy he's in the clear it follows the cucumber it follows curse

00:51:44.21 the sequel we've always wanted I love that the weirdness just comes from like

00:51:48.14 the strange fruit but Geoff I think was legitimately bad that there were

00:51:52.10 cucumbers and not pickles he was like these aren't in brine I was

00:51:55.16 like that's not the weird part though that's not the strangeness

00:52:00.17 you set it up all wrong I was I'm stunned

00:52:04.10 it's still weird a bag of cucumbers from a garden is not as weird

00:52:09.08 as a bag of pickles in brine why isn't that as weird

00:52:13.07 come on man what do you mean is it just the act of like no one puts

00:52:19.01 you don't pickle [ __ ] in a bag yeah yeah yeah you don't put Brian in about

00:52:23.06 okay everyone knows this you'd have to take it out of a jar which is already a

00:52:27.09 transportation method I still think that that only takes it from like a six

00:52:32.06 weird to a seven though uh no I feel like a bag of cucumbers is a five

00:52:36.19 and is like pickles with brine and a ziplock's like a solid eight

00:52:40.23 yeah that's amazing it's an easy really it's an it's a five to an eight Eric

00:52:44.02 while it's it's a huge gap because you have to take them out of the jar

00:52:49.17 it's just a weird thing yeah I wanted to hear the rest of what Andrew had to say

00:52:54.10 man it really is I just don't um you said that there was condensation inside

00:52:58.00 the bag is that what you were saying yeah that

00:53:00.14 was the sheen I was looking at I think the very moisture small amount of

00:53:04.09 condensation I think he's over well it was more when I left in fact how did

00:53:08.21 the condensation go maybe into the cucumber

00:53:12.06 I don't know what do you want from me what do you what does everyone want from

00:53:16.06 me I just I'm trying to just live my life showing up

00:53:20.21 that sounds great I mean I have to believe

00:53:25.03 that this is a jacob's ladder situation and you are dead and we are when people

00:53:32.15 talk about like simulation theory or whatever like oh they were just like

00:53:37.18 living in a simulation I think that you died or you're in a helicopter

00:53:43.10 dying and uh you are this is we are just inside your head

00:53:48.12 and the woman is a demon and the cucumbers represent

00:53:52.19 like you trying to get back to like the earthly realm

00:53:56.14 uh like why was she why did she look like a witch from a video game like a

00:54:01.14 dream half remembered from a video game from like long ago you

00:54:06.04 know what I mean like it's too many it's too many concentric circles this is

00:54:10.02 I I I am I like where Eric is going with this this is definitely you are

00:54:14.12 a Vietnam soldier an American Vietnam soldier you are bleeding out right now

00:54:18.11 and they are trying to save your life and you're

00:54:20.15 living you're living the next 30 years in your mind

00:54:23.19 and we're just a part of it oh my god and that lady that played the girl who

00:54:28.04 turned into a demon I think her name is Luis pena she died recently

00:54:31.21 too so it's all unraveling huh interesting

00:54:34.17 yeah and she died I think of uh I think she died of cirrhosis so

00:54:39.05 okay I mean in your head I guess because this is all

00:54:43.00 this is all invented by you oh maybe she's out of pickles

00:54:46.05 it'll mean something if it was a different vegetable would you been more

00:54:49.22 excited about it does the vegetable is it is the issue of you not wanting it

00:54:54.11 the weirdness of receiving it randomly or is it the fact that cucumber is a

00:54:58.12 lower tier on the vegetable list where do you put

00:55:01.12 cucumber on the vegetable list cucumber I mean I feel like no one ever

00:55:05.19 needs cucumber is the thing cucumber's always like an addition it's

00:55:10.08 never a mane and also america has these weird stubby little cucumbers

00:55:15.13 to make pickles with but I'm the cucumbers I like to eat the big long

00:55:19.00 ones the ones that like two feet long you're like a bigger

00:55:21.18 foot long so I don't really know what I would have done with it

00:55:25.02 I mean can you eat do the cucumbers that

00:55:27.02 turn into pickles taste the same as like an English cucumber

00:55:30.10 yeah I'd assume so I mean hey you could put that in a salad

00:55:35.03 you always got that as an option um sandwiches

00:55:37.02 cucumbers are fruit I don't think a salad is a salad without cucumber honestly

00:55:41.17 it's really it's a staple for me oh I disagree strongly yeah I love

00:55:45.14 the cucumber man I could eat cucumber all day long

00:55:48.20 that's great but I don't think they're needed for a salad as I said I feel like

00:55:52.16 the salad is just the lettuce or spinach or whatever you want to put

00:55:55.19 it's the blank canvas and then you put whatever you want into it yeah why do

00:55:59.04 you never make that then who are you talking to why does Andrew

00:56:02.12 never make the bog standard salad well I I do I just I I thought for I

00:56:07.12 wanted to make the greatest salad possible the pot to enhance the cream

00:56:10.23 potentially or like I've never had this before

00:56:13.20 if I'm not gonna like it in this salad I'll never like it outside of it

00:56:18.06 interesting slicing you know what we should do

00:56:20.16 we should come up with and I'm not saying we should do it right now because

00:56:23.20 we should put some thought into it but we should pick like a number of

00:56:27.11 ingredients like five or six or something

00:56:30.12 and then we all come up with the perfect salad

00:56:32.16 in our minds right like you're you pick whatever six ingredients

00:56:35.18 and you create the perfect salad I do and then Gavin do the same and then we

00:56:38.19 can release it and then let the audience decide which is the best

00:56:41.19 I see is this for the recipe book could be for yeah

00:56:44.17 and then we call that the ultimate like face salad or something do we have to do

00:56:48.19 it anonymously we would have to do it anonymously I

00:56:52.13 feel like salad has the greatest range salad can be amazing and it can be such

00:56:57.02 dog [ __ ] totally agree it's a great yeah

00:56:59.03 I yeah I'm trying to think of what is a more ranged food

00:57:01.20 I think you might be right I think it has the widest range whereas like stuff

00:57:05.05 like eggs eggs could be like okay or good

00:57:08.08 but maybe that's a bad example no but I think it's a good example

00:57:12.21 it can also it's an appetizer or it's a meal a main however like however you

00:57:16.06 want to present it it's got a lot of flexibility

00:57:18.12 yeah I feel the same way about honey mustard I feel like that's the condiment

00:57:22.23 wide range there's such a variety of honey mustard flavors

00:57:25.17 more so than any other condiment you can go place to place

00:57:28.19 and have wildly different tasting experiences I'd be willing to bet this

00:57:32.06 is the fifth face that you've mentioned honey mustard

00:57:35.04 you really like honeybusters you really do yeah it comes up a lot well we

00:57:39.04 did a we did a sauce thing and I don't know if I'd say it comes up

00:57:42.07 a lot was the last mention of honey mustard when I wanted to to make honey

00:57:45.07 mustard that was a long time ago like probably 2030 episodes ago no way

00:57:49.21 nice and the last ten it's in the live you brought up things that have wide

00:57:52.08 variety I think honey mustard is wide variety I was just trying to think of

00:57:55.15 others next week I'm going to talk about something brown nobody's nobody's

00:58:00.02 disagreeing we're just pointing out that it comes up

00:58:02.20 a lot I don't feel like it does I think it's just memorable when I bring

00:58:06.21 it up I think it's a great topic that everybody enjoys

00:58:10.05 do we always engage really well in your honeymoon

00:58:13.05 yeah you do I always get a text after on those episodes so that was a great show

00:58:17.16 so I'm trying to I'm sprinkling it in honeybuster whatever I can

00:58:20.13 it really I love the one thing yeah it elevates the dish it elevates the show

00:58:25.21 a little honey mustard do you think I should I should become a better neighbor

00:58:28.21 and start dumping food on my neighbor's doorsteps

00:58:31.11 that's such a great question I don't know how you I don't know what the

00:58:34.11 cucumber rebuttal would be well I think you get something that you

00:58:37.10 grew in your own garden I think you have well here's the problem

00:58:41.12 you don't know where she lives is she to your left or right the last

00:58:45.14 person that did it she's she's from my garage she came from under

00:58:49.11 the house she's a she might be a sleep stack

00:58:54.02 huh I think how do you do this in a way that isn't like an invasion of privacy

00:58:59.12 it'd be interesting to like put one thing to the left of you

00:59:03.10 one thing to the right of you and see how far it gets both ways do you

00:59:08.08 like a race of sorts I would I bet you that is almost like a

00:59:11.19 competition itself we have to pick the shittiest vegetable we could think of

00:59:16.10 and see how far it can get and whoever gets the furthest wins

00:59:20.10 like uh like a game of like vegetable telephone

00:59:22.15 yeah exactly like I don't I would never pick like carrots or potatoes

00:59:26.11 are not getting past two houses why because people are gonna eat them yeah

00:59:29.13 people are gonna like those items those are like commonly used great

00:59:33.00 vegetables does it have to be can it be a pro like I bet I could get a branston

00:59:36.17 pickle jar really far I bet that would travel no one's gonna ruin that no

00:59:41.12 people are gonna throw that away because they don't trust it they're just gonna

00:59:45.04 nobody knows what it is and it's like store-bought

00:59:48.00 yeah I don't think you can do store-bought I think it has to be it

00:59:51.12 can't be fruit because it just bruises it has to be like a

00:59:54.14 vegetable with some durability you're not gonna [ __ ] deal with apples in a

00:59:59.16 bag Geoff like let's just we can't do what about

01:00:01.18 swede what's a swede yeah what is that it's not a root veg in it no idea what

01:01:17.22 ass

01:04:28.13 neighbor you know yeah I don't know maybe don't maybe don't try to

01:04:33.03 uh maybe don't try to break into the pentagon to put them on their front porch

01:04:37.15 maybe just walk up the steps that are there and uh don't be all secretive

01:04:41.18 about it or maybe do freak them out I don't think you know

01:04:45.00 that there's a difference between not giving a [ __ ] and being open to people

01:05:04.06 that wouldn't end properly in the whole of season two

01:05:07.01 we've had the yelling this is the bike assist is not year two not season two

01:05:11.12 no well no that's a good question though

01:05:13.20 we're definitely in year two but have we had an episode that wouldn't end in

01:05:16.19 season two season just a little longer than yours

01:05:19.01 I think so because season two is it's been good for
