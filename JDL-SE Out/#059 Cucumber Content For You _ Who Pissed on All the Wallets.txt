00:00:33.16 Well uh hello and welcome to episode 59

00:00:36.17 of face according to Eric uh I'm Geoff Gavin and Andrew are alive

00:00:41.05 as well and uh I sent myself to you Eric you're all of us

00:00:45.12 what I said are alive as well ah okay oh okay it was all very oh it went

00:00:50.23 it fast I missed it yeah it was a very quick I I also missed it I thought we

00:00:54.21 were it's like a being john malkovich situation I thought we were in your head

00:00:58.12 for once I was actually early because I had to

00:01:01.12 come back in and consult Andrew about the uh the room layout

00:01:05.09 I had a lot of questions about the room layout and I wanted to consult Andrew

00:01:10.00 but I decided uh that I would just go with the

00:01:12.12 information he texted us two days ago that was the thing I couldn't remember

00:01:16.05 where I saw that oh yeah he was into slack

00:01:18.21 and I came in I was like where's that info you said in slack and then I had

00:01:22.04 other questions but I felt like unless you were gonna receive the same

00:01:25.00 info it wouldn't be worth me asking anything so I just stuck with the

00:01:28.15 information that we're both giving I offered to forward

00:01:31.16 all the answers to Geoff but still no questions so I'm excited to see

00:01:35.15 see the layout that you've yeah I put a lot of effort into it I think you guys

00:01:38.23 will like it let me also say because I very I I found out you know

00:01:43.20 that I made an uh a funny joke to Gavin that our podcast wasn't doing well and

00:01:47.07 then he thought it wasn't doing well for years and years and years

00:01:50.06 and uh well the podcast is barely a year old so not quite that long

00:01:53.03 uh but uh I just just to give you some good news Gavin

00:01:56.07 uh I got an email uh the other day that said uh last week's episode

00:02:00.07 which was well this is 59 we're recording I think last week's episode is

00:02:04.03 57 that we released is on track to be our best performing episode ever

00:02:08.20 ah what happened that was the uh cucumbers the cucumbers

00:02:12.18 it was your wasps I think the orgies the wasps yeah yeah

00:02:17.07 so no it was it was after the wasps yeah so

00:02:20.19 uh cucumbers and orgies is uh apparently a winning combination

00:02:25.12 I see congratulations things are trending up uh if episode if our most recent

00:02:31.02 episode is on pat is on track to be our best

00:02:33.06 performing episode then that can only mean that uh the next episode will will

00:02:38.15 probably be a lego I feel it already is we already recorded

00:02:41.18 that one that one's already guaranteed it's in the can

00:02:44.06 it's disappointing yeah well that's done it's just put pressure on this one I

00:02:47.18 think yeah yeah hey if anybody's got like we need to hit the cucumber

00:02:52.10 content and the homeless orgy content hard

00:02:55.20 so Andrew take it away with your next orgy story go

00:02:59.05 uh well I don't have one of those but I do I got some cucumber content for you

00:03:05.02 this week orchestrated I feel like the last thing

00:03:08.06 we do on this show is chase treads like yeah I will say you know actually

00:03:13.07 doing it we're gonna pause for one second you're

00:03:17.05 crediting orgies you're crediting cucumbers I think the real star of this

00:03:22.04 is [ __ ] honey mustard honey mustard has been a constant it's

00:03:25.19 rocketing to the moon honey mustard is the way to go if we

00:03:29.12 could get a spreadsheet of all the views on honey mustard

00:03:33.03 mentioned episodes and see if they trend higher than that's the future I think

00:03:38.04 if we don't make an official like Raymond sommer

00:03:42.13 honey mustard and release and sell it in store

00:03:44.18 we are not doing our jobs properly I agree I mean isn't that where it all began

00:03:48.20 was Andrew wanted to be behind some honeymoon yeah it was yeah well no it

00:03:52.13 was what what was it we're talking about I just didn't want to make it

00:03:56.15 no I think it was salad cream it went back to the original salad cream

00:04:00.02 conversation of like what's the best condiment and that was the intro to

00:04:03.16 honey mustard and expanded that was the origin story that was the origin yeah

00:04:08.03 yeah that's how it was created so I we should

00:04:10.22 this was a this was an interesting start to a podcast so let's cover what we're

00:04:15.12 going to cover today what uh Andrew you've got some cucumber content well

00:04:20.10 I have I'm excited about that uh we have uh the reveal of our

00:04:25.07 Andrews bedroom drawings uh I don't know how you feel about yours Gavin but I am

00:04:30.16 very jazzed about mine I worked hard on it I put probably

00:04:34.09 25 minutes into it dude I put I got I was doing it

00:04:37.14 uh well I'll just show it to you I I worked hard on it as well

00:04:39.20 and I was unhappy with my drawings so I decided to take it in a different

00:04:43.12 direction Eric said 25 minutes is too long 25

00:04:46.23 minutes is too long well how long would you have spent on it Eric uh

00:04:52.01 less than three two two and a half minutes you're just all right well it

00:04:55.10 sounds like it sounds like you have time so why didn't you whip one up oh I

00:04:58.11 didn't get it I wasn't unfortunately I wasn't part of the text conversation

00:05:02.18 with all that I could give you that nation I could give you that right now

00:05:07.12 it's one sentence [ __ ] it's not a lot uh I can probably go by memory

00:05:12.23 uh three doors all at the top bed at the bottom two windows

00:05:18.10 uh one hole where a door should be four walls three doors all at the top no

00:05:23.21 wall has multiple doors on it but one has two doorways

00:05:27.19 two windows bed at the back I spent I spent at least 45 minutes on it uh

00:05:32.14 I started and threw away and restarted a bunch on top of that

00:05:36.16 we we have all designed I found some online salad generator that by the way

00:05:41.11 there are a lot of online seller generators

00:05:44.00 but they're all related to [ __ ] to like stores like mad greens or wendy's or

00:05:48.23 whatever I don't want to push a corporate giant

00:05:51.18 so I found one that just appears to be like some healthy site

00:05:56.08 and uh I'm not crazy about the ingredients first of all

00:05:59.12 their idea of salad dressing is ludicrous there's zero salad dressing listed on

00:06:04.15 the salad dressing options the closest thing they had was lime juice or

00:06:09.08 salsa but the ingredients for salad are there

00:06:12.06 so we've all and by all I mean Gavin Geoff uh

00:06:15.18 Andrew and I believe nick have created our salads and sent them to Eric

00:06:20.07 what we're gonna do here is eric's gonna

00:06:23.01 read them blind and then we're gonna all try to guess

00:06:25.16 who made each salad then eventually down the road in person

00:06:29.02 I assume we will make those salads and then share them with each other and then

00:06:32.13 determine which one is the best tasting now I'm not sure if I did mine right but

00:06:36.12 I I didn't try and be funny at all I just thought which salad would I really

00:06:39.23 like to eat is that the right way to go about it yes

00:06:42.23 I made the salad out of those ingredients that would taste the best

00:06:48.06 to me I made a I went I went beyond that I I think I made an iconic salad

00:06:53.18 personally oh god I I knew I knew this was gonna happen where Geoff had an idea

00:06:59.14 that was simple and then Andrew started sending me stuff

00:07:03.23 that had subtext and I went this is going to be

00:07:08.11 the whole episode I took notes I saw a comment from one of the uh

00:07:12.09 one of the many comment leavers that watched listen to this show

00:07:15.13 and someone I think nailed it with Andrew and his salad is that

00:07:18.14 Andrew has always been trying to make a salad that enhances the cream

00:07:22.13 when you just want the cream to enhance the salad and that's exactly what he's

00:07:27.01 done at every point he's trying to make the ultimate salad to go with his smell

00:07:31.16 well okay that was the first attempt was I wanted to make the ultimate a salad a

00:07:35.22 canvas fitting for the paint that is salad cream

00:07:40.01 and you guys rejected that so then the second time I just got a regulation

00:07:44.02 salad and had it a second I don't know what you wanted I tried both

00:07:48.01 things I mean obviously I can't do it the first time twice I love stuff that's

00:07:53.11 regulation what other regulations it's got to be

00:07:56.21 regulation it's gotta be standard regulations

00:08:00.17 it's all like regulations and standards and we've got the standard ears the

00:08:03.16 standard windows the regulations there's like there's lots of rules you

00:08:07.22 could almost make some sort of like legal document around this yeah we

00:08:11.14 got the rules according to face yeah exactly some comment leavers should

00:08:15.16 make that I ask questions about the salad I'm the only one Geoff you

00:08:18.19 presented this idea and to be clear this is my cucumber content I assume

00:08:22.13 that you saw the cucumber numbers and we're like we need to introduce

00:08:26.00 vegetables to this show in some way that was my

00:08:29.07 connection of that's why we're making salads

00:08:31.05 I sent this tea I I was just thinking about it I was thinking about it and I

00:08:34.12 thought like oh this is a funny idea and then I sent it here's

00:08:37.14 here's how my brain works I sent it in the slack and then you guys all

00:08:42.08 responded kind of quickly and like positively and then in a way that thought

00:08:45.18 oh no I bet this is an idea that we had months and months ago that

00:08:50.06 we already submitted to the slack and I forgot about and now I'm trying to

00:08:53.23 claim it as my idea and this is probably an old idea

00:08:56.08 and at some point they're going to bring it up and be like [ __ ] you stole

00:08:59.07 this six months ago we already did this or something and so

00:09:01.22 I've been paranoid ever since I submit and which reminds me why I'm paranoid

00:09:06.00 sometimes to submit ideas to the show because I'm scared that I'm stealing

00:09:09.13 them from the show from the past and you guys are going to make fun of me

00:09:13.03 for it I feel like that was a much bigger problem when you were drunk

00:09:16.12 where we would have a conversation I'd be like oh what if we did this and then

00:09:19.12 like a month later he'd be like [ __ ]

00:09:21.20 let's do this and we would end up doing it but I'd be like I'm pretty sure

00:09:26.07 I'm pretty sure this idea a month ago I uh I also uh I think we could talk

00:09:30.21 about the break show yeah we could talk about I came up with some bath

00:09:35.23 some minor minor bathroom insights that I could cover

00:09:39.10 we uh we recently Gavin and I had a hangout

00:09:43.05 and in that period uh there was we had a moment in the bathroom we could talk

00:09:46.17 about uh and then and then unfortunately unfortunately because Gavin and I hung

00:09:52.08 out on Sunday uh it rained every day after that we had plans to film

00:09:57.14 the extreme bicycle stunt on Wednesday and uh I wrote out Wednesday morning I

00:10:02.19 got up at like seven in the morning on Wednesday and rode my bike out there to

00:10:07.09 check out the scene to practice and stuff and it was still it's still uh it's

00:10:12.05 at that point it was still a drainage ditch you know it's a drainage ditch so

00:10:16.10 it was still draining and uh it's not an aqua it's not an aqua uh

00:10:21.12 trick so we were unable to record it which really sucks because we're

00:10:24.15 recording these episodes back to back so I think in the first episode we said

00:10:27.21 we were gonna do this and now three episodes later we still haven't

00:10:32.04 done it yeah unfortunately there's so much going on

00:10:35.01 this is this episode feels like a table of contents where it's like

00:10:38.09 direction it could almost be a choose your own podcast direction

00:10:40.23 we're recording two right we're gonna record this one in the one right after

00:10:44.02 it so whatever we don't choose we'll choose the next episode I assume Gavin

00:10:48.12 and Andrew you guys have a ton of [ __ ]

00:10:51.01 too outside of cucumber content uh I will say that that answered one of

00:10:54.02 my main questions going into this is if you film the bike trick I texted Gavin I

00:10:58.15 think on Saturday that it was the highlight of my weekend

00:11:01.19 knowing that you may be doing this at any moment and just hoping that it came

00:11:05.03 together like any time I was doing anything I could be making lunch and in

00:11:08.13 my head as like Geoff could be filming a bike trip he

00:11:11.13 could be trying to do a bmx stunt the funny thing about that is the

00:11:14.19 original plan was to do it on the weekend on Saturday but then I

00:11:18.16 saw Gavin all day Friday at the break show and then I knew we were hanging out

00:11:21.23 Sunday because we were going to go to the movies so I just didn't think about

00:11:25.01 Saturday three days in a row would have been excessive

00:11:26.13 and I completely forgot about it and he never texted me to say hey are we going

00:11:30.02 to film this thing and so I never texted him we probably

00:11:33.02 could have done it Saturday yeah we made the mistake of hanging out

00:11:36.11 first and now we have to wait out the probably the next ten the ramifications

00:11:40.15 yeah yeah so that leads to my second question how

00:11:43.17 was the d-box family did you guys come together was it a good time that was the

00:11:47.14 other thing that got me excited so it was even better than d-box it was

00:11:52.12 really 4dx Eric what are your thoughts on it

00:11:56.07 what is 40x I never thought that I would be a guy

00:12:00.07 who would watch a movie that had water sprayed at you

00:12:04.03 and smoked shot at the screen and the seat

00:12:07.09 shaking the whole time and walk out and go

00:12:11.04 that was the best thing I've ever seen cinema be damned they just made it a

00:12:16.18 universal studios red what's funny is that you you walk in

00:12:20.17 and it looks like someone's like screwed an entire janitor's

00:12:24.21 closet onto the walls up at the top there's like fans there's all these

00:12:29.01 boxes and like pipes and lights and stuff it looks like an absolute mess

00:12:32.20 and that's all the tools for the movie and then the lights go down

00:12:36.10 there's smoke all over the movie but it kind of doesn't work

00:12:39.14 because it's immensely distracting to see all the movie covered up and also

00:12:42.15 it's rear projected so you're seeing the movie like all messed up on top

00:12:48.00 there's flashes the seats are swinging all around

00:12:52.08 yeah there's water in your face it ruled

00:12:55.12 there's a there's a button to turn water on and off there's uh if we were like

00:13:01.01 sort of in you know like the seventh or eighth row

00:13:04.21 so we were like past sort of like the flat four rows in the front

00:13:10.10 those rows when there was smoke could not see a thing

00:13:14.20 they were waving their arms to move the smoke so they could continue watching a

00:13:18.21 movie and [Laughter]

00:13:24.12 it creates such a rowdy environment like everyone in there

00:13:28.13 was just screaming at the top of their legs like stuff would happen

00:13:32.17 and Eric would be like why is going on I look at the top of his lungs and it was

00:13:37.18 just perfectly fine like it was the right place and the

00:13:40.20 right people to see that movie with it was phenomenal then I saw the movie

00:13:44.14 again without any of that and uh it was a bit quiet in there yeah let

00:13:49.16 me say something I didn't I I saw the movie with you on Sunday I didn't get to

00:13:54.09 experience the d-box trip however I did get to see something that I think

00:13:59.16 might be as good as that and that is when the break show was over

00:14:03.02 uh tim g rolled to pick you guys up uh right outside to take you to the movie

00:14:06.08 and I got to see tim g roll up in a Subaru outback

00:14:09.20 with cool guy sunglasses and then get out and go oh hold on a second and then

00:14:14.12 get out and take car seats out of the back to make room for you guys

00:14:17.12 so that you can peel out to go to your super cool movie together and that

00:14:21.01 in itself I just stopped and I watched that until you guys left and then I

00:14:24.08 without my business that was better than the d-box I'm

00:14:27.07 pretty sure I wish you could have come because

00:14:30.12 unfortunately the the seats that move are in like rows of four

00:14:33.08 you'd like to buy a four block and uh we had it was like

00:14:36.17 full but uh then we went and got coronas before we went and saw the movie

00:14:41.18 what what day what experience it was really I had a great time

00:14:44.16 and tim g's on a kick right now where we

00:14:46.18 were even commenting on it where we just

00:14:49.11 went wow man you really leaned into like the dad slash off-duty cop look

00:14:54.17 he's got he's got a full-on mustache yeah he has

00:14:58.10 a tie-dye shirt that says gazpacho season some shorts new balance shoes and man

00:15:03.17 that's a big old mustache like it's really he's got it he's boy

00:15:08.14 it's a big old mustache it's something and Gavin was uh it was Gavin's laundry

00:15:12.21 day so he was dressed like a cool guy as well

00:15:15.08 it was awesome you had a real and Andrew had a real problem with my shorts

00:15:19.10 during the last break it's not you they're not you man yeah you wear

00:15:22.22 salmon-colored uh button-up shorts that's all you own that's all you should own

00:15:26.17 look sometimes I gotta do laundry all right sometimes I gotta wear

00:15:31.05 shorts that I wear on a treadmill or on a walk I I understand

00:15:35.03 just don't do it in public again no it makes sense

00:15:38.21 it was it was weird seeing you in active shorts

00:15:40.18 it was weird seeing an active shorts it really was

00:15:44.00 it's bad I don't know why I don't know why you're an active dude I lived with

00:15:48.08 you for off and on for years and years and years

00:15:50.08 I must have seen you in like basketball shorts before

00:15:53.20 uh you might not have I just can't remember it and it was so shocking

00:15:58.07 it was so out of character I can't even imagine Gavin

00:16:01.15 shooting a basketball like that visual in my mind is just very weird to me

00:16:05.20 I feel like I let you guys down with by showing up

00:16:09.07 he should here's the thing with Gavin and sports he's probably great at

00:16:12.17 British sports yeah but we got to keep him away from American sports I'm sure

00:16:15.21 you've heard the story of the very first time he threw a baseball

00:16:20.04 to my daughter and uh hit her in the face and split her lip

00:16:23.09 so well okay is that gavin's fault or is that well she was like five or six

00:16:28.12 well and he chucked it at her like he was Nolan Ryan

00:16:33.01 oh overhand he was a wind-up I was I was receiving the instructions I'm like

00:16:38.06 how do people pitch they just throw it straight at the person with the the

00:16:41.13 glove or the bat and you're like yeah just do it like

00:16:44.01 this I did it and I just hit a five-year-old girl's skull

00:16:48.00 and I don't think I've ever thrown one since you threw it at her at her skull

00:16:54.08 well that's where the glove was luckily she she lived and uh she's mostly

00:16:58.20 she's mostly fine and I think almost forgiven me for it

00:17:02.04 yeah I think I think she's forgiven me at this point

00:17:05.09 I don't know if she's forgiven Andrew yet for uh for not watching that final

00:17:08.15 leprechaun movie with her though it's not my fault

00:17:11.09 I wanted to watch it she told me she told me one night

00:17:14.04 she was like hey I'm gonna do my I'm gonna watch leprechaun because we were

00:17:16.12 gonna watch survivor or something she's like I'm going to watch that final

00:17:18.12 leprechaun movie with Andrew and I was like okay glad you guys are

00:17:21.10 finally doing it she goes yeah me too I'm super excited

00:17:22.17 and then later I checked on and I was like hey I thought you're going to watch

00:17:26.02 that movie with Andrew and she goes oh he canceled he's too busy getting

00:17:29.11 ready for face and I was like ooh oh yikes no

00:17:32.12 what was what day was that there was there were multiple attempts I reached

00:17:36.18 out one day that she didn't see the message it's

00:17:39.10 we've gone back and forth we'll eventually get there

00:17:41.20 I'd love to watch it I'm excited about it I just want you both to know that

00:17:45.01 you've disappointed my daughter in different ways

00:17:47.07 that's great I feel like whenever I hear about faith through mili it's always

00:17:50.19 about the inconvenience that is the recording of face and how it's

00:17:53.23 getting in the way and it's loud it is very inconvenient Emily actually

00:17:58.03 uh she was telling me the other day she was like you guys need

00:18:01.02 to do a short at rooster teeth that's just

00:18:03.07 all of the girlfriends and spouses and kids that are like dealing with fridge

00:18:07.09 repairmen while they hear while in another room

00:18:10.12 they hear an adult man screaming [ __ ] my anus or whatever you know and

00:18:14.14 she's like it's like it could just cut to all the

00:18:18.02 different like all the different spouses going uh

00:18:20.13 well while we're on um we were still on f9 and stuff and that that would lead us

00:18:24.02 to uh bathroom incident Geoff what was going on well you and I

00:18:28.10 I assume in a similar fashion I had to pee one second into the movie

00:18:32.22 I have a real problem with I I just hate getting up

00:18:36.04 in a in a cinema and leaving the movie that I paid to

00:18:38.23 because you missed big chunks of it so I've always been one to hold it in but

00:18:42.10 it's really bad for you not only that but I felt an extra pressure because we

00:18:47.12 went uh Alfredo uh who works at a a chima hunter with us he he uh and Jackie

00:18:52.21 his uh girlfriend they rented out a theater to watch fast nine and so the only

00:18:58.17 people in the theater were our friends and people that we know

00:19:02.06 and there's maybe 20 of us so I felt like an extra pressure like

00:19:05.12 I'm not gonna be the and nobody was getting up to the bathroom I'm not gonna

00:19:09.03 be the only one to do it the first one and so I just held it in the entire and

00:19:13.16 by the way that is a long movie apparently way longer when

00:19:17.04 you're when you're up to your eyeballs in urine it's like two and a half hours

00:19:20.12 I assumed Gavin did the same thing so the second the credits rolled

00:19:24.00 I was I speedy Gonzalez out of the chair there was like a puff of smoke

00:19:28.02 and uh I look around and gavin's doing the same thing running so I was like

00:19:31.11 well I can't let him beat me to the bathroom so it was a foot race

00:19:33.01 and then we got there and we were the only two people in the bathroom there

00:19:37.05 was this giant row of like 20 urinals well first I was

00:19:40.23 I was doing that like speed hobble where you don't want to like run because

00:19:44.10 your bladder will pop but you're kind of like

00:19:47.05 punched and running but then Geoff hid behind the wall

00:19:51.04 and he was trying to jump out of me and.

00:19:55.11 I was trying to scare the p out of you yeah you jumped at me and I was just

00:19:59.12 like look I just really had to hold it I was like

00:20:02.02 I've got peace so bad and then you were like me too and we just sort of

00:20:05.13 we stopped messing with each other we were both on the same page and we both

00:20:08.22 ran to the bathroom and then so we went to opposite ends and we started peeing

00:20:13.04 and that didn't intend it to be this but it turned into a race to see who had

00:20:16.23 more p in them and who could pee longer and I don't know about you but that was

00:20:22.13 probably in my top 15

00:20:24.18 longest p's in my life it was probably my top three

00:20:28.02 I don't think I've pissed that long in maybe a decade

00:20:32.12 I at one point I couldn't stop like I was like I was looking at my dick

00:20:37.12 and I was like is this a joke like there can't be this much Pete

00:20:42.08 and it's still going and it's a decent stream too

00:20:44.06 and I'm looking at Gavin and he's still going and I'm thinking like okay well at

00:20:47.12 least it's not weird but then at some point Gavin stopped and

00:20:50.13 I kept going and I was starting to get a little scared like

00:20:53.17 like what do you do if you never stop peeing right like I started thinking

00:20:57.07 like do I call do I have Gavin call a doctor and get advice like

00:21:01.18 do I like we like hook some sort of a bucket to the end of my dick so that I

00:21:05.09 can move around I can walk and still pee it was and then I started so much

00:21:09.19 unspoken when you're peeing like when two people start peeing at the same time

00:21:14.06 it's just a normal piss it's a normal experience until

00:21:17.08 both people subconsciously realized that

00:21:19.11 these pisses have been going on a really long time

00:21:21.22 and I had that realization when I was about halfway through I still had about

00:21:25.08 half of it left in the tank at one point we were we kind of both had

00:21:29.02 that realization at the same time and I just

00:21:31.07 looked over to the other end of the bathroom and I could see Geoff's little

00:21:35.03 head as we're both just missing for so long we were just

00:21:38.00 both laughing while we were pissing it's such a weird moment but I love it

00:21:41.22 it was so great it was a really weird like

00:21:45.03 funny [ __ I wholesome bonding friendship moment

00:21:49.05 and all the whole time I was giggling like a [ __ ] nine-year-old

00:21:53.10 all I can think of is this is going to be so weird if somebody walks in the

00:21:56.08 bathroom and just giggling like children while we pee on the opposite sides of

00:22:01.09 the bathroom from each other and luckily we had the bathroom to ourselves for a

00:22:05.11 good six or seven minutes and nobody ever came in it was

00:22:08.15 it was great the the moment wasn't spoiled everyone was talking about the

00:22:11.17 movie they were like wrapping up the conversation

00:22:16.19 that's true people were saying they're goodbyes

00:22:20.04 hey what did everybody think of the movie uh I left the bathroom almost out

00:22:25.21 of breath uh it was really hard work

00:22:31.20 what a fast like I'm trying to think like what are longest recorded pisses

00:22:37.12 in human history I'm just like even like film history I'm thinking Austin powers

00:22:41.12 there's that extended piss sequence yeah yeah some breaks though

00:22:45.03 there's that uh Adam sandler comedy bit on his first album

00:22:48.12 I'm not aware of that one oh it's an audio thing yeah it's it's just like him

00:22:51.20 he can't stop pissing for like an hour it's a whole thing it's like

00:22:55.08 okay and you live that this is your life this is inspired by your

00:22:58.13 at this time yeah I guess we do that content in a deeper level

00:23:02.00 anyway Gavin I just want to say uh on record that's the most fun I've had

00:23:05.14 peeing in years and I'm I'm really really glad that I got to pee with you

00:23:10.17 for a long time and that it was such a fun funny p and

00:23:14.23 if you ever want a long pee again let me know I I I know it's hard to

00:23:20.18 to recreate uh magic but man I do

00:23:29.14 experiencing it and we both found it funny at the same moment oh it was magic

00:23:34.10 yeah it was it was what it's it's the oh it's the kind of moment you can only

00:23:37.11 have between two friends that have known each other for more than a decade

00:23:42.02 what was the previous most amount of fun you've had pissing Geoff

00:23:45.13 because this is this over this took the position of something else what is

00:23:49.22 number two I don't think I have like a I've got

00:23:52.16 I probably am there's probably a lot that don't come to mind

00:23:57.01 uh that I'm forgetting or I'm blanking on right now uh I've

00:24:00.04 I've peed in a lot of nefarious ways especially when I was younger

00:24:05.07 you know and and younger that I went on that security guard once didn't you

00:24:10.15 no yeah you did that's a great uh guard that sounds fun I was gonna

00:24:16.04 yeah no that's a good one uh I was thinking of a worse one uh yeah no uh

00:24:21.05 I mean I I don't know do I tell these stories

00:24:24.08 is it okay to tell this story because I've told it on other roost podcasts is

00:24:27.08 it you've told the the security guard one on this podcast oh well then I don't

00:24:31.11 have to tell it again there you go it's the worst one though uh

00:24:36.00 yo did you pee on his kids that would be worse no I didn't paint his kids I was

00:24:40.10 thinking about the time I peed in that guy's duffel bag before he

00:24:44.15 went to the airport I don't know that one I was roommates with this guy I was

00:24:49.14 roommates with this guy in journalism school at fort bend Harrison

00:24:54.18 who was such a prick and I tried to like him a lot

00:24:57.22 I'm not gonna say his name I'm not gonna do anything uh all the things that I

00:25:01.14 hate about him are super identifying so I won't say them uh but I will say

00:25:06.21 that he was I tried really hard to like him and he was just a

00:25:11.03 just a cocky prick and he he was never nice to me

00:25:13.10 and always rude and he graduated journalism school as we all most of us

00:25:17.12 did eventually and he went on to his duty station

00:25:20.15 wherever that was in the army and please take into consideration I am a 46 year

00:25:25.03 old man now I'm a different person I was 18 at the time

00:25:29.03 I was a very dumb very inexperienced very a volatile 18 year old and so I

00:25:33.11 I was talking to him the night before he was packing up his duffel bag

00:25:36.18 and uh you know because you throw everything into your duffel bag and then

00:25:39.19 you lock it and then you take off uh and you carry that around the airport

00:25:43.03 or whatever and so he was like yeah I'm getting up I gotta get up pretty early

00:25:46.03 uh my flight's at like seven a.m so I'm gonna I'm gonna leave the room at like

00:25:51.22 5 a.m so uh to meet the you know driver or whatever so do you want to say

00:25:56.01 you know best of luck it was nice being a roommate with you for

00:25:59.03 six months or whatever and I was like yeah okay cool so I got up at 4 am

00:26:04.02 before he got up and while he was still asleep I

00:26:07.09 opened up his duffel bag he hadn't locked it yet

00:26:10.04 and uh in it were his uh class a shoes uh which are like army dress shoes and I

00:26:15.10 I took them in the bathroom and I peed in them a little bit

00:26:16.23 and then I put them back in the duffel bag and then I put all his clothes back

00:26:20.06 in and then for good measure I just peed in

00:26:22.22 the duffel bag a little bit and then I shut it up and then I went back to bed

00:26:25.05 and I never talked to him or saw him again I assume he figured it out at some

00:26:29.03 point not something I would do now I bet not but

00:26:33.16 like when did you think he realized uh well probably when he opened up the

00:26:38.00 duffel bag wherever he got when he got there

00:26:41.20 maybe he just thought like a dog at the airport pissed at him or something

00:26:46.16 maybe he thought a dog in the airport but you know

00:26:50.11 that was also like urine was commonplace like these are a bunch of

00:26:53.20 like these are 1819 year old kids that are [ __ ] living in military barracks

00:26:58.21 they can't go anywhere so they get they just do dumb [ __ ]

00:27:01.11 like a week before that I remember this just popped into my head we we shared a

00:27:05.07 bathroom with like suite mates and there were two other dudes on the other side

00:27:08.15 a week before that I was woken up at two

00:27:12.00 in the morning by screaming and laughing and I ran into the other room uh

00:27:17.07 and one of these guys one of the two guys I know

00:27:20.15 was laughing while another guy was trying to beat him up

00:27:23.16 and they were both naked and figured out uh what happened was the guy came in

00:27:28.06 drunk and he thought it would be funny to piss on his roommate's head while he

00:27:31.22 was sleeping and so the roommate woke up because he

00:27:34.10 was getting pissed on in the head and so he was angry the other and he

00:27:38.02 started beating the [ __ ] out of the guy the other guy was just drunk and

00:27:41.18 laughing and still pissing and so there was like a tangle of urine

00:27:45.00 and 19 or 22 year old dudes or however old they were

00:27:47.21 just rolling around one of them was screaming and trying to kill the other

00:27:51.18 one the other one's just laughing his [ __ ] ass off

00:27:54.15 uh still peeing and so there was that kind of [ __ ] happened all the time

00:27:58.22 I loved the phrasing that someone woke up because they were getting pissed on

00:28:03.18 in the head I had dude I had it people do weird [ __ ]

00:28:06.16 in the army I went on a trip one time to go surfing at port aransas with some

00:28:09.23 friends of mine the guy that taught me how the surf army trip right this is

00:28:13.07 when I was stationed at fort hood and I woke up in the middle of the night

00:28:17.07 because one of my friends was I was laughing and it was like loud and

00:28:21.18 I woke up and one of my friends this guy dale

00:28:23.15 had gotten really really drunk we were all drunk you know we were kids

00:28:28.12 and uh and he had taken all of our wallets

00:28:29.11 and he had put them in the corner of a mo we were like saying that like a motel

00:28:33.12 six and he had put them all in the corner of

00:28:36.06 the room and was just pissing on them his wallet my wallet my friend mike's

00:28:40.17 wallet my friend pete's wallet he just put them

00:28:43.13 in a pile and was just pissing on our wallets

00:28:46.06 still to this day I don't know why he did it he was like black out drunk

00:28:49.06 he just thought it would be a funny thing to do weird decision

00:28:52.20 didn't remember doing it in the morning had no memory of it

00:28:56.17 I have so much respect that he put his to the pile too

00:29:00.21 his was in there too he's like gonna make it fair yeah

00:29:05.09 that's like a who pisses on a wallet b who pisses on all the ones

00:29:09.20 in front of us like I'm waking people up

00:29:12.03 like it's Pete what's going on dale stop it what are you doing man he's like

00:29:16.13 he had no [ __ ] clue it was like he was like sleep drunk pissing but he was

00:29:20.08 laughing when he died it was [ __ ] weird man I when you piss

00:29:24.12 on somebody when you use piss as a weapon

00:29:25.18 and you piss on the head of someone and they go for the attack and you keep

00:29:29.05 pissing it's a great move it's really hard to

00:29:31.21 counter like how are you gonna go after him

00:29:33.18 that's what I'm well I know it's hard for the guy to stop but

00:29:36.21 I'm saying like what when you go to punch him you're just gonna get peed on

00:29:40.10 more the guy just wins like you don't lose

00:29:41.01 even if you're getting beat up you're continuing to win because you're pissing

00:29:44.12 on the person it's really hard to get in non-pissing range

00:29:49.04 yeah yeah it would be difficult I don't want to go off on a tangent but I

00:29:52.15 probably have four or five I probably have more pissing stories too

00:29:55.19 about the army is a it's a urine-filled uh environment it sounds like Eric wants

00:30:00.03 us to get away from piss and onto the salad and drawing stuff

00:30:03.06 oh maybe we could have some piss next week that's okay I think we've covered

00:30:08.04 enough p and I think enough people I think enough people were covered in pee

00:30:11.09 in this episode that we can just move on.

00:33:28.06 want to hop on and uh read the I guess we should take notes right on

00:33:33.02 there's gonna be four salads there will be four salads ladies and gentlemen

00:33:38.02 welcome I have four salads that I'm going to be sharing with you today

00:33:42.17 thank you so much for joining me for the salad segment

00:33:45.17 face um I'll be reading four salads uh I think instead of you guys um

00:33:50.06 do we guess right away after I give you what the salads are or do you write them

00:33:53.11 down and then we guess do we go one two three four or what would you like to do

00:33:57.12 I think we do one at a time okay then we move to the next one and we'll get

00:34:00.12 so we won't know all the salads before we're making the guess correct

00:34:03.16 uh I guess then we'll yeah it'll narrow down who has what but it's just a lot of

00:34:07.04 ingredients to remember all four and one I'm just gonna I think

00:34:10.09 you just read them and I'm gonna write down my impressions as you go

00:34:13.23 okay okay well here's the first salad I won't say who it is

00:34:18.08 obviously Geoff has used a solid generator

00:34:21.12 that we are all supposed to use and have used and there's a lot here

00:34:24.19 so uh bear with us also dressing I think

00:34:27.03 will not factor in because the dressings that were on this site were

00:34:30.17 insane and we so uh do not so please ignore that there's no dressing I mean

00:34:34.07 it's not it's not generator and it's random you you pick the ingredients

00:34:37.12 it generates the recipe yes correct which which is really just the recipe of

00:34:42.04 here are all of these things tear them up and put them in a bowl put them in a

00:36:34.23 you okay here you're right Eric the point of the game you're missing a green

00:36:39.21 zone point of the game [Music]

00:36:43.13 the point was that you're supposed to you're supposed to guess who it is and

00:36:49.14 he just stepped in.

00:36:53.01 I had already written down his name the second Eric said

00:36:57.21 oh boy I wrote that Andrew Eric told us everything we needed to know before he

00:37:01.12 made a single introduction I'm going to start at the top because

00:37:04.18 it's all out of order and I'm just going to add these ingredients why didn't you

00:37:08.21 just do a screens hot I listen this is a screens hot

00:37:13.04 I screenshotted it I just I thought that was easier to read what I say it's

00:37:18.17 not here it is apparently not raisins bell peppers kidney beans chicken

00:37:25.09 cheddar cheese Boston lettuce snake orange cashews

00:37:32.00 corn blueberries broccoli spinach

00:37:39.12 you're leaving out some very important details of this salad

00:37:43.17 I can only read the ingredients and then you can tell everyone about your idea

00:37:49.15 okay here is the lat this is it's so it was so difficult to parse that uh

00:37:55.16 here is the last salad okay greens romaine vegetables carrots cucumber

00:38:00.19 tomato radish mushroom red cabbage fruit none

00:38:06.00 protein chickpeas and chicken grains none yummify sunflower seeds

00:38:13.07 bacon cheese and croutons those are the four salads for face if

00:38:19.03 you want to make those salads and then eat them

00:38:21.21 uh can you take a picture and send it to us because I especially the

00:38:26.17 third one that I read um [Laughter]

00:38:30.08 starts with raisins I love Andrew just stepping into the mystery salad and

00:38:34.13 breaking Eric yeah that's not all the greens those are the

00:38:37.22 greens it's not about the greens don't forget the spinach the spinach is

00:38:42.18 very important to the salad okay well I have mine written down Gavin

00:38:47.09 do you have yours Andrew do you have yours okay yeah just what you

00:38:51.08 do you mean like predicting yes who do you believe was salad number one that's

00:38:56.10 with the romaine watercress iceberg lettuce the standouts are pine

00:39:00.15 nuts go cheese croutons really and eggs to me I wrote down nick okay uh

00:39:05.12 Andrew do you have a guess I originally wrote down nick and then I swapped the

00:39:08.19 gap okay and Gavin do you have a guess I do uh-huh and what's your guess

00:39:14.06 it was me damn it that was damn it I got that one wrong

00:39:18.01 gavin's salad that was a tough one I would eat that sounds good it does

00:39:22.11 that sounded like it I I like the uh the eggs and everything in there very

00:39:26.13 very interesting very very boiled eggs I do need to specify I want the mushrooms

00:39:29.18 raw okay yeah obviously mushroom's gotta be

00:39:32.05 raw okay yeah what is the name of your salad

00:39:34.20 what's the name of it uh-huh a salad needs a name I feel like that's a key

00:39:38.09 part of salad criteria you need a name for yourself right with this

00:39:42.04 thing that Andrew invented it needs a name I got a name I got a name

00:39:47.12 every salad has a name regulation salad that's a good name it's a great name

00:39:51.10 incredible it's a great name incredible um so that's the regulation salad the

00:39:55.12 second salad spinach this is the one with the salsa and guacamole

00:40:00.04 cheese and crouton the corns the chicken no fruit the second actually

00:40:05.02 I went for nick on this one okay and it is a topping

00:40:08.02 yeah I went nick there's a lot of dressing okay Andrew Geoff I

00:40:11.12 I went with Gavin but obviously I think I think nick is the answer and the

00:40:15.03 answer is nick yeah absolutely um okay now here on to the third

00:40:19.07 salad um uh I wrote down Andrew oh okay I mean to refresh your memory

00:40:24.21 this is the one that starts with raisins yeah raisins and oranges

00:40:30.12 yeah uh-huh and uh Gavin do you have a guess on the third salad

00:40:35.01 I went with uh mr panton okay and Andrew do you have a guess also on the third

00:40:38.10 salad that would be my salad this would be my creation what's the name

00:40:42.21 of your salad well this is an important I wanted to honor somebody who is close

00:40:47.00 to the show a real icon just in the world in general this is

00:40:51.14 called the dinner zimmer salad uh this is the ingredients as I sent to Eric

00:40:56.12 I have taken every place he has worked and I have I have sourced an ingredient

00:41:01.12 that is local to that place when you think of these places these ingredients

00:41:06.16 apply to those places they're iconic I will take any questions and also

00:41:11.15 I think it's sort of cowardly to not have a dressing it's a key part of the

00:41:15.00 salad even if we're not using the spreadsheet or whatever

00:41:18.08 so it is served and this is my honey mustard mention

00:41:21.07 honey mustard vinaigrette already got honey mustard in earlier but this is my

00:41:24.21 guarantee gonna mention honey mustard the dinner

00:41:28.15 zimmer but I must point out that once again we were trying to make

00:41:31.18 like we're trying to make just a good base salad this is the salad that I

00:41:35.12 would eat okay all right great so then salad

00:41:39.05 salad four it sounds like uh is pretty obviously my salad

00:41:43.11 yeah that is the one with the flowers the bacon crouton chickpeas

00:41:47.07 I was 100 wait a minute so you and Andrew both were 100

00:41:51.00 yeah congratulations the only one way to go yeah congratulations guys

00:41:55.14 Boston lettuce huh yeah yeah so uh so then Gavin you're official I don't

00:42:00.14 nick's not here so we can't ask him his salad name unless he included it

00:42:05.09 he did he did not okay so we're going to call so gavin's is called

00:42:08.10 regulation salad is that right that is Andrew yours is called the

00:42:12.10 the dinner zimmer salad the dinner zimmer yeah okay

00:42:16.13 that's interesting I had a I had a name as well uh

00:42:19.13 funny how the how our naming conventions uh

00:42:22.12 tend to overlap my my salad is called the regulation zimmer salad

00:42:30.08 so that's interesting you came up with that

00:42:33.16 two seconds ago oh no no it's uh I came up with it before that

00:42:38.21 interesting yeah I'm gonna send uh this is this was my full note for my salad

00:42:48.00 no no no no that was he sent this unprovoked with no explanation

00:42:55.03 well okay what happened was I was gonna edit a few things when I sent it but

00:42:59.13 when you hit enter and slack it just sends the message just trying to

00:43:04.06 drop down so I just said whoops I still have stuff I want to add

00:43:07.09 I mean you can edit on you can edit that post

00:43:10.12 I don't you know I don't know how to do that it seems like work

00:43:13.22 well I wanted a drop down how do you do the drop down without hitting enter

00:43:17.03 without submitting what's the drop what do you mean the

00:43:20.21 drop down you see how it's like one line la dodgers next line Chicago shift

00:43:25.00 oh really that's how you do that well I think in every field everywhere that's

00:43:28.00 how you get down online yeah that would be cool without I didn't know that okay

00:43:33.16 this is my notes these are the full extensive notes

00:43:36.23 of my salad I did a lot of research I thought a lot about it

00:43:40.21 because I thought people remember George foreman sponsored a grill

00:43:45.12 steak well George foreman was born in Texas he's a Texas icon when you think

00:43:50.07 of George foreman you think of the George foreman grill name a better thing

00:43:54.10 to grill than a steak Texas mystic Yankees nuts for nuts cashews

00:44:00.13 I mean don zimmer seemed like a nuts guy he seemed like a nuts dude so these are

00:44:05.16 just your justifications for these yeah these are yeah this is

00:44:09.20 why these things are what they are I could see don zimmer going to the

00:44:13.15 stadium getting a nut like getting getting some nuts from the vendor

00:44:17.11 there's a bunch of vendors nut for nuts the leading vendor in new york for nuts

00:44:22.15 new york mets king of queens Kevin James loves pizza

00:44:27.03 end result tomato yeah well the new york mets they're based in

00:44:29.23 queens so I went to the king of queens and if you search

00:44:33.20 Kevin James food you get a bunch of photos of him eating pizza

00:44:38.12 the guy loves pizza so to honor the king of queens

00:44:42.06 where don zimmer played or was yeah I think he's a player

00:44:44.20 for the mets got a tomato I like that Eric thought that 25 minutes was too

00:44:49.11 much time to invest in recreating uh by drawing Andrew's room Andrew has

00:44:54.04 clearly put days of work into this this is this is like

00:44:58.13 no this was listen you wanted me you said the salad thing I put the time in

00:45:02.18 I felt I appreciate it it's not a criticism of you I

00:45:06.15 I appreciate you the effort that you've put into this Washington

00:45:10.00 senators Washington they were in do do when I think of do you think of Daniel

00:45:15.03 cormier one of the greatest mma fighters of all time

00:45:17.08 guy loves pop eyes gotta go with chicken did a whole music video about popeye's

00:45:21.05 chicken dancing about it it's a clear chicken take I don't know

00:45:24.19 what you want name something more californian than California raisins.

00:45:29.09 [Laughter]

00:45:31.14 But you got can't oranges I I always think of oranges with California you

00:45:36.10 didn't even use oranges there I think I didn't work for oranges I got

00:45:41.02 the Montreal expos classic restaurant the orange julep it's a giant orange

00:45:46.04 they serve orange products hot dogs iconic staple of Montreal didn't need it

00:45:51.16 classic restaurant oh I'm exhausted by that

00:45:54.00 yeah what was your tampa ingredient uh john cena loves broccoli broccoli so

00:45:59.04 john cena born in tampa uh clearly he's big right now in the

00:46:03.04 fast movies he's part of the family in general we love some john cena

00:46:07.01 what's the ingredient from that place let me think of someone who likes

00:46:11.07 something from there I don't understand john john cena is from Massachusetts

00:46:16.23 is he yeah he's from Massachusetts let's let's do it cause I Google oh

00:46:22.06 no he was born he's built from west new bury Massachusetts which is not

00:46:27.16 awesome huh but that's where he's I'm pretty sure born and raised

00:46:32.20 john cena oh well maybe he went to Florida once

00:46:36.12 no he was born he was out I got it he was in that movie

00:46:40.14 sisters and that took place in Orlando so maybe that's what you're thinking of

00:46:45.11 oh I gotta I could have I searched famous people that were born

00:46:49.14 in tampa tampa bay known for I guess maybe I didn't hmm

00:46:55.07 well that's disappointing I'm gonna have to reevaluate I'm gonna have to

00:46:59.21 reevaluate tampa [Music]

00:47:01.16 I would not recommend searching what john cena's favorite food is it is uh

00:47:06.20 it goes a place you do not you would not anticipate

00:47:11.02 oh that's a whole thing good to know yeah you so you can't find the

00:47:15.16 documentation that says he's that you found initially that says he's from tampa

00:47:20.12 uh no I cannot I don't know where I got that from I I guess

00:47:24.11 I'll look into it I'm sure I read it somewhere I didn't just come up with

00:47:28.12 tampa bay john cena I was very excited about that too

00:47:33.01 what a disappointment of a reveal that is [Music]

00:47:36.17 I feel like that really undercuts my salad that really hurts the theme of it

00:47:41.15 oh man I'm sorry buddy that's sad I still think I have the best ah [ __ ]

00:47:47.06 are you tell I'm older than john cena yeah what do you mean yeah that's why is

00:47:51.07 that is that surprising to you he's an action movie star

00:47:54.23 he seems like such a well sells Liam neeson dumb-ass he seems like such a

00:47:58.12 grown-up to me for Reynolds j you think john cena is a grown-up he

00:48:03.06 seems like a grown-up to me he like he's he worked for like pro

00:48:07.19 he's a pro wrestler and like dressed like a giant toddler what I didn't

00:48:15.01 he did dress like a giant toddler however uh

00:48:18.04 he feels like a grown-up to me it's the same problem I have a fast and furious

00:48:21.08 he's supposed to be vin diesel's younger brother and I just

00:48:24.02 can't make it make sense that he's younger than vin diesel I know he

00:48:28.08 is really but in my head vin diesel's like I don't know

00:48:31.00 like a 22 year old and an old dude are you serious

00:48:36.04 in my head vin diesel is like 55. He is about 55. Yeah

00:48:40.06 I just think of him forever as like I don't know

00:48:43.20 you don't like you don't think of I don't think him as a grown-up I don't

00:48:47.18 know what a weird thing that is I guess why why do you not view him as

00:48:51.08 it's like how he looks I guess so I don't know I don't know

00:48:55.09 what it is he just like maybe it's because it's boyish maybe

00:48:59.14 it's because most of my vin diesel has been vin diesel in fast and the

00:49:04.13 furious and he his character wears the same clothes in

00:49:08.15 one as he does in nine and so in in one he's like 19 and in nine he's

00:49:13.14 80 and he's still wearing the same like he's not 19 and one

00:49:18.01 how old is he in one I got to be in his 30s

00:49:21.12 I'd say late 20s to early 30s in the story he's supposed to be in his 30s

00:49:26.09 oh in the story I'd say mid-20s would be my guess

00:49:31.00 mid to late once again how old is this I mean they got a show's driver license

00:49:36.06 I liked in the new one where they do a flashback to 1989

00:49:39.16 and I just looked at vin diesel's character and just thought

00:49:43.14 vindica wishes he looked like that in 1982 oh yeah

00:49:47.03 wasn't he selling shark toys in 1989

00:49:49.19 I feel like Geoff just constantly has vin diesel shark toys

00:49:53.16 vin diesel as his how old he is we're the shark toys called you know

00:49:57.23 what I'm talking about Eric I feel like you're the only one the

00:50:01.18 shark toys they're called street sharks they were awesome thank you yeah it's

00:50:06.19 awesome yeah this is a great let's drop this in I feel like in Geoff's head

00:50:12.00 this is how are we so are we cutting all this part out or what's

00:50:15.02 going on like this isn't like I can't amaze

00:50:18.03 this is just Andrew going shark toys shark toys shark toys and Geoff going

00:50:23.02 how old is vin diesel in fast there's no way this makes that

00:50:28.05 vin diesel how old is Dominic toretto in season in the first place season one.

00:50:33.13 [Laughter]

00:50:36.00 I guess he kind of did look like that that was a pretty accurate portrayal of

00:50:40.07 him him as a youngster then I Google how old is Dominic toretto in

00:50:44.10 the fast and furious at 40

00:50:46.10 is the first thing that pops up 40 as of the eighth film

00:50:49.09 yeah look at this how old is okay this is a screen

00:50:52.20 look at those two pictures he's that's why I don't think he's a grown-up

00:50:56.06 because he's still wearing the same clothes he was wearing he's still

00:50:59.03 wearing the same shirt he was wearing when he was 19.

00:51:01.12 The only thing that's the same is the shirt everything else is aged rapidly

00:51:05.17 well obviously he looks completely different I think but I think I don't

00:51:07.20 think of him as a grownup I think it was a man child

00:51:10.23 I'm not saying I don't think of him as old I just don't think

00:51:14.01 there's a grownup this is the weirdest tangent we've had

00:51:17.07 I don't understand why it's weird there's lots of people that are old that

00:51:20.05 I don't think of as like old and there's lots of people that are

00:51:22.20 young that I think of as like being a grown-up is all about like how

00:51:27.07 you carry yourself it's about you yeah yeah I get that

00:51:31.20 oh dom's date of birth august 29th 1976.

00:51:34.17 Yeah I saw that okay so when did the first movie come out

00:51:37.05 I've well the year it came out it doesn't represent necessarily what year

00:51:41.09 the story took place in what year did the story take place I

00:51:45.09 have no idea the year was I don't think it was a period piece

00:51:48.08 I think it was in the in the year that you think that every so the year of the

00:51:52.23 movie is the year of the story of as well like they're connected

00:51:57.05 I think we can assume that they're close okay

00:52:02.01 minus 19. This whole bit it's small this is like

00:52:05.03 we have to cut this out like what is it according to this no it's kind of

00:52:09.08 that's fine according to this he was about 20 according to the story he

00:52:12.16 should have been about 25 years old in fast one

00:52:15.09 it's not I don't think your point is weird Geoff I think vin diesel is a weird

00:52:19.10 person to be the president of the younger than he looks club really that's

00:52:23.11 what I think is odd yeah I don't think vindy I think vin diesel looks his age

00:52:26.20 not younger than he looks younger than he presents himself an act

00:52:31.18 you've lost me now it's what I just said earlier being a grown-up

00:52:36.12 isn't about age as much as how you carry yourself in the demeanor I don't think

00:52:40.15 he carries himself as a grown-up okay I see what you're saying I just

00:52:44.12 don't understand how it's hard not to hard not to understand what you're

00:52:47.14 saying yeah I feel like it's pretty [ __ ] clear what I'm saying and it's very

00:52:51.13 well I I think it's like partially understood and also partially just

00:52:54.15 baffled now I feel like we established that but we also established that about

00:52:57.16 eight minutes ago and now we've just been quietly yeah but that all got cut

00:53:02.14 okay so you wanna should we move on to the

00:53:05.15 the room yeah can you maybe what no go ahead

00:53:08.15 I'm just gonna say maybe we save we're all like an hour in maybe we should save

00:53:11.22 that for next week wow no no because no because the audience

00:53:15.02 will [ __ ] kill you just oh we got it too we could do we could do

00:53:19.07 the room next week oh we should do the room now

00:53:22.17 okay okay you want to do the room now well how do we want to do this

00:53:27.16 uh well let's do this Andrew why don't you

00:53:28.00 describe uh once again for us I think you already read it earlier but

00:53:32.09 okay one more time just read the description you gave us of your bedroom

00:53:36.17 and do we have a transition to this bit or are we just gonna

00:53:40.02 where do we leave off I don't this is I don't know the best episode of this

00:53:44.20 show

00:53:46.15 what do you mean well if we're gonna cut all that last bit

00:53:50.15 or a lot of that last bit how do we get from that to the room

00:54:02.10 [ __ ] sure four walls three doors all right wait

00:54:10.02 wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait hang on hang on

00:54:13.03 hang on hang on start over because I wanna I wanna get this clean

00:54:15.19 so that way everyone can hear it and draw themselves I'm just feeling sorry

00:54:19.03 for nick okay four walls three doors all at the top no wall has

00:54:24.19 multiple doors on it but one has two doorways two windows

00:54:29.18 bet at the back I don't know why I did that they've all written their versions

00:54:34.00 the previous week that's the whole point of the last one

00:54:37.14 we did this we covered this it's to recap

00:54:40.03 yes okay okay Jesus Christ fair enough well Eric just said it was for people to

00:54:44.17 write he wanted it clean so people could continue the reason the whole reason

00:54:48.19 we're doing this if you didn't listen last week

00:54:51.16 is because we've been hearing about the mystery that is Andrew panton's room

00:54:57.12 uh for 575859 episodes now and so we had the idea last episode to draw

00:55:02.19 like a top-down view of what we think andrew's room looks like and so those

00:55:06.07 are the instructions he gave us Gavin would you like to drop your room

00:55:11.03 into the discord can do what the [ __ I oh holy [ __ ]

00:55:15.11 Wow no door door this is a lot to unpack window waffle maker

00:55:22.02 I didn't put Andrew is is depicted in yellow and all the labeling is in blue

00:55:31.18 oh he had a piss I assume I mean he is pissed boy

00:55:35.09 we haven't really covered like what he does after he's looked at piss but I I

00:55:39.08 thought maybe yeah the sushi box yeah Eric and the fire extinguisher

00:55:44.06 waffle maker and you've got the tumbleweed with a handle in the top left

00:55:49.14 oh my god first off uh should now les should we ask Andrew what he thinks

00:55:54.03 how close it is or should uh should we show mine and then do both of them

00:55:57.12 I think we should show you well I assume Andrew would have also drawn the actual

00:56:01.16 room to compare ours to no why would I draw the room so we know what

00:56:05.23 we know what I took no I took a video of the room I did a video the room and I

00:56:09.07 have a I have a blueprint of the what the the

00:56:14.20 space I used uh I used the tool an architectural design tool.

00:56:21.14 I like the tools open into each other they do

00:56:24.19 so at the top at the top you've got the door leading into the rest of the house

00:56:30.10 where I assume other people live immediately to the right of that

00:56:34.15 is a is a desk with a fire extinguisher uh with a

00:56:37.10 with a microphone attached to it next to a mini frizz

00:56:40.06 all the way to the right is the door to the [ __ ] that's where you go and you

00:56:44.08 do your shits and your baths then down that wall is a hole where a

00:56:48.02 closet is where you make your hot dogs uh middle mo he said most of the room is

00:56:52.12 bed so I tried to make the bed as large as possible

00:56:55.02 don't want to forget the casio keyboard put the eight pillows on didn't have

00:56:58.19 room for the waffle maker but we haven't talked about waffles in a while I

00:57:02.08 included the pam and the keurig just in case on the nightstand

00:57:05.16 oh on the other side you have uh you have a sushi box because I also

00:57:09.01 wanted to be sure to include that on the left wall you've got a window

00:57:13.07 from that window you can look to the right and see mcdonald's and ladies pee

00:57:18.13 sight line to peeling further up that door is the outside door

00:57:21.18 which opens up well it opens in uh but uh it goes straight to mcdonald's and

00:57:25.17 urine how close was I how close was Gavin Andrew I got it I can't believe

00:57:29.12 how similar these are and also the level of effort like I obviously spent the

00:57:33.05 time doing it in the drawing Geoff spent the

00:57:36.13 time getting hold of an architectural tool and real images at the big keyboard

00:57:41.14 they're so similar I love it they're so simple I

00:57:44.23 I don't know how to I don't know how to measure who's more correct like the

00:57:50.10 level of detail in both is fantastic I'm gonna drop the

00:57:54.02 blueprint first of just the space and then I will do the video of the room

00:57:59.02 so this is this is pulled that's just really that's

00:58:02.19 the tiniest yeah that's unfortunate that did not work out very well

00:58:08.23 we will move to the video I don't know Eric

00:58:12.08 doesn't make it smaller I don't come from your phone

00:58:16.22 is that what they know no that no that came from my computer

00:58:21.18 I did that what's the resolution 12x8

00:58:25.06 it was a screen grab you sent us a 14 pixel image

00:58:31.14 we got to put that in all of its size and glory on the Instagram

00:58:49.14 there's that oh my god I [ __ ] nailed it

00:58:53.20 I'm so close I got it a hundred percent I got it perfect I nailed it perfect

00:59:01.07 I didn't miss anything Geoff's done it I think with that

00:59:05.20 no no but here here's some discrepancy in Geoff's

00:59:09.07 drawing the sushi container was by the fridge that's where I where the sushi

00:59:14.04 okay fine I I bet there's been a sushi container there at some point though

00:59:18.03 no I don't know about that we neither of us got the chest of drawers

00:59:21.12 no I didn't do that I forgot about that where are all the pillows

00:59:25.20 I feel like I've been lied to oh no the pillows okay so the pillows are

00:59:30.22 behind the bed at this point I think oh that was a guess dude that was a total

00:59:36.06 guess you've nailed that I can't believe it I don't

00:59:40.10 where's the mini fridge am I missing it uh it is the sauce container

00:59:45.03 oh so I got that right too it's under the oh my [ __ ] god

00:59:49.19 mm-hmm yeah I think well I think we both got the fridge position did we

00:59:54.18 you but well gavin's is more correct I'd say

00:59:58.08 as far as the fridge position but your door is off

01:00:01.12 my window behind the bed is off yeah I know that

01:00:05.09 definitely there's no Canadian flag like I was hoping

01:00:09.12 no you know what this means this means I speak

01:00:13.03 full patent I'm fully fluent in Andrew I mean like I'm like the Andrew

01:00:16.04 whisperer I can't believe I got it so close well I think it comes down to his

01:00:21.11 description I think was very good it was you got it very close too Gavin

01:00:25.02 you really did I mean Andrew is good at summarizing

01:00:28.00 instructions because I mean even with the guy looking up the description when

01:00:32.02 you listen to it was actually very good you called me ridiculous for saying all

01:00:36.07 doors at the top they're all at the top I don't know what you want from me

01:00:39.18 because you got to throw a line top wall there's no you don't walk into

01:00:43.05 a room and be like ah stick that picture on the top wall if you look at

01:00:46.16 this diagram though you would say the top is where I said it was

01:00:49.20 if you cut it down the middle I'd say the back you think that's the back you

01:00:53.18 think the front wall is the back you think you enter from the back of the room

01:00:58.08 well we've drawn the whole thing upside down haven't we

01:01:01.02 we're we're already we're orientating it on your body

01:01:04.07 at your desk would you call your bedroom door the back door

01:01:08.17 there's no way it's the back door well no yeah I'd enter in the front

01:01:12.12 and yeah whatever I'm looking at is the fact but none of it's the top is what

01:01:15.14 I'm saying the ceiling's the top sure that's fair I was just trying to

01:01:20.13 stick with the words used for the the face drawing

01:01:24.12 and I think under that criteria I was completely accurate in my

01:01:28.23 look tale of where the doors are they're so similar we can criticize your words

01:01:32.20 all day long Andrew but those words put Gavin and I

01:01:35.21 very close to each other in our design and very close to the actual room

01:01:39.16 so all criticism aside it worked you know I think that saying it's the top of

01:01:43.03 the room was [ __ I stupid too but it it worked

01:01:46.06 I gotta watch the video again I'll go see like how big the bed is

01:01:51.03 oh yeah it's a big it wasn't there's so much to take in I'm gonna

01:01:54.20 have to watch this frame by frame later yeah there's so much to learn about that

01:01:59.07 some clothes what is that picture what's that picture it really is mostly a bed

01:02:04.20 Geoff's why is there a step up into that door oh that's a question

01:02:09.22 oh it's a it's a patio it goes to your head yeah

01:02:17.06 because that door is at the top

01:02:22.15 there's some paper towels and a shoe oh there's so much to take in here there's

01:02:27.11 one shoe and a there's some kitchen roll oh that is one

01:02:31.01 shoe what kind of where's the other shoe uh it's

01:02:34.04 uh it's near the desk I think I don't know why it's in that corner

01:02:38.12 what's in the yellow bowl what is in the that's a good question

01:02:41.16 I'll see I'll check are those the same headphones you use in the bathtub

01:02:45.02 uh the ones on the bed yes those are the bad boys I'll be right back

01:02:48.23 what's that big picture next to the closet yeah that's what I'm wearing

01:02:52.10 some shoes oh it is it's an x-ray of shoes

01:02:55.05 what is it it's just two bottles in the bowl it's not that exciting of a bowl

01:02:58.17 okay what's what's on the picture the the shoe which picture

01:03:02.03 which looks like a shoe x-ray between the hot dog and the [ __ ] room

01:03:05.11 that was somebody uh in the community made that and uh they sold it so I

01:03:08.19 bought it but what is it what is it we can't quite

01:03:11.20 make it out it's like it's like two things of converse shoes

01:03:16.17 oh okay yeah it's not it's I mean it's just it's pretty normal

01:03:19.16 it's uh the halo 3 legendary yeah I do I'm still hanging out with that

01:03:24.05 see ya see inside the hot dog closet just a little bit I'm surprised nobody's

01:03:29.01 pointing out my super cool Sahara framed

01:03:32.04 what is that what I don't know what that is it's uh it's from the movie Sahara

01:03:36.12 with everyone's favorite yep everyone's favorite action movie was it like a real

01:03:40.14 film cell like what is in there no it's it's the two coins that it's

01:03:44.13 like they're chasing after these coins and they're two coins for the movie that

01:03:48.04 they put into a thing it was given to me as a birthday gift

01:03:51.06 when I was younger I might be the only person with Sahara merchandise on their

01:03:54.23 wall not exactly the biggest of movies can I

01:03:57.18 be honest with you the island cabinet I started to watch that movie when it

01:04:01.18 came out and I [ __ ] left oh it's not bad it's not that bad yeah

01:04:06.12 green Wilson in it Steve zan zhan I think the bed is the most

01:04:09.19 confusing it looks like you have a tiny duvet and it's scrunched

01:04:14.04 up to become a pillow where's the rest of the bed stuff

01:04:17.06 uh part of it is on the floor do you just sleep in a ball with

01:04:21.16 everything just curl what's going on there well no it's just you know as

01:04:26.12 we we were recording these earlier than we normally do I just kind of got out of

01:04:30.13 bed and kind of threw everything together

01:04:33.12 totally hey hey I have no criticism here bud I think it looks fine

01:04:37.18 I love that bit I think I can't wait for people to see our

01:04:42.10 diagrams I'm excited to see people's diagrams

01:04:44.12 I also love that we we both put similar effort into it but

01:04:48.12 they both have their their own distinct feels

01:04:52.06 like I love that you used black white and blue within the yellow Andrew it's

01:04:56.04 like such it's so it's striking honestly and I was trying

01:04:59.08 to do something similar in a notepad like writing it down on paper and I just I

01:05:03.11 couldn't do it justice which is why I switched [Laughter]

01:05:08.02 yeah dude what a segment oh we know Andrew way better than we

01:05:12.12 thought we did Gavin yeah I think I can I would be able to

01:05:16.05 translate Andrew into English to other people I think

01:05:19.14 I think I think I just speak English based on the fact you both got it and

01:05:24.06 I think we'll see we'll see with other people's drawings like once again when

01:05:27.21 we did the face thing Geoff [ __ ] did terrible and all of his friends

01:05:31.04 everyone else in the community nailed it so I think yeah do you think people

01:05:35.22 have people in the community do you think they'll draw

01:05:38.13 the rooms before they see our diagrams because maybe

01:05:41.21 oh definitely because we we asked at the end of last episode to do that with the

01:05:45.12 engineers so yeah I'll be great we'll come with

01:05:48.17 that one I think people are gonna nail this

01:05:50.13 I do too I do too I bet we'll put like a thousand images up on the Instagram

01:05:54.20 it's weird because the way Andrew describes stuff a lot of the time when

01:05:57.17 you first hear it it's like what how is that possible and then you

01:06:02.00 see the video and it's like that's exactly what it is

01:06:04.11 exactly what it is I describe it as this

01:06:06.12 I mean there's no keyboard in the in the video but

01:06:09.12 that is on a different bed I moved it to a different bed because I don't have a

01:06:14.04 stand that is a bed that is not that unused

01:06:19.03 so if we come to stay we'll have to make room for the keyboard

01:06:23.11 yeah you'd have in the guest in the guest room you'll have to move the

01:06:26.19 keyboard off the bed let's here's what we'll do gav we can

01:06:29.22 share a bed we've done that before we'll put the keyboard in between us to keep

01:06:33.05 us honest yeah yeah can we do that when we come to stay

01:06:35.16 Andrew can we sleep on either side of the keyboard oh

01:06:39.14 you are welcome to sleep on either side I would love to do it

01:06:44.18 from all of us inside your bedroom oh we've got to do it next next bathtub race

01:06:50.10 yes next bathtub race and obviously we've got to give ourselves an hour and

01:06:54.12 a half to find the place oh right right yeah they'll be that race too

01:06:59.22 oh all right we're all done this that was a jam-packed [ __ ] episode

01:07:04.10 I'm afraid uh I'm afraid for next episode yeah

01:07:07.07 we'll we'll we'll have stuff uh yeah or we won't

01:07:10.02 yeah no I think we'll be great I think you have put a lot of pressure on us

01:07:13.01 with the this episode will suck I think it uh unless was that a reverse jinx

01:07:18.07 I didn't say this episode was gonna suck

01:07:20.19 I think this episode's great oh what was the whole thing at the beginning about

01:07:24.10 the last episode did really well so this one is oh

01:07:26.21 like karmically yeah this one this one just because the last one did well yeah

01:07:30.23 but no I won't because of the content it'll because of the universe

01:07:34.05 Eric she's mad anyone else oh man I have meetings after this so like

01:07:38.19 eric's angry yep eric's angry let's let's wrap up thanks

01:07:42.17 for listening to another episode of face uh and congratulations we all now
