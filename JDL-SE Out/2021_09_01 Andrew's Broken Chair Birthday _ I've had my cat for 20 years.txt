00:01:53.06 birthday what are you doing for your birthday what's on the agenda well I'm

00:01:56.22 uh I'm using a new setup is I'd say the the highlight of my birthday unrelated

00:02:02.08 to the technical no no I did not

00:02:05.20 so yesterday why he got a new fire extinguisher I did

00:02:09.22 yeah it's my favorite thing uh yesterday my chair broke I've been using a

00:02:16.10 broken desk chair since before this podcast started

00:02:20.11 and my dream was that it would break while we were recording that was the goal

00:02:25.14 I just been waiting and uh yesterday I dropped something and I I went I bent

00:02:30.15 down to pick it up while the chair and the chairs broke finally it was the end

00:02:35.12 dump on the floor you don't have the best luck with chairs no I don't I got

00:02:41.01 great chair luck in the worst way uh it broke

00:02:43.12 I don't have uh I owned three chairs and

00:02:47.05 none of them would work for this what do

00:02:50.00 you mean I have my desk chair and then I have these two big like lazy boy type

00:02:53.23 chairs on a different level that I couldn't bring up so I don't have a

00:02:58.13 chair for this was uh the great dilemma so I've had to rewire my setup

00:03:03.22 and unrelated to my issues but it's pretty great this might be a first

00:03:09.12 in the company's history I'm not sure Eric might know but uh

00:03:13.14 let me make sure I'm recording let me grab my binoculars once Christ why would

00:03:18.15 I Geoff started the company why would I yeah but you're you're the podcast if

00:03:23.02 you use more of a podcast person Geoff although Geoff's on several all right you

00:03:26.09 have the don't blame me for this company

00:03:28.21 I'm not blaming you for it I'm recording we're good uh oh okay what what are you

00:03:34.00 stood up uh no no are you outside no no I'm neither one

00:03:39.01 he's not his bed isn't he I'm very okay well the weight balance is a little bit

00:03:44.05 of an issue my keeps trying to fall over we're fine we're good

00:03:48.12 I'll uh I'll post in the discord my setup right now

00:03:52.02 if this was a tip or foam mattress you could have a glass of wine next to you

00:03:57.12 and not worry about it it's very difficult to use binoculars

00:04:00.22 and a mouse at the same time try to see my screen so your mouse I I'm guessing

00:04:06.08 you're on the bed the mouse is on the bed and you're using binoculars

00:04:11.14 look at the screen yeah cause we post photos a lot stuff I also for recording

00:04:17.01 I needed it here this is my setup right now this is what I got going [Laughter]

00:04:22.19 I didn't have a chair so it's like what what what should I do and then I made

00:04:27.12 the great discovery that my cables are long enough that I can reach they can

00:04:31.20 reach my bed like absolutely eight pillows now maybe eight pillows yeah

00:04:35.15 well you need a lot you need the back support for I'm I'm sitting up on the

00:04:39.09 back yeah you don't want to be lying on your back no that'd be weird it'd be a

00:04:43.00 strange podcast setup so yeah that's that's my my life right

00:04:47.16 binoculars though binoculars I wouldn't have gone for uh well

00:04:50.18 how else am I I'm I'm a near-sighted person Gavin I I can't see the screen

00:04:55.00 well I mean I would have magnified windows probably before I wouldn't have

00:04:58.12 found binoculars is that book next to you a bible because you you prayed on it

00:05:02.14 that this would work no it is I was wow I keep going to call you Jake

00:05:07.18 I'm so sorry Geoff it's okay very insulting

00:05:10.12 uh that's a joke book from 1940 that I bought is that where you is that where

00:05:15.14 you found the Jake joke yeah that is that's all my greatest material comes

00:05:19.05 from that 1940 joke box so if we're any any dead air any paws in the action just

00:05:24.11 let me know I guess I'd be aware but you could find a morally questionable joke

00:05:29.13 oh there's some bangers in that book pick here let's do one pick a pick a

00:05:34.09 page one between one and like 969

00:05:38.10 okay 69 I'm holding the book upside down good start

00:05:42.19 69 okay it looks like we are in what is the chapter

00:05:47.14 the American scene okay now pick a number between 685 and 6.95

00:05:53.22 691

00:05:57.11 okay I'm just going to read this and if it's problematic or racist in any way we

00:06:02.16 could edit it a doctor who was called to a small country town to extract an

00:06:07.15 appendix missed the last train back stayed overnight in a miserable hotel

00:06:13.05 and was waiting on at breakfast by a sallow and could sallow salo salad

00:06:17.21 salo sallow and cadaver cadaver cadaverous salon cadaverous

00:06:23.02 country girl said [ __ ]

00:06:26.00 boiled tongue stewed kidneys fried liver said he

00:06:30.05 hang your symptoms bring me something to eat

00:06:34.11 uh it needs to work on the delivery but yeah well you know I haven't read it

00:06:39.06 before she offered him uh essentially a bunch of oh fall and he took that as to

00:06:43.23 be her symptoms of the if you think it's

00:06:45.21 a delivery issue let me just do it again for you is that how you pronounce awful

00:06:49.19 isn't it is that how you say awful or fall I don't know I don't know okay

00:06:58.10 yeah I it's one of those words I read don't

00:07:01.12 say it not say okay here's another great

00:07:05.03 joke quick one I'll nail the delivery on

00:07:07.20 this one not you pick the very wordy one someday we hope to see a waiter with

00:07:11.12 enough of what it takes to lay the check face up on the table great joke nailed

00:07:18.13 so I got a thousand pages of that if we ever need them well we're set we're

00:07:24.08 covered I'm no longer worried about dead end no I got it

00:07:28.12 I will fumble my way through so many jokes hey let's do one more in honor of

00:07:34.13 your birthday let's do page 27. Page 27

00:07:37.22 okay Jesus 27.

00:07:39.07 I really I put the we're still in the American scene which is very fitting for

00:07:43.16 me Jesus we're gonna go with the shortest joke on this [ __ ] thing

00:07:47.18 because there's a bunch that are like a paragraph long bell

00:07:52.06 if I were you Percy I should tell him just what I think of him Percy how can I

00:07:57.04 that I don't I'm scared to say that I don't know what that means

00:08:02.08 I know what that means another banger I'm not gonna say it I

00:08:06.08 don't know what that means that's dangerous what's a cad

00:08:10.23 what's a cat like cad c-a-d uh just like a rap scallion rambling

00:08:16.07 okay like like a cad like yeah oh yeah that's not it's not bad it's not racist

00:08:20.11 or anything okay great it was a cad that's the word I was

00:08:24.07 afraid to say okay that's my setup and that's why I'm late because I didn't

00:08:29.01 realize I couldn't see that anyone had joined the call

00:08:31.20 and wait was that the joke yeah that was

00:08:35.09 the joke that was it great joke what was the joke what happened

00:08:39.17 I tried it again

00:08:43.16 this is standard for these jokes it's often you're left with wondering where

00:08:48.21 the joke was uh sort of the magic of this book bell

00:08:52.22 if I were you Percy I should tell him just what I think of him Percy how can I

00:08:58.12 the cat has no telephone that's the that's the joke I don't know if you

00:09:02.07 missed part of it before oh I thought it ended with just you

00:09:05.19 saying the cat no that was the thing I was scared to proceed past and then I

00:09:09.18 couldn't remember I think what followed that so maybe it was my fault still

00:09:14.15 great joke [Laughter]

00:09:18.08 happy birthday to me uh so what what are you what are your

00:09:23.09 goals for this year of your life well that's a load that what a [ __ ]

00:09:28.20 what who asked that on a birthday that's uh that's a good thing that's a good

00:09:32.06 point you know what my birthday present to you I'm gonna unask that question

00:09:36.10 that's great happy birthday thank you I text you

00:09:39.13 happy birthday you didn't reply no because I was trying to assemble all

00:09:42.17 this stuff I apologize I saw it I was like I want to get to this but I need I

00:09:45.19 mean it doesn't need a response I was just making sure you saw well if it

00:09:48.20 didn't need a response why acknowledge the fact I didn't reply you know what

00:09:52.08 it's about the president's statement I'll take that comment back happy birthday

00:09:57.05 you potentially cost people a lot of money Gavin by the way I saw somebody

00:10:02.08 comment that they followed your roulette call and they lost I'm curious how many

00:10:08.06 people have copied that black black can't lose forever

00:10:12.17 no but the amount like I wonder how many people have done that and what the win

00:10:18.17 percentage is I bet it's astronomically low

00:10:21.08 no you've got to be with me in person I think that's how it works okay well

00:10:25.10 we'll test that one day I can't wait to lose everything in front of you and then

00:10:28.23 see what you have to say about it I feel like you would rather lose just so I

00:10:33.14 have to come up with a reason oh absolutely you know I'd feel bad and be

00:10:39.05 uncomfortable yeah totally that would be the dream you guys will be

00:10:43.18 happy to know that I purchased this morning a tiny roulette wheel like a

00:10:48.08 fisher-price roulette wheel set up for the face breaks so so that we can test

00:10:52.20 out this real these roulette theories I love it it's already in the mail on the

00:10:56.06 way [Laughter]

00:10:57.18 I even told I told Gavin about it last night and then I remembered that I

00:11:01.05 hadn't bought it yet so I bought it this morning when I woke up that's amazing I

00:11:05.03 woke up this morning and I was struggling to remember if something

00:11:08.10 if a conversation I had was a dream or not Andrew did we have a conversation

00:11:12.10 recently that ended up with you saying aaa batteries are a non-standard size uh

00:11:17.11 I just yeah well I I was saying that that

00:11:20.21 they're a rare battery than a double-a I think that was on the podcast wasn't it

00:11:25.14 ah it was either on the podcast or after one of the two okay I just don't I just

00:11:30.05 feel like that's pretty standard like if you're in a place that sells double a

00:11:33.09 you probably got triple a not far absolutely I like it it's like totally a

00:11:36.17 battery or something I completely agree with that my point was more in the house

00:11:40.00 I don't feel like I feel like it's more likely people have double ice like

00:11:43.06 that's if you're gonna have batteries at

00:11:45.16 your house you're gonna have double this in my experience there are more uh

00:11:49.05 pieces of equipment on earth that require double a than aaa probably

00:11:52.09 absolutely that was my point not that like you [ __ ] had to go on a treasure

00:11:56.08 hunt to find a triple a battery oh just that they weren't is popular of a usage

00:12:01.14 as opposed to the double the king of batteries I'd say

00:12:05.16 I I also just before we get too far from this I I need to make a sincere from

00:12:10.05 what from the beginning of the show I have an order

00:12:13.08 honestly that that statement only makes sense because of my notes I have this

00:12:18.08 note at the beginning we can't expand too far past it I need

00:12:23.07 to make a sincere apology to you Geoff I I I'll also [ __ ] both of you but also

00:12:29.03 apology okay so what's the order I'm going to first say

00:12:32.15 no I don't need to I'm going to like you my my kindness my birthday gift back my

00:12:38.12 advanced birthday gift is retracting that statement just an apology to Geoff

00:12:43.12 last week okay when we recorded you had an issue with the comment

00:12:47.18 leavers you were like ah people criticizing putting tot in the

00:12:52.02 recipe that's unfair you wanted a clarification of that

00:12:56.03 yeah and I was listening to I was like ah you know what like whatever I mean

00:12:59.12 it's sort of a strange thing to like care about them doing that there are so

00:13:03.15 many [ __ ] people that think they understand how ramen works they got no

00:13:08.02 [ __ ] idea I'm so sick of this I'm so sick of these

00:13:11.22 why didn't he read the instructions I'm the biggest [ __ ] instruction guy on

00:13:17.14 this podcast love instructions I follow them to a t

00:13:23.01 I look at all the instructions always people are just coming out left and right

00:13:29.09 why didn't he read the instructions you [ __ ] idiots I did read the

00:13:34.06 instructions I dug up the instructions I'm going to

00:13:38.05 post them in the chat I've got to use my binoculars one second okay okay

00:13:45.05 he's bird watching I got it there's the recipe noodle and condiments

00:13:51.07 in the bowl pour one and a half cups of boiling water

00:13:55.07 cover the bowl for three minutes yeah I mean that's how you would cook

00:13:59.20 the pork that's the package ramen that's

00:14:02.06 for packaged ramen where does it say put the ramen in the [ __ ] pot it says the

00:14:07.00 opposite well that's not ramen then it's like that's like a special type no it's

00:14:11.19 not I went to the store I bought ramen in a bag

00:14:15.14 what do you want from me post a picture of the ramen okay the whole packet well

00:14:19.15 [ __ ] I didn't expect this question I gotta get the goddamn binoculars out

00:14:25.06 we're going to another tab I think [Laughter]

00:14:32.06 we find this god damn [ __ ] this isn't ramen.

00:14:38.13 I retract my previous my statement [ __ ]

00:14:41.20 you I am I'm short-sighted Gavin I get the fact that you can't see your monitor

00:14:48.00 from across the room there is there are easier ways

00:14:51.12 I don't know how to get a packet of ramen I'm not saying I bet here's the

00:14:57.01 thing someone sent ramen instructions that showed that

00:15:01.01 and that's fair to like I get it but don't act like I don't [ __ ] read the

00:15:04.05 instructions I read the instructions I don't think you follow instructions to

00:15:09.18 a tea I think you follow them to a tea kettle

00:15:12.23 wow that was a guy see what you did there do you also in a 1940 joke book

00:15:17.23 put that in the book page 1000. What I was going to say before Gavin dumped

00:15:22.23 that on us is uh apology accepted Andrew apology accepted

00:15:26.15 the comment leavers can be frustrated when they misconstrue things I

00:15:31.01 understand and I want you to know you got my support buddy as always I just I

00:15:36.00 um love them appreciate the comment leader levers a lot

00:15:40.12 uh wait is there a difference between short I got the binoculars still up

00:15:45.05 short sighted near they're the same aren't they

00:15:47.16 just different phrasings they sound like they're the opposite

00:15:50.20 shorts I think I think shortsighted has nothing to do with your eye with your

00:15:54.19 vision dude I think nearsighted does or farsighted I

00:15:58.17 think short-sighted means you can't see you can't envision things happening far

00:16:03.18 out into the future no that's honestly that's that was a dilemma before when I

00:16:07.02 was thinking about it I was like I'm aware of that definition but I couldn't

00:16:10.07 think of anything else to describe I would definitely say you're

00:16:15.05 short-sighted yeah yeah actually correct is this ramen Gavin

00:16:19.15 is this [ __ ] ramen is this appropriate does this check out for you

00:16:25.01 is that [ __ ] ramen is that romney enough that looks like ramen looks

00:16:30.02 pretty romney I think it's wrong I went to the grocery store I bought it

00:16:33.15 I followed the instructions oh so okay that's all I wanted to say apology to

00:16:38.02 Geoff and also people have no [ __ ]

00:16:40.01 idea that there are other ways to make ramen I'm following the instructions

00:16:44.12 don't be mad at me be mad at mama be mad at the mama company if you're gonna be

00:16:48.12 mad at somebody while we're while we're issuing uh statements

00:16:52.13 I would like to jump in just because I don't think Gavin or maybe Gavin was

00:16:56.00 here for but Andrew definitely wasn't we

00:16:58.21 discovered right before the show started that I'm not

00:17:02.13 listen all right I'm stupid a lot but I'm not totally stupid when it comes to

00:17:06.07 playing [ __ ] into my f like when jack

00:17:08.07 called playing [ __ ] under the microphone

00:17:10.03 we found out today that I had something called noise suppression selected which

00:17:14.12 wouldn't let any of anything be heard and then we fixed it and now I can play

00:17:18.08 stuff to you guys that's exciting so it's not that I don't know where the

00:17:22.01 microphone on my phone is when I hold it up to the microph when I hold it up to

00:17:25.12 the microphone to record I know where the microphone on my phone is it's just

00:17:28.14 that noise suppression was canceling it out speaker whatever yeah let's just

00:17:32.00 let's just do that again it's not that I don't know where the speaker is on my

00:17:35.00 phone I know exactly where it is and when I put it up to the thing I don't

00:17:38.10 know why it doesn't play for you guys but now it will because we tested it and

00:17:41.12 it worked am I smarter than if I already having it off yes okay but your

00:17:46.19 intelligence was never in question [Laughter]

00:17:50.17 what's weird is I never viewed it as like you

00:17:54.00 I don't know it wasn't a dumb thing this is gonna sound strange I didn't really

00:17:59.05 because I'm pretty sure it was with nick and Eric today

00:18:02.04 I viewed it until we figured it out the same I just viewed it as you didn't know

00:18:06.08 how which is maybe more insulting I don't know what is more insulting but it

00:18:09.14 just seemed like a thing you were just bad at it it was like somehow yeah I'm

00:18:13.02 not though I'm not though it was just a setting and we fixed it thanks to nick

00:18:17.12 hey good job nick we did it hey well Andrew is there anything this is

00:18:22.21 your birthday man it's not even like your birthday episode it's today is

00:25:06.19 well let's see I can I can try it let's just let's just see what happens

00:25:11.20 well it lists it as 225 and says latest arrival by 310. Okay 225 so that would

00:25:18.12 be what time is it now one thing it should be 1.41

00:25:25.01 but according to this I placed the order at 225. This country's too wide

00:25:31.14 well this it's not yeah we should do something about it but we're not we're

00:25:35.01 not in our country at all right now we're talking about history

00:25:40.08 I mean the width this country's too wide this is a different country

00:25:47.14 oh Christ does it have the same number of

00:25:51.07 time zones I don't know like does Canada have mountain time Canada time zones

00:25:56.17 there's six time zones in Canada apparently oh they probably got one on like

00:26:02.14 nova scotia or something yeah it says central standard time in Canada it's 2

00:26:08.00 42 p.m right now yeah but he's not central we're central daylight time he's

00:26:13.16 like way west no I think he is though because it's set well it does say

00:26:18.13 Vancouver it's 142 but it also says it also says mountain daylight time and

00:26:23.16 central standard time are both 242 and then

00:26:25.22 central daylight time is 342. This is stupid [Laughter]

00:26:29.12 how are you gonna have two different time zones under the same [ __ ] time

00:26:34.12 why do you have to why are they two different time zones then that's so dumb

00:26:39.03 well they could be different depending on time of year like daylight savings

00:26:44.06 yeah I guess how far away is his outside this is crazy I'm back

00:26:48.17 oh here we go we were just bitching about time zones how you doing buddy

00:26:53.18 happy birthday happy birthday did you get your stuff I got the bag

00:26:57.03 yeah oh sweet I tried to get you a birthday cake but I couldn't find

00:26:59.23 anybody that had a cake that could deliver it this quickly so I just got

00:27:03.12 you an assortment of things you were gone for like 10 minutes yeah I had to

00:27:07.17 go around the building and find the guy that's on my bare feet let's make sure

00:27:13.20 not to step on anything this is a whole load yeah I had to get out of the

00:27:19.07 [ __ ] wire nest that I assembled not thinking I'd move

00:27:23.22 oh I gotta eat what is this hey Brandon thank you Andrew what time zone are you

00:27:29.00 in I'm in pacific standard time I believe bst that's not even listed

00:27:33.21 pacific daylight time you mean pacific standard time is also I think for sure

00:27:37.22 okay what's it called in Canada I believe pacific standard time oh

00:27:42.13 am I missing something what what's [ __ ] going on I feel like I left you

00:27:45.19 guys laid out a bunch of goddamn booby traps and I'm coming back it's my

00:27:49.03 birthday what is happening I think the difference is pacific

00:27:53.01 standard time is a certain time of the year and then when the like you leap

00:27:56.21 forward or leap back it switches to pacific daylight time I think it depends

00:27:59.19 on the time of the year whether it's daylight or standard I think I think

00:28:03.10 that's stupid is there what is what I'm going to find out what is the difference

00:28:08.10 Andrew do you want to cover uh what you wanted to talk about today um well first

00:28:12.21 we need to watch this video we need to watch the don zimmer fight oh yeah we

00:28:17.22 gotta watch coffee what is this did you say it was 140 in this one oh I got you

00:28:21.13 a I got you an earl grey tea a warm tea just in case you got 30. What is why is

00:28:39.02 fight he's storming out there he's walking out

00:28:43.05 he's storming out he's got things to say oh he's gonna talk to the umpire he is

00:28:47.05 he just got thrown out of the game I believe moving a lot slower back then

00:28:50.21 than he did in his later years he's trying to be intimidating he said 140

00:28:56.23 140 well we're way past that now all right helmet helmet is off

00:28:59.23 umpire off they're going back and forth they're talking oh arms are flying yep

00:29:05.03 that's the first aggression move he's pointing to to outside

00:29:08.11 disagreeing back and forth the points have begun

00:29:14.06 that is the non-physical punch they're just throwing

00:29:17.20 back and forth zimmer hands in the air for a second time he's letting him know

00:29:23.12 he's doing the walk back arms throw now he's kicking dirt he's comboing the arms

00:29:27.21 throw with the dirt kick he's so fast his arms are like bullets are you ready

00:29:32.05 for the finishing move Gavin finish a move about to come up

00:29:36.10 hands on the hip he's like listen I'm a man of reason I'm listening to you

00:29:40.09 do another arm throw the umpire doesn't have much to say he's just staring he

00:29:43.20 doesn't know what to say the zim is going full on him you can see his vein

00:29:49.01 popping out oh arms out hands up rolling the sleeves up now the umpire's

00:29:53.16 back trying now the um

00:30:00.13 you cannot counter when the guy takes a hat off

00:30:04.00 oh god it's like two birds I try to fly over a nut that was so fast and weird

00:30:14.04 that man is my hero he's great oh my god thank you for bringing that

00:30:18.21 into my life oh my god and I'm Andrew I didn't even

00:30:22.06 show you hold on a second Geoff what what were you doing in 19891989 last

00:30:28.08 one that what video is from uh I was 14 I was in uh

00:30:35.01 ninth grade I was in high school freshman in high school I was probably

00:30:38.16 watching that game [Laughter]

00:30:41.09 I was a huge baseball fan in 1999 a huge huge cubs fan huge don zimmer fan uh

00:30:46.15 there was like there were like three shows there were like three channels on

00:30:50.07 tv that played baseball wtbs wgn and I don't know some other channel and so I

00:30:55.01 watched every white sox and cubs game that was on tv because it was all I had

00:30:58.12 the choi and the braves that's all that was available to me so I probably saw

00:31:01.18 that game when it happened or maybe not I don't know they have the

00:31:05.01 summer of zimmer or the zimmer boy something like that it's like a vhs

00:31:08.22 chronicling a championship season they had it's on YouTube we should watch that

00:31:13.04 at some point I think that'd be fun well just watch it together I think you

00:31:16.17 should it's like an hour long look at this [ __ ] awesome shirt that

00:31:20.17 I'm wearing

00:31:23.01 see that is that that is that era of don zimmer as well that's what it is

00:31:29.18 it's appropriate to the time of the video I really appreciate that your entire

00:31:35.12 wardrobe is slowly becoming conceptually I was telling Gavin I'm working on a

00:31:40.06 zimmer only wardrobe if I have uh I can get away with it I'm doing my day

00:31:44.15 amazing oh man speaking of the library um this

00:31:48.10 is a a really short brief story I could tell that's related to nick and I we had

00:31:52.17 a we had a nick and I had a little incident earlier this week oh uh in my

00:31:57.12 library where uh poor nick had nothing to do with it uh but it was his fault

00:32:01.13 he asked me to record some lines he asked me to record uh ad reads

00:32:05.19 yesterday or Monday and I was like yeah man I can do that and then I was doing

00:32:09.03 something else and then I thought you know what I'm not gonna let time get

00:32:12.12 away from me I'm gonna run over I'm gonna do nick's ad reads right now even

00:32:15.15 though I have something else going on but I was like I just want to get them

00:32:19.01 out of the way so I run into my room and I start to do them and I set it up and

00:32:22.14 uh as right as I'm starting to record I I realize that I can hear Millie

00:32:26.03 watching grey's anatomy or some [ __ ] in

00:32:28.02 her room and so I went like oh I should probably shut the door so I get up to

00:32:32.17 shut the little saloon doors that you know shut my uh my library off from the

00:32:37.22 rest of the house and somehow opening the the one door just opening the door

00:32:43.18 it I'll never for as long as I live understand how

00:32:46.14 this happened and I wish I could go back and

00:32:50.06 study it like the brooder film because it's phenomenal

00:32:52.20 I I just opened the door that wasn't touching or connected it wasn't even

00:32:55.21 touching the wall it was just like half open I just opened it and when I did

00:32:59.15 that this giant picture of jean-Paul sartre hanging on my wall fell down and

00:33:04.10 when it fell down you know how my wall has I didn't tell you this part nick

00:33:08.12 this I found this out later my wall has horizontal like wooden beams across it

00:33:13.20 it ripped one of the beams off my wall and it then hit my doorknob and it shot

00:33:18.16 my doorknob across the room and ripped the doorknob off my door and left a

00:33:23.07 giant hole the picture frame got broken the picture

00:33:26.23 inside the frame got [ __ ] up the wall got broken and I lost a doorknob all

00:33:32.20 because nick asked me to do lines.

00:33:36.02 I was telling him about it I was telling

00:33:38.17 him about it as I was recording I'm like nick you're not going to believe what's

00:33:42.00 happening right now in this room and uh and then after I I finished I

00:33:45.14 found out it was way worse unbelievable blown away the doorknob

00:33:47.05 flew off I'm not you know what I'm going to take I'm going to show you a picture

00:33:50.08 of it hold on I'm going to go find hold on a second

00:33:55.03 have you ever lost a doorknob Gavin no you know what I I've not owned a lot of

00:34:00.23 doorknobs I'm more of a handle guy doorknob yeah as opposed to I don't

00:34:06.06 think I've ever bought a doorknob [Laughter]

00:34:09.12 plenty of handles you've bought a lot of handles well more

00:34:13.09 than doorknobs yeah I'm trying to think of like what are you buying

00:34:18.04 why are you buying loose handles well I like swapped I got a set that had like a

00:34:22.20 lock on it I was younger oh you wanted privacy I wanted a lock on the door so I

00:34:27.06 bought one I installed it that's the only time I think I've ever bought a

00:34:30.15 handle though trying to think there's not a time where

00:34:34.19 I bought a doorknob I had a friend I had a bet that doorknob [Laughter]

00:34:42.00 doesn't get any more doorknob than that no what if you got locked in because of

00:34:48.00 that

00:34:50.23 that would have been even funnier there's another door in the room but

00:34:54.19 yeah you've got a spare door you've got a hot swap door yeah I got a back door

00:34:59.16 that goes yeah so I just I just have a [ __ ]

00:35:02.18 hole in my door now where that was I guess it was just covering up some some

00:35:06.23 shoddy craftsmanship by the flipped house [ __ ] it I'll take a picture of

00:35:10.13 that you guys keep talking I'm gonna show you this other [ __ ] awesome

00:35:11.14 thing hold on.

00:35:19.09 I need more knobs in my life instead of handles though because I think a

00:35:24.21 doorknob is harder for a cat to operate cause they're pretty damn good at

00:35:28.12 handles are they you just gotta I don't know my

00:35:31.11 cat is old to the point where it's not it's not an issue I don't think I knew

00:35:35.18 you had a cat I don't know anything about you I've had

00:35:40.10 I've had my cat for 20 years

00:35:43.14 she's 20 years old

00:35:51.16 this isn't a new addition to my life we were discussing

00:35:56.23 we were discussing at dinner last night how little Gavin knows about you Andrew

00:36:03.05 I was filling them in I was like how do you not know these basic things about

00:36:06.20 Andrew I just feel like I don't ask a lot of personal questions I ask a lot of

00:36:11.21 questions that make you sound like an insane person like how you make food and

00:36:16.15 [ __ ] but not not about your family or your living

00:36:20.04 it's the doorknob again I really sent the damn doorknob hold on

00:36:27.01 you got a cat when you were seven yeah it's still around it's still around

00:36:32.06 sam is still around but she's very old she doesn't she doesn't jump that much

00:36:38.04 also not the greatest with vision yeah I've had to say in my whole life great

00:36:43.11 and I've no I've known you online for 2007

00:36:46.10 so like 13 years yeah around then here's the problem with us Gavin I'm

00:36:51.09 somebody who doesn't just like share personal information or like that type

00:36:56.00 of thing and you never ask so there's just I don't want to intrude I feel like

00:36:59.09 you'll tell me [ __ ] well I feel the same

00:37:01.18 way I feel like why would anyone want to know so I just don't

00:37:05.20 I don't talk about it so you and I great friendship and if we

00:37:09.13 could talk for literally years every day

00:37:11.12 and I don't think we'd ever like enter a

00:37:13.15 personal we're like a friendship without any foundation like it's built on

00:37:18.22 nothing oh there's the hole yeah [Music]

00:37:22.13 wait that's what was on the that's what was behind my doorknob

00:37:27.07 dude no wonder it flew off how did you not just pull it off when

00:37:31.14 you used the handle I don't know man never came up never happened

00:37:36.00 looks like somebody shot your door it's great

00:37:42.10 oh home ownership so wait how does how does Geoff know about your personal life

00:37:48.16 did he ask I don't know that's a great question well I've known I've known

00:37:54.00 Andrew for oh I don't know over a decade and uh I've had a million conversations

00:37:58.20 I know the [ __ ] about your personal life too Gavin I a I listen and b I I

00:38:03.18 remember and see I asked questions yeah I know

00:38:07.03 stuff about your life it's equal yeah because you've asked me questions I

00:38:10.05 don't know why you refuse to ask answering questions

00:38:14.17 you've also lived together so I feel like that's an additional layer like

00:38:20.00 it's just you don't what if what if we lived together for six months Audrey

00:38:23.23 what would uh that'd be I don't know that'd be interesting you wouldn't want

00:38:27.12 to be roommates for six months no I would be totally fine with that that'd

00:38:31.12 be great I think we'd get a lot more doorknobs I'd have

00:38:35.03 I'd have to adjust the way I live to fit within the boundaries of your life and

00:38:38.12 your rules but I think it'll be fine I don't what do you mean I'm not a big

00:38:42.01 rule not a big one like I'd go to the kitchen and you know the waffle maker

00:38:46.05 would be in your bedroom no I would if if we were if I felt that that there

00:38:50.16 would be a community waffle maker I would not afford the supplies

00:38:54.12 I'm not like a [ __ ] mad max villain with water I it would be in the communal

00:38:58.19 area we'd all we could share I'm not going to hoard

00:39:02.12 anything okay that's good today yeah I think it would be pretty uneventful

00:39:06.13 honestly it would be like and occasionally why did we do we'd be

00:39:09.21 three months in and we'd be like if we did this for content reasons this was a

00:39:13.00 mistake because we're just we'd just be co-existing nicely we're just watching

00:39:17.04 mr bean it's just like it's a strange like nobody needs this Andrew took it

00:39:21.22 upon himself to try and watch every episode of mr bean because I made one

00:39:25.14 reference to mr bean uh two episodes ago well we talked about it that's that's a

00:39:29.19 little uh you're narrowing how much we talked about mr meanwhile I mean that's

00:39:33.05 the reason we started talking about being is because

00:39:35.08 that is true the firework yeah but then it led into an extended conversation in

00:39:39.02 which that that claim or the commitment happened have you finished being are you

00:39:43.09 although I haven't I haven't watched it since we last spoke

00:39:46.15 but I will what is your opinions thus far I think it's a really good show I

00:39:50.09 think there are times where if you don't find the bit funny they extend every

00:39:54.05 idea out to its fullest extent so if you're not immediately on board it's

00:39:58.21 like oh I got like three minutes of just this continuing gag but when it does

00:40:02.15 work it's incredible and I think it's a important show in a comedic sense of

00:40:07.06 like if you're growing up watching it man I guess I need to go back and

00:40:10.13 rewatch episodes I can't remember mr bean ever not being funny like bits not

00:40:14.01 working and stuff it's not it's just they're different

00:40:17.09 the example I gave to Gavin is there's one where he's like making a sandwich on

00:40:20.19 a bench and it's like oh he's just pulling stuff out of his jacket and I've

00:40:24.17 seen him do this before and now it's just like three minutes of like I get he

00:40:28.12 has everything in his jacket yeah he kind of does that in the first

00:40:32.10 episode with the like the pens and the pink but the pen yeah all that is great

00:40:36.20 like especially the first time I watched

00:40:38.14 it I went back and I rewatched the first episode I liked it so much but

00:40:42.12 I haven't finished the show I'm like halfway through it's okay

00:40:46.05 it's really I think if you grew up with it it would be amazing did Gavin tell

00:40:50.19 you that he met him at a grocery store once he did not

00:40:53.18 yeah well he did that's true he asked me where the uh

00:40:57.22 what was it ginger yeah that's where the ginger was sad

00:41:00.20 just one of those little facts I know about gavin's life because I've listened

00:41:06.15 to him um I have a thing I could talk to you guys about I texted you about it

00:41:12.04 left you in suspense I I texted I forgot about that till this moment yeah

00:41:20.21 let me find the text I don't remember this text oh it's it's poop related dude

00:41:26.14 I want to get into this oh oh so I I just texted Geoffy Gavin something

00:41:32.12 along the lines of I might [ __ ] myself I think you ended we we ended with you

00:41:38.01 saying if [ __ ] was an olympic event you would have just earned yourself a b

00:41:41.19 it was a bronze medal performance in like a class and where you saying bolt

00:41:45.15 is in the race like there's no way I could get a gold but it's like in a

00:41:48.23 different year that could have been a silver that could have been a gold it

00:41:53.20 was a great performance I don't as established before I think at some point

00:41:57.10 on the show I I don't [ __ ] in away games I'm a home [ __ ] I need to feel

00:42:02.13 comfortable I haven't used a public toilet in probably like 15 years or so

00:42:07.21 can I just say I looked that up to see if there is a unit of measurement for in

00:42:12.17 15-year increments and it's called an indiction so you have not [ __ ] away from

00:42:18.06 home in one indiction that is yeah what I deem to be home now

00:42:22.15 that doesn't necessarily mean my actual home like if I'm if I'm on vacation I

00:42:26.15 would make the hotel my home toilet it's just the personal it's not like ever

00:42:32.10 anyone it's just five so andrew's cat is an addiction and a

00:42:36.21 lustrum old Andrew has it [ __ ] outside of his house in three lustrums which

00:42:42.00 happens to be one indiction.

00:42:47.15 [Laughter]

00:42:51.16 So I was at go ahead what were you gonna say just laughing okay

00:42:56.19 I was at like a small gathering and I don't know what it what typically

00:43:01.16 I'm pretty good I had is this family or friends family it's a family

00:43:06.08 a family gathering okay I need to add to the list by the way

00:43:10.11 you're of a home game unverified vertical wiper I'm just putting in all the

00:43:15.20 requirements of your turds okay I'm up to date and I don't as I

00:43:20.00 established I'm a home I'm a home [ __ ] so I was like I'll just wait

00:43:24.12 I'll just wait until I get to a home toilet and I was gonna get picked up by

00:43:28.23 someone and so I was like okay I can hold it for the purpose of [ __ ] what

00:43:33.04 do you mean somebody was somebody picking you up no no no no I was going

00:43:36.02 somewhere else after the fact so I was just gonna like uh that is a place I'd

00:43:39.16 rather [ __ ] at than where I'm currently

00:43:41.10 at I think I can hold it I view this as in a way view the other one as a home

00:43:44.21 toilet so I I get there I I get in the car and they're like I

00:43:49.12 really want a burger at this place and I was like oh god this is [ __ ]

00:43:54.05 this is a problem I'm going to hold my because I almost

00:43:57.22 I'm a [ __ ] on the way to the pickup spot

00:44:00.14 but it was close you're not vocalizing yours not at all you're trying to hold

00:44:05.20 it in and just because yeah because I'm a polite individual I'm

00:44:09.12 like if I say we need to skip your burger I gotta [ __ ] I'll just be hearing

00:44:13.23 about oh man I'm so excited about that burger and I didn't get it I didn't want

00:44:18.17 to deal with that so I'm just like we're just gonna clench hard we're gonna

00:44:22.00 clench as hard as we can can I ask can I ask a question and I

00:44:26.08 apologize if you covered this and I missed it but where is this [ __ ] coming

00:44:29.17 from like did you have Indian food the night before or is this just like a

00:44:33.01 run-of-the-mill normal [ __ ] or is this like no it's just I I think it was

00:44:37.06 something I ate was just it like flared up like it was all systems go type thing

00:44:42.02 was it fiber one bars did you have a bunch of it was no it's not five or one

00:44:45.20 bars it was a I was like you know what I think I got this and then I started

00:44:50.05 walking and I was like oh I really don't I was like clinched on the walk there

00:44:55.16 I almost [ __ ]

00:44:57.22 on the path I had to stop and just stand for a minute and just Melissa McCarthy

00:45:04.09 and bridesmaids uh yeah how did you let it get this bad so

00:45:07.10 suddenly I feel like no because it was like really clenching it's like you've

00:45:11.18 been holding it in for five hours already yeah no it was it I I probably

00:45:15.16 held for an hour before I made the walk because I was I and then I left I

00:45:20.04 learned about the burger I'm like oh Jesus Christ okay well at least

00:45:24.09 at least it's like a drive-through it was a new place it was it was a triple

00:45:28.13 o's is where the burger was getting picked up from I did not realize even

00:45:32.03 though triple h has a drive-through there is a wait time so they stopped the

00:45:35.14 car and they're like I'm gonna go get the burger I'll be back so now I'm in

00:45:40.06 the car and like this is a [ __ ]

00:45:42.12 problem every time we hit a speed bump I

00:45:44.10 felt like I was gonna rock it out of the chair it was so bad are you sweating at

00:45:48.02 this point I'm not sweating but I'm I'm like trying to come to terms with the

00:45:51.15 fact of I might [ __ ] myself and what does this mean and how do I explain it

00:45:55.11 to this person it's just like how do I solve this issue are they getting a

00:45:58.23 burger for you too or just them just they asked if I wanted anything I said

00:46:03.20 absolutely not no thank you what's less polite blocking the burger or [ __ ]

00:46:07.12 in the car after the burger that's a tough measurement I was at the

00:46:11.23 point of considering do I just like find a tree

00:46:15.09 in this area I'm in a mall at this point but like there are those little like

00:46:19.01 kind of tree things in the middle of it

00:46:22.00 I'm like do I just [ __ ] at the tree and just accept that

00:46:24.13 I don't know what I'm gonna do this isn't a bad spot so then I texted you

00:46:27.17 guys I might [ __ ] myself and then I got

00:46:30.02 so close to [ __ ] I had to put all of my focus and not letting it happen I just

00:46:33.20 threw the phone to the car like in the bottom of the car I just sat there and I

00:46:38.02 was like oh [ __ ]

00:46:39.02 I had to hop out of the car I couldn't clench hard enough in the seat so now

00:46:43.18 I'm out of the car clenching and I'm like Jesus Christ the phone down because

00:46:48.18 it's potentially a lapse in concentration if you're doing something

00:46:51.13 on your phone you might think absolutely that is yeah that is the thing where

00:46:55.05 it's like I need to put I need to reroute all focus into not [ __ ] right now.

00:47:00.12 [Music]

00:47:01.19 So I'm now standing outside of the car just holding on to it clenched as hard

00:47:06.12 as I could and I it broke me at that point I was

00:47:09.11 like I'm gonna I cannot hold this anymore are you clenching with just your

00:47:13.17 ass or are you also oh I mean adding the hands is a bit of clinch no I'm going

00:47:18.02 just full ass clench right now I don't think the hands would do much outside of

00:47:22.08 like visual bizarreness I've never been into this

00:47:25.02 restaurant so I don't know if they have a public bathroom but I take the walk in

00:47:29.04 my head I'm like I'm going in there I don't know

00:47:32.02 it's because of covid some places aren't doing like the public bathrooms if this

00:47:36.06 place doesn't have a public bathroom that's just like I'm in the middle of

00:47:39.19 nowhere in no man's land and I might [ __ ] myself in this restaurant so I I

00:47:45.10 slowly shuffle in [Laughter]

00:47:48.08 I walk past the person's way for the burger I'm like I use the bathroom I

00:47:53.18 shuffle in and they have them and I'm so [ __ ] it's like if you were

00:47:58.07 dying of dehydration in the desert and you found a pond like it was the relief

00:48:04.09 it was salvation I just does like I need space I went into the family bathroom

00:48:08.09 because I didn't trust the other I'm like I'm definitely going to be good you

00:48:13.16 need the family yep went in did my business didn't like it was one of those

00:48:17.07 situations where just crouching it releases so it's like I just gotta I

00:48:21.20 hope I'm lined up on this toilet correct I hope we're not

00:48:25.18 we don't want splash damage we don't want this has to be a swish we cannot

00:48:30.17 have any off the rim and in on this scenario there's no backboard for this oh I

00:48:36.03 nailed it perfectly nothing but ceramic yeah I nailed it.

00:48:42.08 I got it it went great it went according to plan and I had like a realization in

00:48:48.11 my life that I've been making a mistake this past 15 years I've made a huge

00:48:53.06 mistake in how I've handled this I need to scout bathrooms from this

00:48:57.16 point going forward if you are if you're where if you're in

00:49:01.22 the town I live in triple o's fantastic bathroom would recommend I need to start

00:49:07.04 using like I would eat like I wouldn't even use a urinal I just hold the pea

00:49:11.12 until I got home I need to use the urinal as like my

00:49:14.14 scouting tool that's my way to get into

00:49:16.12 the bathroom not having to take a [ __ I I can make a map triple o's is kind of

00:49:20.04 like in the middle of town too so it's great no matter where I am I can kind of

00:49:23.20 get to the triple o so right now I got triple o's on my board as the number one

00:49:27.11 bathroom that I'm aware of in town that's public I I think this is a great

00:49:31.07 idea and here's what I think you should do with it you've heard of angie's list

00:49:35.01 right if you haven't it's a service that a lot

00:49:38.04 of people will pay for and you go on and you can find

00:49:41.14 uh like a contractor plumber whatever it's it's like like the old version of

00:49:46.00 thumbtack we need to start andrew's list and it's a free list it's an app any

00:49:51.22 city you go into where you we list like you rank the best public toilets for

00:49:55.12 that town Andrews list that's such a great idea boom cause it's like I I

00:50:00.06 trust myself but I don't know if other people would trust me in the ba I mean I

00:50:03.12 haven't been in a public bathroom in 15

00:50:05.14 years my standards may be low I want somebody who's in the trenches every day

00:50:10.10 updating the app where's the place to be

00:50:13.03 who the [ __ ] is Angie I don't know who that is

00:50:15.06 people still care for that [ __ ]

00:50:17.05 you're the expert if you say you are that's how I understand it anymore but

00:50:21.03 I'm saying like I want more Skype I don't trust my scouting abilities what

00:50:26.12 I'm saying you need a like a like a street team like a shite team yeah

00:50:32.17 I do so what would you rate why would you rate that one that's uh I don't

00:50:37.12 that's I'd say eight out of ten hey off 10 on Andrews list yeah lots of space it

00:50:43.07 was almost as big as my bedroom there's so much space in there I can't comment

00:50:47.08 on what the like the men's or the women's bathroom was like but the family

00:50:51.12 bathroom fantastic great toilet so thus ends an addiction thus incidentally

00:50:56.13 you're [ __ ] addiction yeah mm-hmm yeah bronze metal performance as I said

00:51:02.00 so so why did you go explain why you gave yourself bronze oh well because if

00:51:06.08 I would have made it back to the place that I was going to then that would

00:51:10.10 surely be a bronze or a gold medal you cannot do better than that that is a

00:51:14.10 flawless performance like that into the world coming back home tough [ __ ] yeah

00:51:20.04 yeah yeah if you make it to your home toilet whatever that is wherever you're

00:51:23.18 going uh that's a gold in this scenario I did not have the strength to continue

00:51:29.00 to hold hold it back I held the line as long as I could and I broke

00:51:33.20 if I would have made it I'd say you know this is this is a tough thing because

00:51:38.19 what if is this a silver medal and not you know

00:51:41.05 what I think I might this might be a silver because I was gonna say a silver

00:51:44.12 would be further distance but then I'd probably end up [ __ ] myself and I

00:51:49.12 don't feel like that should be above bronze

00:51:51.14 so I think I got a silver bronze would be if you made it and you [ __ ] yourself

00:51:56.04 like if you went 70 of the way I don't think you can [ __ ] yourself and still

00:52:00.17 get a bronze you don't think that's on the podium that's a brown

00:52:03.21 yeah that's not a podium okay no you don't podium finish if you finish it

00:52:08.02 you don't get a pony finish if you finish in your pants dude well then

00:52:11.09 what's the silver because then if we're going to a silver I'm then asking for a

00:52:15.08 pullover at a bathroom yeah I don't know

00:52:17.04 I mean I I understand what you're saying uh but I just I don't I

00:52:21.14 I don't think you can I think that silver's gotta be

00:52:24.06 somewhere in between those two locations but maybe in a ditch so it's like it's

00:52:28.04 not going in your pants but you're very close if you're getting if you're

00:52:32.06 getting wheeled off the basketball court in a wheelchair because you [ __ ] your

00:52:36.17 pants on a playoff game uh yeah you can't win a gold medal

00:52:40.19 [ __ ] out the window of the moving car that way you're not stopping you're

00:52:45.11 still going you're not [ __ ] yourself behind you well you know the thing about

00:52:50.13 that Mario kart attack I feel like I feel like the judges would give you

00:52:55.00 extra points for difficulty that is true I feel like whenever you're about to

00:52:59.03 [ __ ]

00:53:00.05 If you if you see a toilet or if you know a toilet it's in proximity it

00:53:04.19 causes you to really need to [ __ ] oh because because it's like there's the

00:53:08.17 end in sight so my question is if you'd have got to the restaurant and then just

00:53:13.11 right then with all the hope of there being a toilet found out that there

00:53:16.11 wasn't one would you have even made it out of the restaurant before [ __ ]

00:53:20.02 yourself I have no idea I mean that's such a tough call I don't know

00:53:24.12 did you know uh they say I don't want to get into like other

00:53:29.03 people's content or other people's podcasts but there's another podcast uh

00:53:33.22 that uh I listened to where one of the producers on the podcast he only shits

00:53:38.14 about every two to three weeks like once

00:53:40.07 every two or three weeks he just like he has like an aversion to [ __ ] but

00:53:43.19 when he needs to [ __ ] desperately like that he uh he will go and just sit on

00:53:48.13 the toilet and he's for like a minute and then he said like the [ __ ]

00:53:51.21 desire goes away so maybe you could try that if you're in like a non-standard

00:53:55.18 unsafe toilet maybe you could just try [ __ ] and then backwards I agree but

00:54:00.03 that's what he says that's how we get it's it's this dude on the tom segura on

00:54:03.17 a tom square podcast he says that uh yeah if he ever has to [ __ ] really bad

00:54:07.07 he feels like he's gonna do it he just sits down on the toilet for like a

00:54:10.10 minute and then the need goes away and dr drew pin sky was on and he like was

00:54:13.22 like yeah that's that's that that makes sense at the office once my chair was

00:54:17.09 hidden and replaced with a toilet and I tried to just use it as my desk chair

00:54:20.20 for a day and it just made me want to [ __ ] all day something about something

00:54:26.04 about like that your anus hanging slightly lower than it would on a normal

00:54:31.03 chair it makes you want to drop you know you know it's funny man

00:54:34.12 we've done some really funny stuff over the years I forgot we replaced your desk

00:54:39.09 your chair with a toilet once that's a funny joke

00:54:41.19 uh the lid was open nick it was uh I I didn't want to sit on top of the top

00:54:45.20 lid because it's very thin and it was gonna crack yeah now that will happen

00:54:50.10 yeah what a fascinating well what I don't understand why that would make

00:54:54.16 him not want to I have the opposite problem I would never do it I I I need I

00:54:59.11 have a colon disease I need to [ __ ] I

00:55:01.05 [ __ ] three times a day and I need to and

00:55:03.02 I if I don't feel right if I don't [ __ ]

00:55:05.09 multiple times a day so I would never try it in a million years but uh I just

00:55:09.05 I'm just repeating what they said on the show

00:55:12.00 you ever do the thing where like you go to flip the lid up and you miss and then

00:55:15.15 it just creates tension like it makes everything so much worse I've had that

00:55:18.15 several times what do you what does that mean like I need to piss badly and the

00:55:22.11 lid is down and so I gotta flip the lid up to uh to piss and I'll like I don't

00:55:27.08 throw it up hard enough or I'll throw it

00:55:30.00 too hard it'll bounce off the toilet and

00:55:31.22 go back down and I'm already in like I'm peeing mode you gotta do like a full

00:55:34.23 scar you gotta do it's like a stutter step of piss I'm a sitting guy yeah

00:55:40.12 well that's fair there's too much splash with us with a standing up piss the if

00:55:44.19 you if you just sit down every time you have to clean the toilet yes I'm the

00:55:48.18 same I'm a sitting pee guy now too well not in public but yeah at my home too

00:55:53.03 embarrassing no yeah I'm not gonna go to the movie

00:55:56.15 theater well toilets are dirty man I don't want to I assume

00:55:59.12 one of the reasons Andrew doesn't want a away game is because he doesn't want to

00:56:03.03 [ __ ] on some weird gross toilet I don't

00:56:05.11 want to touch that stuff either so yeah I will always pee in a urinal at a movie

00:56:10.06 theater or whatever but at home yeah I'ma sit down here I view the public

00:56:14.04 like let's say a mall bathroom that's just like being in a constant air strike

00:56:19.01 of [ __ ] particles like every time you hear a toilet going right back hold on a

00:56:22.12 second just just just a second I'll be right back I swear to god if this is

00:56:26.23 another delivery person and I gotta [ __ ] go out my building

00:56:30.04 I'm just not gonna get it how fast is it from like where you are to the the door

00:56:36.10 it's I mean I I have to go down several sets of stairs

00:56:39.22 and then need to walk around I need to it's far it's hey Andrew

00:58:53.10 porque diablo style spicy and Emily had uh after some internal debate and a

00:58:57.17 little bit of debate with me uh the muscles because she's like when they're

00:59:00.15 bad you know you gotta be careful with muscles and I don't know if it's the

00:59:04.06 right time to have them oh and she actually asked she is the waitress she

00:59:07.04 was like how the muscles they are they on today and she was like oh they're

00:59:10.12 outstanding today so she was like okay so then we had a lovely dinner lovely

00:59:14.14 meal uh we all went home uh it wasn't it

00:59:31.05 ceiling yeah because yeah you would about half the night was us

00:59:35.07 talking about survivor you guys are at 35 we're on 36. And uh well I woke up

00:59:39.15 this morning and uh I had to pee and Emily wasn't in bed but she has to get

00:59:43.02 up early to go to work and so I was like I didn't think anything other I walked

00:59:46.06 into my bathroom and she was laying completely naked on the bathroom floor

00:59:50.12 on the tile just going and I was like oh my god what I thought

00:59:55.11 she'd been stabbed or something and she was like I don't feel good and I was

01:00:00.14 like oh my god is it the muscles and she's like I have food poisoning and

01:00:06.13 apparently she was violently vomiting for a while I slept through the entire

01:00:11.12 thing and I didn't hear a word and then she was like I thought you heard and you

01:00:15.16 were just ignoring me because you're an [ __ ] and you don't care about me and

01:00:19.11 I was throwing up so much and you just I just never you just didn't come in to

01:00:23.01 check on me and I'm like why does he hate me I had no [ __ ] clue uh yeah so

01:00:27.05 uh good good on not getting the muscles last night yeah I would never get the

01:00:30.23 muscles for that very reason yeah I think I think it was muscles and oysters

01:00:35.09 I had that time I I was [ __ ] the plane in my bed in the shower and stuff

01:00:40.08 that's true not only so apparently when we hang out

01:00:43.03 versus if we do couples hang out right it's it's gonna be uh it could be

01:00:46.17 physically dangerous as well hello hey what's up buddy hey thanks for the ice

01:00:51.10 cream of course man you gotta wash down all those baked goods with some [ __ ]

01:00:54.18 yummy birthday ice cream they actually knew where my door was I got a variety

01:00:59.03 of flavors for you and everything you did oh we're talking doctor mike what's

01:01:03.05 happening with Geofferson speaking of survivor that

01:01:39.23 yeah she went to work dude she was totally okay she just had to get out the

01:01:43.02 system I couldn't believe it I was like there's no way you can go to work and

01:01:46.12 she's like I'm a hairdresser I can't reschedule stuff I don't have a choice

01:01:49.14 that's fair you know she probably said uh a stylist but yeah um so yeah she was

01:01:55.05 like no I don't like Emily doesn't [ __ ]

01:01:58.13 around she's like I I she's a you know she's a hard worker that one

01:02:15.01 them put them in the freezer I it looked like a bubble gum I'm gonna get a blue

01:02:18.10 bubble gum there's something I'm guessing there's a cookie dough there's

01:02:21.20 definitely cookie dough yeah there's a few I was wondering whether you would

01:02:25.12 have to displace some of the freezer contents to make room or whether you

01:02:29.01 would oh I absolutely had a rumor yes no I had to I had to shuffle things around

01:03:16.23 content from our company lately just checking in on things and so I've been

01:03:21.09 listening to some of our our peer podcasts and one of them is very popular

01:03:25.15 it's a cooking show uh with some uh yeah like some ugly or less talented people

01:03:29.12 than us but they're pretty good a cooking show it's called face jam uh

01:03:34.13 yeah they eat food and they talk about it right and uh nick nick and Eric are

01:03:38.18 actually both on that show nick is uh he's a he plays a character called the

01:03:42.10 sauce monkey and Eric plays a character uh the character of a producer who likes

01:03:47.03 them more than he likes us and as evidence to that

01:03:49.19 I have this clip I'd like this is just like just a random episode I was

01:03:53.00 listening to and this isn't I played it for Emily and she's like so that was

01:03:56.17 like cut up from all the whole episode of like a compilation I was like no no

01:03:59.16 this is just one one specific moment it's interesting and I just want to see

01:04:05.10 what you guys think about it this is I know I'll tell you

01:04:09.03 hold on I'll tell you before it goes in uh air mike Michael Jones makes a joke

01:04:14.10 about how nick talks to himself in his car okay and Eric liked that joke

01:04:19.13 a little lob to whisper what do you think it's like when he drives home from

01:04:24.16 work by himself he just goes red lights

01:04:35.03 okay

01:04:38.17 it's so [ __ ] funny why doesn't he think we're funny I've

01:04:43.14 never heard nick I've I've never heard Eric laugh like that

01:04:49.02 interesting well I'm muted on this yeah do you understand how the recording of

01:04:53.15 this works I don't know the reporting you see listen listen all I know is when

01:04:58.10 you talk on face jam you're happy and you like them and you laugh like that uh

01:05:02.09 for an hour and a half straight and on this podcast you just yell at us and

01:05:05.20 tell us to stop making it you don't listen to my audio file where I'm

01:05:10.23 constantly laughing through what's going on but I'm muted because this is just

01:05:16.20 you guys so you so what we hear uh-huh is just you hating us watch this can you

01:05:22.08 hear what I'm saying no you can't hey did you know I was talking that

01:05:27.04 whole time Geoff no you didn't I was muted because you don't tell me you show

01:05:31.01 the world why would I tell you how do you understand the different this is

01:05:34.17 insane this is insane see this is what I'm

01:05:37.22 talking about if I was Michael right now you'd be laughing [Laughter]

01:05:42.16 a second remember fast food joke okay you can laugh now fast food joke I

01:05:47.20 said fast food joke huh you can laugh fast fast food

01:05:56.12 oh you're getting something out of him that did that didn't feel like a real

01:06:00.15 laugh to me that didn't feel like that yeah

01:06:12.00 what I walked away from is uh Eric likes those people more than he likes us

01:06:24.04 maintenance probably oh without a doubt definitely absolutely 100

01:06:29.18 yeah and like the orders of toilets yeah

01:06:32.21 and impossible schedules there are times where I will float ideas to Eric and I

01:06:38.08 do so with the expectation of him saying no that's [ __ ] dumb and then like

01:06:42.14 maybe trying to find a middle and then he just absorbs them like oh no I don't

01:06:46.17 expect this to actually happen as this suggesting a thing I get nervous he's

01:06:51.01 probably like thank god I have face jam later today to

01:06:54.05 to balance this out okay well yeah I just love going and hanging out with

01:06:57.20 Michael and then he says fast food joke and I was like he says some sort of a

01:07:03.03 fast food joke and then you go yeah yeah for now evidence you presented wasn't

01:07:08.04 even a fast food joke to do with food it was about him leaving

01:07:12.10 a fast food restaurant in his car yeah but that's not that's like the context

01:07:16.14 of the the joke is the red light yeah that's like calling addresses story

01:07:22.06 a mole joke yeah it's just the the setting of it it's

01:07:25.08 like you asking what flavor the ramen was when it had no bearing on the story
