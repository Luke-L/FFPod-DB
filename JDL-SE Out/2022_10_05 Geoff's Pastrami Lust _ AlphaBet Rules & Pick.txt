00:00:14.22 Hello and welcome to another episode of the F**kFuckFacePodcast my name is Geoff Ramsey

00:00:20.08 with me as always Andrew Patton Gavin Free episode

00:00:23.23 123. One two three uh one two three there you go uh year or something

00:00:29.11 whatever uh okay so bringing back the year you can't half-ass it I just don't

00:00:35.08 know what it is it's like here whatever whatever I'm just happy he's back to

00:00:40.12 this place I'm working my way back into it after

00:00:43.15 after the slanderous day I had where you guys yelled at me about it fair play uh

00:00:48.19 I uh man I'm struggling to figure out how to start this after the conversation

00:00:54.20 we just had uh between episodes um we determine well pastrami

00:01:00.09 let's start with pastrami I'm gonna upload a photo you guys have already

00:01:05.04 seen it but just for posterity yeah uh just so we know what we're looking at I

00:01:11.04 have so many questions uh the other day uh this story actually starts before the

00:01:16.08 pastrami um pretty strumming it's priests from me

00:01:19.12 yeah it starts with about three weeks ago I went uh out to breakfast with

00:01:24.10 Emily and on the menu was uh migas which I love uh get me guess all the time uh

00:01:33.01 and they had like for us the daily special was corned beef migas and I

00:01:37.21 thought that sounds gross but I bet it's not and I did like corn

00:01:43.15 corned beef is how I got the pastrami I discovered I liked corned beef and then

00:01:48.22 I thought and I'd read I read online that pastrami was better than corned

00:01:52.07 beef and it was like prepared better and like I think corned beef was boiled

00:01:57.23 whereas pastrami is smoked um and so I thought well you know corned

00:02:02.12 beef was my I guess my on-ramp to pastrami maybe it'll be how I return to

00:02:07.22 pastrami right and so I ordered the corned beef migas and uh you know.

00:02:14.02 Migos is good corned beef is good together it was a little weird but it

00:02:19.11 wasn't gross I like I wouldn't necessarily eat it again

00:02:23.07 uh I appreciate the creativity of that chef but um but the the big takeaway was

00:02:28.09 corned beef meat is not great corned beef was okay I I was like oh this is it

00:02:33.13 isn't bad you know and so uh just last week I was riding around uh running

00:02:37.09 errands and I was super [ __ ] hungry and I thought you know what I had the

00:02:41.14 corned beef and it was okay what if I just rip off the Band-Aid I happen to be

00:02:45.06 in the part of town where my favorite Deli my favorite pastrami sandwich in

00:02:49.18 Austin is this place called beaderman's over on Far West and I thought

00:02:53.22 uh what if I just dip in I got some time to kill and I'll just order my pastrami

00:02:58.08 sandwich and we'll just [ __ ] see what happens like corned beef didn't gross me

00:03:01.12 out I can say the word pastrami again without getting nauseous

00:03:05.01 um you know I've clearly I've clearly made progress Let's uh let's see where

00:03:09.06 we let's see where we are and so I I went in and I ordered my favorite

00:03:14.04 pastrami sandwich in town the best pastrami I've ever had in my life and I

00:03:17.23 sat down and I started to eat it and the

00:03:20.17 I immediately was hit with a little wave of nausea

00:03:24.18 from the smell from the smell uh but I got past it I got past it and I just ate

00:03:30.18 I just ate Pastrami and uh the love affair is over

00:03:35.05 it was so good it was just it was yeah yeah wow you can't go home again I

00:03:42.16 was telling Emily and she's she described that as you were never in love

00:03:47.11 with pastrami it was only everlust and I

00:03:50.07 think that that's and it burned you yeah and I think I was burned by lust and I

00:03:55.11 think that yeah I I don't know what else

00:03:56.10 to say I didn't even finish the sandwich it didn't make me want to throw up it

00:03:59.21 didn't gross me out it didn't make me gag it just you didn't think this was

00:04:04.09 just a bad pastrami sandwich I don't think so I think it was I mean look at

00:04:10.00 it it looks gorgeous it was just and it's identical to any pastrami of

00:04:13.21 the pickle was phenomenal uh but yeah on it that's yeah just honey it's just

00:04:19.23 mustard okay uh uh that that sandwich is just bread like

00:04:23.10 rye bread or whatever bread that is not rye bread but whatever bread that is and

00:04:27.05 then uh hot pastrami and hot mustard that's all those sandwiches ingredients

00:04:31.13 it looks pretty good but I know I would be done with it after one half uh yeah I

00:04:36.22 mean it seems like a lot I uh I normally uh previously had been

00:04:40.23 able to destroy that sandwich uh and not leave one crumb on the on the table

00:04:46.13 I didn't make it through half I mean wow I probably made 33 of the way through

00:04:51.22 the sandwich and then I just threw it away uh I'm a little bummed yeah yeah

00:04:56.22 I'm a little bummed because at least before you didn't know yeah before I

00:05:00.15 didn't know and I just had like I just kind of had a memory of loving it and

00:05:04.18 now that memory is a bit obscured by the reality that I no longer connect with

00:05:10.00 pastrami on any sort of uh I don't know guttural flavor-based level

00:05:15.04 it's kind of like going home and visiting your hometown after going to

00:05:19.03 college I assume and seeing it for what it is you know after time has passed and

00:05:23.03 you're like oh this is it's a lot smaller than I remembered it's not quite

00:05:26.07 as it doesn't the the buildings don't shine quite as bright you know uh and

00:05:30.06 and that was definitely the case for pastrami it doesn't it doesn't make

00:05:35.12 me sick it doesn't gross me out but I don't think I like it

00:05:38.20 I this is a perfect bookend I feel to your pastrami arc on this show I like

00:05:44.15 that we have fully captured you falling in lust I guess with the pastrami

00:05:49.01 sandwich your your breakup with it your devastating end and then your ability to

00:05:54.16 return and realize that you're not the same person that you previously I mean

00:06:00.04 clearly clearly pastrami hasn't changed I have right I can't blame you oh

00:06:03.22 absolutely yeah uh but I did but I can't lie to myself you know I have to

00:06:08.16 acknowledge that uh I'm different I'm not the person I was for better or worse

00:06:14.15 I guess that probably remains to be seen but uh yeah I think uh I think pastrami

00:06:20.10 days are are in the rearview mirror do you think they'll try and replace it

00:06:25.13 I mean I wasn't trying to find it in the first place it just fell in my life

00:06:30.16 have you ever had this happen with another food uh

00:06:34.18 uh no yeah well I mean I went through a natural life cycle with corn dogs right

00:06:40.02 where like I loved them for most of my life and then I realized that I'd I

00:06:43.18 think I just was done with them but I I kind of felt that happening gradually

00:06:48.01 over time like I enjoyed each corn dog a little bit less than the previous one

00:06:51.07 where it's like kind of like San Francisco the first time I ever went to

00:06:54.22 San Francisco and I was like 19 or 20. I was on tour with that with the band I

00:06:58.12 used to tour with and I had the best night of my life and I thought Sunday I

00:07:01.15 will move to San Francisco I will live in this city this is the greatest place

00:07:04.18 on Earth and the next time I went to San Francisco I was like that's like 80 as

00:07:08.07 good as I remember that night and then it just got like five percent shittier

00:07:11.07 each time now that I'm like I don't ever need to go to San Francisco again as

00:07:15.00 long as I live thank God I never made the mistake to move there so your life

00:07:19.14 is just a series of diminishing returns yeah I guess so you know like like the

00:07:25.06 I I felt like the corn dog thing happened naturally and gradually whereas

00:07:30.19 this was a shock to my system and I I really

00:07:34.03 I really thought that if I could get over the physical uh

00:07:38.18 uh like revulsion from the memory of the intense vomiting uh that day that I'd I

00:07:44.10 could get back to to you know like sunny day sunny pastrami days again and uh it

00:07:49.11 was it was a pretty God it was it was it was pretty depressing if I'm being

00:07:53.02 honest with you it was it was a sad car ride uh home that day well it's a

00:07:57.07 different experience you know I'm like the San Francisco thing you could

00:08:00.23 probably say the city changed as well as you this is the situation in which you

00:08:05.12 have changed the same which is the same it's just it's not it's not for you

00:08:10.08 anymore Andrew do you worry about that happening with us what like what

00:08:15.16 like you've you've come here before you've met us before do you do you worry

00:08:19.07 that if when you come again is that why you put it off because when you come

00:08:23.05 here again it won't be as good no it's no it's no different I don't

00:08:27.06 understand the question I've never what if you've changed or we've changed we've

00:08:31.16 talked every week and throughout the week for the past like two and a half

00:08:34.22 years three years however long we've done this I don't it's too constant

00:08:38.11 there's been no break period Well it's been a break of interacting in real life

00:08:42.01 yeah but I mean that's not all that socially different it's the same we're

00:08:46.21 the same people I don't think I'd change anything I will

00:08:50.05 say I will say you stopped talking to me for like two years for no reason that

00:08:54.14 was Prior and we were able to pick pick right back up so yeah although I wonder

00:09:00.07 if maybe gatherer you were that'll happen on your

00:09:02.22 end with Andrew like you'll see him we'll see like in November we'll go to

00:09:07.05 Canada or he'll come here and you'll go like wow oh no I remembered liking him

00:09:11.10 more no I'm not worried about that I'm not worried about that either I'm

00:09:15.22 worried about it being weird what do you mean why would it be weird I'm worried

00:09:19.10 about it being weird when we try and make one of these in person oh in person

00:09:23.01 oh well I don't know that we should ever make a face in person I think we should

00:09:26.23 make ancillary content shoulder content but maybe not the main we should never

00:09:31.17 make a podcast no I don't know that we should I like

00:09:35.09 the idea of if we do it in person we need to like create cardboard walls

00:09:40.06 between us like it still needs to even though we're physically in the same

00:09:43.10 space there needs to be a removal

00:09:48.02 has anybody ever done a reverse triangle podcast where the hosts I'll look out

00:09:53.12 away from each other why don't we do one face to each other and one facing away

00:09:58.11 and see which one's better that's a great idea now that I would do

00:10:03.14 uh I think it'll be fine though because humans are more complex than pastrami so

00:10:07.10 I think that they'll I'm Not Afraid uh of things being weird between us ever I

00:10:11.17 don't well no I guess it's not I'm trying to think if I've ever had a

00:10:15.09 moment with food where it's been a true it's not you it's me because I I think

00:10:19.07 you still think the pastrami sandwich in the realm of sandwiches is good it's

00:10:23.18 just not for you is that yeah it's still beautiful I still think it's yeah it's

00:10:28.17 just it's just not for you're right I said I've changed it's not you pastrami

00:10:32.19 it's me which would be that that's the new name of my that's be the name of my

00:10:37.06 second autobiography

00:10:39.23 uh so should we get into this alphabet thing because we've teased it we've gone

00:10:45.04 on for multiple weeks with it and it sounds based on what you've said that

00:10:50.20 there might be some debates and arguments relating well

00:10:54.09 how this is gonna pursue so so I went uh

00:10:57.05 Emily and I went to dinner with Eric and his small wife Barbara recently and uh

00:11:01.08 we actually went to went to our double date spot Gavin uh our shabu-shabu Place

00:11:06.07 uh by the way Eric do you guys like that did you guys enjoy oh that was that was

00:11:10.23 awesome I'm gonna I gotta go back do you

00:11:13.22 think I would have liked it if it was me there instead of you [Applause]

00:11:17.10 well I mean I guess that would be here's

00:11:19.08 the thing that that would mean you would have to show up for the double date and

00:11:23.06 I don't know so I haven't seen a lot of evidence of that I've Just Seen evidence

00:11:27.04 of you not showing up honestly so but you know what I'll say yeah I think you

00:11:32.07 would have liked it this is lovely that reminds me of a side

00:11:35.08 thing not the completely the track from this I thought this was interesting I

00:11:40.06 was talking to Gavin after we recorded the episode in which you got your guilt

00:11:45.22 basket Geoff yeah I was asking him his opinions on PS5 games

00:11:49.16 Gavin doesn't own a PS5.

00:11:52.11 [Laughter]

00:11:53.21 Well I did

00:11:58.19 and I've been going back and forth on trying to decide if that made the

00:12:03.12 gesture better or worse he didn't buy that for you he that was his PS5 that he

00:12:09.19 just had for a while and then he thought it would be it would fit this oh yeah

00:12:14.19 applied it to this I had it no well I arrived and I thought oh I'm excited

00:12:19.13 I've been trying for about two years to go to these and I finally got the

00:12:23.05 opportunity to get one but then it was just a much better face to myself to

00:12:27.14 immediately give it away as a super inappropriate sorry gift it's just way

00:12:33.09 more funny to me that's true and for the record I assumed

00:12:37.23 here's what I assumed I assumed because Gavin and Meg are uh in in the industry

00:12:41.23 as it were uh and both very successful I assumed that there were probably like a

00:12:47.06 garage with like eight PlayStations they just keep getting free plays ps5s

00:12:51.00 from places like like back in the day back in the like the uh earlier days of

00:12:55.09 achievement Microsoft would give us [ __ ] Xboxes like candy like that

00:12:59.12 would be there was a time when I had like 13 Xboxes right and uh I just

00:13:03.11 assumed it was like just on on the pile of ps5s at his house and I didn't think

00:13:07.07 it diminished the the gesture in any way whatsoever okay well that's what I was

00:13:12.05 just shocked I was stunned to hear that he doesn't have one has never played a.

00:13:16.05 PS5 game completely caught me off guard they're a lot easier to get now so I

00:13:20.10 think I can get another one I'll let you borrow mine that was funny

00:13:23.18 Geoff you can drive in Gavin's car pick up Gavin and then drive back in his car

00:13:28.12 to play your PS5 that's absolutely true that's what we can do

00:13:33.00 float away though I was stunt I couldn't process it because like you said I

00:13:38.04 assumed that they had a room filled with ps5s that there's maybe even a

00:13:42.23 consideration to fix the hole in his wall with his PS5 because he has so many

00:13:48.08 of them that is sort of what I am at the house filled with ps5s I'm shocked zero

00:13:55.02 do you have a PS5 Andrew I don't well I know how you can get one

00:14:00.04 schedule so it's not gonna work that's fantastic we're not late I'm never gonna

00:14:06.14 get a no show again yeah uh so we go to dinner and it's a lovely

00:14:10.05 little dinner at our favorite place I did it was [ __ ] awesome it'd been a

00:14:13.13 minute since we've been there so I was thoroughly enjoying it uh and then quite

00:14:17.08 naturally throughout the course of dinner the alphabet uh.

00:14:22.14 I just just came to me the alphabet uh just came up uh or it came up naturally

00:14:30.07 and we got to talking about it and I realized uh that there we're we're gonna

00:14:35.07 wade into some into some contentious territory I think when we start naming

00:14:41.02 what foods uh we can eat alphabet is such a good name it's not a great name

00:14:46.12 yeah uh Eric and I I realized were not of the

00:14:51.19 same mind uh on on what stuff is like for instance if you draw if you pull an o

00:14:58.22 you pull an o right and you have to eat only things that start with the letter O

00:15:04.21 for the next however many days can you get an Oreo yeah yeah Eric says no oh

00:15:10.12 you like can't do brand names well here see here's the thing this is between the

00:15:16.15 three of you I when presented with this information.

00:15:21.17 Oreo is a cookie you have to yes so Nick is right is he thinking cookie yeah I'm

00:15:25.13 thinking of what the thing is because I think that everyone's gonna go into like

00:15:31.21 well I got tea okay well I'm gonna eat Tyson chicken like I think it gets to

00:15:37.14 granular when you go to that uh because then you can kind of make everything

00:15:42.03 into everything but again this is between the three of you and I want to

00:15:47.04 know where you stand because here's the thing when it's just the three of you

00:15:50.05 there's a tie breaker there's a natural there has to be a natural tiebreaker

00:15:53.22 between three so yeah that's why I want to know where that stands cookie well I

00:15:58.18 guess for me it would be a biscuit it'd be B

00:16:01.10 I think if you held that makes it even more complicated because yeah that's it

00:16:05.19 different am I allowed to use my own culture's

00:16:09.20 words that's a very funny you say that because I was explaining this idea to my

00:16:15.10 mom yesterday of this this bet we're gonna do and she immediately started

00:16:20.14 feeding me uh food items in different languages

00:16:24.07 being like ah chocolate in in this language starts with an X you got X

00:16:28.19 covered we're talking about some of the harder letters

00:16:31.19 that salad creaming is like in your blood like it's been passed down to you

00:16:36.22 from your mother like that's a sour cream BS or c for cream

00:16:41.11 it depends on what language you're using or D for dressing right like it gets or

00:16:48.22 even like no stick it with Oreos like if you get C for cookie right can you eat

00:16:54.07 an Oreo or if with C can I eat so this is I think a great sort of rule for this

00:17:00.22 you're the worst you're a menace yeah I heard somebody comment saying like a

00:17:07.22 good qualifier could be what it would be listed in a grocery store like for the

00:17:13.20 display sign for what you do okay that is what I said I said to me it's based

00:17:18.08 on the aisle because Geoff was like well what about like a Kit Kat I'm like

00:17:21.22 that's candy do you get it from the KitKat aisle no you get it from the

00:17:25.21 candy like to me that's where it lands but again this is between the three of

00:17:29.17 you I can just I can only offer input like that I think and I know this is

00:17:35.02 wild for me to be the one saying this just we we just kind of I think know

00:17:40.03 what is and isn't [ __ ] I disagree on anything and anything that is no because

00:17:45.09 like if you if there'd be nothing Lamer then if you get M and then you just eat

00:17:49.08 every meat available that sucks and I don't think you could do that I I think

00:17:53.12 you're the last person that should be giving this speech no I agree that's why

00:17:57.06 I opened it with this I agree completely

00:17:59.05 you're totally right that's a good point like em can I eat M M's or does that

00:18:03.06 fall under sea for candy no that's M M's those are M M's I don't think this is I

00:18:08.12 think we're over complicating it I think we know what starts with what and if

00:18:13.22 there's any confusion why don't we do a thing is there a point system for this

00:18:18.06 how is this working that sounds complicated you just said we're over

00:18:23.11 complicating it and then said is there a

00:18:27.00 point system surely like me eating a Red.

00:18:30.07 Baron pizza is pizza I'm not gonna go ah right right but then why is Eminem an m

00:18:35.01 and not C for candy yeah that should be chocolate or candy see that's what

00:18:40.13 that's what I'm saying and and I think that because to me it excludes one way

00:18:44.15 or the other like if you take oreo for instance it's either o for Oreo or it's

00:18:49.11 c for cookie but in no way can it be both right something can't be both like

00:18:54.20 here's another example s for Snickers or is it C for candy or B for bar so I

00:18:59.17 think we just need to make a rule or c for chocolate is K is his Snickers

00:19:04.21 chocolate bar a bar of candy I think we go with brand names how about

00:19:12.10 this we we make note of everything that we have for a letter we we submit it to

00:19:18.09 each other each day and if there's a majority disagree like a ruling on I in

00:19:23.07 an item two of three agreed that that's not it then then it's out maybe you get

00:19:28.21 negative points is Sushi s or is it fish it's sushi exactly Sushi I guess okay

00:19:35.11 yes that's easy you keep coming back to a point system and it's really it really

00:19:41.05 has me worried well because I'm trying to determine a penalty for right if you

00:19:46.01 just [ __ ] up like then how do we keep track of if because if we all make

00:19:49.10 mistakes there has to be a differentiator how about this idea how

00:19:52.18 about this idea because I I agree with you on principle how about this we did

00:19:57.04 we I'll just lay it all out okay so we get

00:20:01.10 the Bingo uh we get the Bingo wheel uh we we get the 26 numbers and everybody

00:20:06.23 gets to pull out one number that's associated with that letter

00:20:10.02 let's say from this point on on Friday till Monday morning at 900 a.m or

00:20:14.23 whatever the date range we associate we can only eat foods that start with that

00:20:20.07 letter right uh you write down or photograph everything

00:20:24.06 that you eat throughout the weekend right and then on Monday or whenever we

00:20:29.12 record next we reconcile it like this we look at the full list of everything

00:20:34.02 everybody eats and we do the two-thirds majority and we go through and you get

00:20:39.07 us like you get a strikeout on anything that you eat that is determined uh to be

00:20:44.11 wrong and then whoever has the most strikeouts

00:20:47.07 whereas the least strikeouts wins okay okay sounds fine does that like so it's

00:20:51.17 not like a point system it's more like it's more like we're punishing people

00:20:55.06 for eating the wrong thing and whoever ate the most wrong things whoever ate

00:20:59.07 the least wrong things wins and we're relying on the fact that two or three of

00:21:02.20 us will agree that something is [ __ ]

00:21:05.02 it's in majority rules right if it's 50

00:21:08.17 50 then you don't get a strike should we do

00:21:10.22 a three-strike penalty three strikes you're out type thing you're immediately

00:21:14.16 out if you get three so that could build

00:21:16.11 tension if I could just take strikes all day if Gavin has 12 strikes I could eat

00:21:21.04 two or three strikes well we won't know I think ideally we don't know about the

00:21:25.17 strikes till we till we oh so we submit do we submit our strikes to Eric I don't

00:21:30.22 think we submit our Foods I don't think we should I think we should just present

00:21:35.07 what we did in the recording yeah we do the the strike slide okay I didn't know

00:21:40.21 if I thought you meant that like the idea of we send like our items to Eric

00:21:45.06 and our or no we send the items to each other and then we tell our strikes to

00:21:50.15 Eric so Eric knows how many strikes we all have but we don't I think it's

00:21:54.03 better to get our reactions as we record yeah I agree and that's a game you can

00:22:00.01 play like if you if you get pee for pizza right but you really you really

00:22:03.23 want some shrimp on Saturday you can eat that shrimp and take the hit and just

00:22:07.09 hope that you're taking less hits than the other players you know let's have a

00:22:10.18 prawn that's a calculated gamble oh okay or you have a king prom yeah uh but um

00:22:15.22 but yeah I think I think it has to the reveal all has to happen live and uh

00:22:20.01 while we record so I think that's I think that should be the parameters I

00:22:23.05 also we talked about doing it for a week I don't want to waste a week I have

00:22:26.20 dinner reservations and [ __ ] places uh

00:22:28.14 so I was just thinking the weekend would work so like do we want to do it from

00:22:31.19 like the second this podcast ends until like oh no we're going a week we can't

00:22:36.14 just do a weekend we can't shorten it that's [ __ ] oh we gotta go weak a

00:22:42.00 week Monday to when we record yeah so it starts Monday and then it goes until

00:22:47.09 next Thursday I think I'm filming on next week oh see that's what I'm saying

00:22:54.03 I got to be ordering you're the worst oh dear that's what I'm saying I got

00:22:59.04 nothing this weekend but time I don't I think the weekend is lame though I don't

00:23:03.08 think that's enough time we need more time than just three days I kind of

00:23:08.01 agree with Andrew it's annoying that is for my schedule so so let's start Monday

00:23:13.15 first thing Monday morning and go till till the recording on Thursday

00:23:18.09 or Monday dinner reservations you don't

00:23:20.19 want to [ __ ] up dude it's fine I'll live

00:23:22.16 with it I'll I'll find something on the right on the menu that I can eat I mean

00:23:25.22 that's kind of the point of the challenge right

00:23:28.18 I'm taking Millie out for sushi on Monday night so I hope I get a [ __ ] s

00:23:34.11 and are we saying you can't have the same item of food twice

00:23:38.23 uh I think that's overly complicated yeah I think I think you can do what you

00:23:44.11 want to so I could just have four pieces if you get pee yeah I guess so I wanted

00:23:48.22 to say I only ate pizza for only a pizza

00:23:51.03 40. I think that works I'm gonna try and

00:23:52.20 get a different piece of food every time just just in case bonus points become a

00:23:57.09 part of it I also there I've heard other comments of like suggesting we could do

00:24:01.06 this multiple weeks and just like remove them from the pool if we want to I feel

00:24:05.15 like there's room that we could expand on this if we want to yeah we'll

00:24:09.04 remember which ones we had yeah I just will not put them back in the hopper

00:24:14.01 that's great this feels like the first iteration of what could be a lot of

00:24:19.07 content going forward like you know when Eric and I were getting into this and

00:24:24.00 heavily disagreeing at dinner the other night uh

00:24:27.07 we did both agree that a contest where we could only eat literally we get we go

00:24:31.19 and we can only eat from one aisle at the grocery store is a great idea and

00:24:35.05 like we all we all just randomly get it out get the aisle whatever all you get

00:24:37.12 is what you're stuck with so I think there's a lot of different ways a lot of

00:24:41.07 different offshoots we can do a lot of different versions of this going forward

00:24:46.09 this is just be like our first one [Applause]

00:29:27.10 one one yeah everything is there outside of the three it's a 33s the three

00:29:32.10 everything else is represented as it should okay I would like to could we

00:29:36.08 could we have like a photo of like what alphabet thing is where what number

00:29:40.16 because I don't know off the top of my head what [ __ ] 16 is oh I see okay I

00:29:44.23 thought you meant for like like so that way we're all clear okay I

00:29:49.02 understand now let me let me grab something got it yeah just to post in

00:29:52.11 the chat just so we could look at it while you do that I will position myself

00:29:56.15 do you want me to make this spin for a little bit or just immediate is fine I

00:30:02.08 think it should spin okay so I'm gonna it's gonna be so [ __ ] hot I'm worn

00:30:06.09 for first that's a great question who wants to go first well and also do Eric

00:30:10.23 and Nick want to participate Eric said no but I want to offer Nick the

00:30:15.23 opportunity no absolutely not no okay so that you're just gonna help us

00:30:21.22 judge I guess okay yeah yeah I like oh Nick I have a kid I have a kid too

00:30:26.15 Nick yeah but you're gonna find Millie's

00:30:28.11 leftovers that's true yeah I'll help you guys judge if you need help but I I

00:30:33.03 think you probably got this okay I'm here to watch people suffer so who wants

00:30:37.09 to go first well let's do a test let's do a test

00:30:40.06 okay can we is there is it possible we can see you pulling the numbers is there

00:30:45.03 any way to I don't know how I would do that okay

00:30:49.01 web cam or something my phone I could record the video just record your hands

00:30:54.01 doing it or something yeah record yourself it's a machine pulling the I'm

00:30:58.11 not touching anything ah until you have to push a button or spin

00:31:02.18 a wheel or something you have to hit a button but I'm saying like it's not like

00:31:06.09 my hand yeah but record that process so we can see it come out I was more

00:31:10.23 worried about the implication that I somehow was pulling specific things but

00:31:15.10 if you show us the [ __ ] video then we'll have it already overlay it we'll

00:31:19.12 know it's legit yeah do you want do you want us to I don't

00:31:24.00 need to see the video right now but like

00:31:26.18 just record it actually it would be nice if you upload well whatever uh I'll

00:31:29.22 defer to the others for that but I I say we do one as a test right now and just

00:31:33.11 see what it would be why are we doing why aren't we going in

00:31:36.23 let's just do it now let's just do it there's no way okay Gavin goes first why

00:31:41.00 am I good okay sweet yeah that's great because I go yeah I'll go first

00:31:44.16 so I assume you're setting up for a little video Yeah narrow it narrate this

00:31:49.23 guy right now I'm now recording the wheel okay I'm hitting the button

00:31:56.04 it sucks oh my God it's so [ __ ] loud get me a good one we got we got two

00:32:02.07 numbers came out we'll just keep oh it went back in Gavin's got

00:32:07.18 seven whatever seven is g seven G

00:32:17.10 that's perfect I could try some Gaviscon [Laughter]

00:32:23.12 what are foods that start with G I'm drawing a blank uh

00:32:28.23 uh grain yeah like it garlic grapes grapefruit uh guava let's see here's

00:32:36.20 where it gets confusing Ginger can you have green peppers I would say so or is

00:32:43.00 that P for pepper that's so that's just ingredients gelatin gouda cheese

00:32:51.13 grits yeah oh gummy bears can you have gummy bears

00:32:55.16 I don't know that's a terrible air I think I think it is dude you're in

00:33:00.13 trouble gravy dude you're gonna eat so much garlic

00:33:05.07 Andrew and I just watched the uh the season finale of the USA challenge the

00:33:10.05 the the new Challenge season and on the last episode The they had to hike 10

00:33:15.07 miles up a mountain in the snow in Patagonia and halfway through they had

00:33:20.06 to stop and eat an entire onion and 10

00:33:22.21 cloves of garlic and I have never seen people throw up as much in my entire

00:33:28.03 life so be careful how much garlic you eat are we ready for the next drop yeah

00:33:31.23 make sure are you filming still yeah so who's the next one me or Andrew you're

00:37:49.04 you shouldn't have had this idea Geoff from saying that the

00:37:54.01 the cap challenge was too easy so he created a new thing and then he got

00:37:59.10 faced by his own idea perfect perfect well hey Geoff at least you don't

00:40:52.01 everything I make is like there's some things that look edible but it's going

00:40:55.15 to require me to cook for like seven hours

00:41:24.09 when it comes to toppings.

00:42:12.10 the round of this one of the worst letters out of the rotation

00:42:16.18 theoretically can only get easier for you oh here we go I can eat uluku it's

00:42:22.06 second only to the potato at one of the most widely grown root vegetable crops

00:42:26.04 in the Andean regions of South America so it's readily available for me here is

00:42:31.12 brightly colored with waxy skin it can be yellow pink or purple and Hue cool.

00:42:37.12 [Laughter]

00:42:38.16 It's a big big and it's a big traditional food during Catholic Holy.

00:42:43.16 Week in Bolivia awesome I'm sure that'll be easy to find

00:42:48.10 you can eat Ube it's like that purple yam oh that smells good yeah it sounds

00:42:53.14 like purple purple yams are delicious yeah purple's fun that's fun for you

00:42:58.23 that's fun this now this I could eat ugly fruit

00:43:01.02 ugly fruit or unique fruit commonly known as Jamaican tangelo is a citrus

00:43:05.21 fruit that arose through natural hybridization of the Tangerine with the

00:43:11.10 grapefruit I'm all about that can I get ugly fruit in Texas

00:43:14.10 can you make an ugly pie out of ugly yeah I was about to say is there no ugly

00:43:19.08 fruit and ugly pie umbrella if so that feels like a

00:43:23.06 tremendous waste I agree with Andrew uh I am Gavin do you have any

00:43:26.21 suggestions for Geoff

00:43:29.01 though this laughter is the only response needed

00:43:33.03 I was thinking about geez I'm just Geoff's in his own world of hate oh man I

00:43:38.11 feel like Nick brought up that you'd probably get an X if we did this again I

00:43:44.04 feel like we need to do this again just to see Andrew I I hope you are able to

00:43:48.06 muddle through four days of pizza oh it's gonna be yeah I might have to swap

00:43:54.03 it out with a pineapple it's a pineapple pieces uh potatoes it's gonna be a real

00:43:59.02 struggle you've got such an abundance of choice you can your choices will have P

00:44:05.07 you can put peas on your peas you could have pizza with all pea

00:44:08.08 ingredients yeah that's why I said a nice pepperoni pizza you're gonna double

00:44:12.01 up like that's how easy you've got it a pistachio maybe like I said one of the

00:44:17.05 top tier nuts from before I got a lot of choices I could go with you could also

00:44:22.22 eat peanuts the lowest tier of the nuts the coke of nuts yeah you can eat peas

00:44:28.23 I feel like I have to you can eat pretzels

00:44:33.11 are there any nuts you can eat Pringles nuts that start with you that's a great

00:44:38.13 question I'll clean up [Laughter]

00:44:43.05 I'm [ __ ] I'm [ __ ]

00:44:45.23 Uh no it doesn't look like it so here's the thing I have I think

00:44:52.03 without a doubt gotten the easiest letter to work with like undeniably I

00:44:57.03 think we would all agree p is the easiest the issue is as we've

00:45:01.19 established we got the salad cream veins over here I am probably the least

00:45:06.01 qualified so I'm terrified that I somehow I'm gonna screw this up with the

00:45:10.16 easiest position which feels very possible yeah if you salad cream the pee

00:45:15.02 I that would be the biggest waste it would be there'd be no hope for me

00:45:18.21 imagine how mad Geoff will be if you solid Queen having pee and he's been

00:45:23.07 dealing with you all week that's not that's a that's a Greg right there

00:45:27.14 that's not a salad cream it's way worse that's a great

00:45:31.12 uh yeah I think I would get out use my get out of Greg free card online

00:45:36.16 I think I'm just gonna have to walk around the grocery store and look for

00:45:41.18 [ __ ] that says that starts with you oh I hate I hate that I I hate that I I

00:45:46.07 hate that I said we should do this I love it I think it's the best thing

00:45:49.17 we've ever done potentially wait do we have to start this week uh Monday yeah

00:45:53.15 we're starting Monday so coming in Monday but this one won't come out for

00:45:56.22 this will come out two weeks from now this one will come out in two weeks and

00:46:00.21 then the actual and then one where we so when we talk about it since you're busy

00:46:04.11 all wait you're shooting all next week yeah that monkey lunch uh still is that

00:46:09.19 still okay we have to move the monkey lunch oh no come on

00:46:14.20 no well we go why don't we do monkey breakfast

00:46:19.20 no I'm not doing we're we're it's moving we're moving monkey lunch another week

00:46:25.16 we'll do monkey lunch and we'll do two more of these we'll do what was supposed

00:46:29.18 to be this week what the [ __ ] I could probably still make it happen no you

00:46:32.23 don't have to I don't want to you don't have to force don't listen to Andrew you

00:46:36.21 do have to he just wants more time to go through

00:46:40.06 his [ __ ] slime I'm almost done what about monkey evening then I'll do a

00:46:44.04 monkey evening it doesn't matter to me I I'm I'm happy I just want to film the

00:46:49.17 [ __ ] thing are we really moving it are we really

00:46:53.00 talking about moving [ __ ] monkey lunch

00:46:57.15 so gavinson I need that as a sound butt

00:47:00.18 oh Geoff what are you gonna eat for monkey lunch because at that point

00:47:07.15 uh I don't know man I'll probably eat pizza and grits

00:47:13.08 oh so will I well not the Grits but that'll be me all week I'll be sick of

00:47:19.22 pizza by the time you get there so we gotta start this Monday because we need

00:47:25.08 to discuss it in the next recording which

00:47:28.12 is next Thursday are you going to make face next Thursday is that okay

00:47:33.06 I'm assuming no so why did we set all this up well

00:47:36.23 because he didn't he didn't reveal that until after we did it but it's fine

00:47:40.14 because the next recording we'll do we'll have the whole thing finished

00:47:45.06 it'll be all done we could talk about our experience I think it's I I could I

00:47:50.05 can make these recordings I'll be there okay

00:47:53.23 okay there's something so not assuring about your assurances I'm so excited for

00:47:59.23 Geoff to eat you foods for four days and then we go and then Gavin goes well boys

00:48:04.19 guess what

00:48:08.09 that's great this is I feel all settled we got the system laid out sure what we

00:48:13.20 eat oh I can't wait to just be sending Geoff Pizza photos but what I was gonna

00:48:17.08 say was that we could potentially do this on the on like

00:48:21.09 I will be out of town that week is it for something worth it

00:48:25.20 yeah uh but uh but I also I also informed my producer about that like

00:48:31.06 months ago when it's been on my calendar it's true that's why we're not a

00:48:35.21 surprise this week I've known about I've known about that yeah that must be

00:48:39.01 awfully convenient knowing exactly when you can do something but I plan stuff

00:48:42.12 ahead you know yeah I'm sort of relying on the schedules of others Gavin the man

00:48:46.19 just drew a year he he just drew a u let's just we'll just let him it doesn't

00:48:51.14 matter who's right he drew you let him have it we're gonna let him have it in

00:48:55.21 this moment all right it's a tough day for him I

00:48:59.12 will say are we we get we all happy with

00:49:01.19 how this is scheduled we're fine with it before I move on yeah so Monday so for

00:49:07.11 three days from now we're starting great okay I wanna I wanna talk about a

00:49:12.07 different bet that we've discussed a little bit

00:49:14.14 the gamer score bad between Gavin I think and I don't know we haven't talked

00:49:18.23 about this because you've been away and I didn't want to bother you on your

00:49:22.07 vacation did you see that GoldenEye is coming out soon to the console I did and

00:49:28.03 I'm assuming GoldenEye was a big childhood game for you so when you

00:49:32.23 played it yeah it was it was my childhood it was your childhood I think

00:49:36.22 instead of the gamer score bet because after we recorded I had a bunch of

00:49:40.18 people just send me like here's a five dollar game that you could get a

00:49:43.19 thousand points in in three minutes I don't think the content that'd be made

00:49:47.12 from that would be that interesting I don't know how I'd make it like that's I

00:49:51.00 think the best part of all the game bets we've had is there's been a Content

00:49:54.01 piece attached to it this would just the gamer score thing would be essentially

00:49:57.21 just me throwing money at a problem to win it I don't think that's funny or all

00:50:01.22 that interesting why don't we do something in Golden eye when that comes

00:50:05.12 out it could be times they've got timed level things like I I just think there's

00:50:09.19 something there we're both Bond guys try and get like a 20 second frigate on

00:50:14.13 double o yeah like doing exactly what we did with the Halo and the times if we

00:50:18.14 want to go that way and do it on a bond level instead for GoldenEye since that's

00:50:22.07 right around the corner it seems why am I suddenly playing I'm just I'm

00:50:25.17 suggesting a bit you don't have to play if you want we could set times I just

00:50:29.07 haven't played the game in 20 years so I

00:50:31.11 don't know I can't be like I'm gonna get 45 seconds on this level I don't know

00:50:35.07 the level names I haven't played in a while I just let it be fun because we've

00:50:39.15 talked about wanting to do the Halo thing again in some form and I feel like

00:50:43.18 golden Knight could work because we both

00:50:45.19 I feel like would be equal at it I'd let you set the terms like in in the Halo

00:50:49.12 thing I'm just throwing it out there as a suggestion I think that'd be a better

00:50:52.20 idea than the gamer score bet take less time out of your life not necessarily

00:50:57.04 honestly I think if you had to get to a million gamer score in any short amount

00:51:01.16 of time it would ruin your life well we ended up the last time we settled was

00:51:05.17 half a mill yeah and I think that would be incredibly doable based off of the

00:51:10.09 information people have sent me I do think it is to Andrew's point I do think

00:51:15.16 it is throwing money at a problem to solve it uh yeah it's not it's nothing I

00:51:19.14 think funny or interesting I like I like

00:51:21.18 the GoldenEye angle I feel like you guys should both wear tuxedos the whole time

00:51:25.07 you're playing not the tuxedo obviously but tuxedos or

00:51:29.10 dress up as your address one of you has to dress up as odd job or like at an

00:51:33.19 adjustment your favorite favorite Bond character that's uh yeah I think that's

00:51:38.18 funny I don't think that needs to be requirement I like the idea though I

00:51:42.20 just think I just want to play Gold yeah it would be funny I agree all right

00:51:48.17 yeah I think that that'd be fun hey you guys are Halo guys can you explain to me

00:51:52.23 is is splitter in Co-op never coming out for Halo 5 is that what's or Halo

00:51:57.14 infinite is that what's going on here yeah it sounds like that that will never

00:52:01.12 happen so I held off on playing Halo for over a

00:52:04.22 year but that will be Co-op nothing they will have online co-op so I don't know

00:52:09.17 if you're and okay it's cross play as well so as long as you have a computer

00:52:14.21 and a concert no I just I have I we're in Xbox and one PS5 family so um

00:52:19.20 so I could still play with Millie we would just have to play on different

00:52:23.04 absolutely yeah she could just be in a hotel room and is that already out or is

00:52:27.13 that not no that is hoping I think hopefully to be up by the end of the year

00:52:33.07 yeah it's Halo infinite is a mess as far

00:52:36.00 as the content release I guess yeah it's probably one of my most played Halo

00:52:38.23 games though I still really like it yeah it's like there's it's the most

00:52:42.23 frustrating part of it is that at its core it's so good and the forge stuff

00:52:47.11 that is coming out for it looks incredible the things that people are

00:52:52.12 doing in just the beta for it is ridiculous just want to play the

00:52:55.17 campaign with my daughter it's a great campaign so excited for it I think one

00:53:00.05 of the hardest things to nail in Halo is like does it feel like Halo mm-hmm and

00:53:04.23 they got the feel right which is good that's they just don't have anything else

00:53:09.05 it's yeah I think the single player experience though you'll have a great

00:53:13.02 time it's really the multiplayer that is Barren yeah okay and I enjoyed the

00:53:17.18 multiplayer as little as I played but um that's not like Halo to me it is like

00:53:22.03 it's not that it's not good it's that nothing has changed since you've played

00:53:25.23 really like it's essentially the same game with no content updates so it's

00:53:30.23 just it's a little tired gotcha that's good uh well

00:53:35.20 uh what a good day are you okay what a good day for some of us are you all

00:53:40.13 right man man I was like just about any letter would have been fine but you

00:53:44.21 like I could have made a lot of stuff work

00:53:47.11 I mean I'm gonna make you work I'm gonna make it work I'll make it work I wonder

00:53:50.17 if we should try and go out for dinner one night and we'll order our respective

00:53:55.13 oh I love that yeah yeah that's a great idea what do you think I'm gonna order

00:53:58.23 I'm gonna order ugly fruit on.

00:54:02.04 I feel like I read a story recently where like the rock brings food to

00:54:07.02 restaurants for them to make like he brings his own food for them to cook

00:54:11.14 that could be you you could just bring your own you products yeah here's my UK

00:54:15.13 my Ukrainian dinner rolls please heat them up

00:54:22.11 how about this I'm there's a there's a sushi restaurant in Austin called Uchi

00:54:28.11 can I eat anything in that restaurant no no no that does not that's not doesn't

00:54:33.16 fly that's fair that's fair I don't expect you to have seen them because

00:54:37.14 you've been even a white Gavin have you watched any of survive Block Island at

00:54:40.22 this point three episodes have released or I guess two the third one came out

00:54:43.23 this morning yeah you watched any of that I watched the first two yeah I uh I

00:54:48.08 really enjoyed it and I think it's interesting to see what was edited out

00:54:52.01 of those episodes pretty much anything we did because we're never that's true I

00:54:56.20 don't know so far yeah that is we've had a lack of

00:55:00.17 coverage but I don't you know what made me really happy is and I don't know if

00:55:04.21 it's in episode three if it if it is it it will people have seen it by now but

00:55:09.20 you and I talked about that we built to a cloud in the sky and that it was

00:55:15.02 meaningless like there was nothing it was like a bug we thought there'd be

00:55:18.07 something up there we spent all this effort getting to it I don't know if I

00:55:21.08 could copy and paste error or something yeah I don't know if that scene is in

00:55:26.18 the show of us doing that but in like the first or second episode they do a

00:55:30.06 cool transition to the lava base and you can see our blocks in the sky and it

00:55:34.06 just made me so happy there's like a half second of our [ __ ] just like a

00:55:38.09 line that goes nowhere yeah that's brought me a lot of Joy I'll let you

00:55:41.15 don't really see us build anything at the base either but you can there's a

00:55:45.17 sign by the hot tub that I made it just says wet box and that made it

00:55:50.21 so I don't remember if it made the edit or not but so don't quote me on this but

00:55:57.07 if it didn't there was discussion because you guys did it we as actually

00:56:03.00 uh inconvenient you guys took forever to

00:56:06.06 do it and we it was just so funny we let you guys go and it actually pushed

00:56:09.18 production back a little bit while you guys climbed yourself oh no sorry it's

00:56:14.01 inconvenience no no that's fine it's fine it's okay I don't care uh but there

00:56:18.14 was a lot of discussion that day about clipping that and making it like

00:56:22.08 shoulder content like just taking that like that little non-sequitur out and

00:56:26.00 then just making it its own piece of content so I think if it didn't make the

00:56:29.17 episode it will make it out in some form sweet awesome I believe

00:56:35.10 because it was very very funny I watched you guys forever it was very funny

00:56:40.16 I uh yeah it's fun did uh we already never

00:56:43.13 mind never mind I was gonna say in the first episode it was interesting to see

00:56:47.11 that like it was edited about me failing to get I was so goddamn mad to see in

00:56:52.11 the first episode that that totem was just in the grass

00:56:55.07 I never thought I I assumed it would be in a chest somewhere I must have passed

00:56:59.00 it so many times they edited it out I went to that Island it was on I think

00:57:02.05 Blaine did too based on the episode I don't know how he didn't get it either

00:57:06.10 pretty funny that's good I'm excited you

00:57:08.10 excited Geoff you sound enthused yeah I'm gonna go I'm gonna go to the grocery

00:57:13.19 store now and I'm gonna start prepping uh yeah we should have yeah

00:57:18.04 I mean who could have foreseen this that's fair I figured he was gonna get

00:57:23.10 an h and eat hamburgers you know what I mean and then now

00:57:27.06 boy uh maybe maybe I'll dabble some pastrami I got that on the menu as well

00:57:32.11 maybe I could see where I line up but listen that's totally I recommend that I

00:57:37.04 think pastrami is lovely uh not for me but uh I want everybody else to I want

00:57:41.20 pastrami to enjoy other people and other people to enjoy pastrami I want nothing
