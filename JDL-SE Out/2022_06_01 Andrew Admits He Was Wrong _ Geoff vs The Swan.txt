00:00:26.02 let me introduce you to episode 105

00:00:29.07 of this podcast I don't know what I'm doing why do I want to leave this isn't

00:00:34.21 my job dude he's been on he's been in rare form uh he tried

00:00:39.00 he argued that no dance has ever been impressive for a while

00:00:42.22 and then we had to get we had to start we had to look up the

00:00:46.08 we had to look up the definition of impressions

00:00:48.12 it was like it was too much pleasantry wow we've been wait we've been around

00:00:51.16 for a while there are plenty of high skilled it was just disgusting mainly I

00:00:56.10 guess how I associate what impressed means to me how did you just eat or

00:01:00.08 drink like half an hour before this I I had a chicken wrap that Eric thought I

00:01:05.03 said rabbit and then it just kind of fired from that

00:01:08.22 I have a bird infestation in my home right now in my roof

00:01:13.05 I feel like I could catch a bird but a rabbit I could never catch with your

00:01:18.06 hands no I I said with like a mcdonald's bag and a net I if you give me a day

00:01:22.13 and a bag of mcdonald's that had fries in it at one point maybe even one fry

00:01:26.18 just to make it like super extra spicy on that trap I could catch me a seagull

00:01:31.11 how do I hire you to do this tomorrow buy me a net I guess

00:01:36.00 Eric can we amazon him a butterfly net is it gonna fit in his mail slot or

00:01:41.14 whatever no it'll be fun in there so I I may have killed somebody by

00:01:47.18 accident potentially go ahead so last episode where I think it was last one I

00:01:52.17 don't know this doesn't make any sense to me I talked about how I had okay

00:01:57.01 before you do that hello and welcome to another episode of the F**kFuckFacePodcast my

00:02:02.15 name is Geoff Ramsey with me as always uh Gavin free and uh newly confessed

00:02:06.15 murderer Andrew panton go ahead so now before I get into my murder I'd like to

00:02:10.07 I'd like to pivot for a minute to something else and just own up because

00:02:14.15 I'm a big I'm an accountability guy I want to own up to the fact that I was

00:02:19.14 wrong I was wrong last week I was in the wrong I handled the name thing

00:02:24.12 incorrectly I apologize I apologize to you both

00:02:27.09 this is I wanted to give my perspective on it because I I thought about it I put

00:02:32.02 some time in really think about this situation as well

00:02:35.02 you were so wrong this apology is annoying me oh I was I couldn't have

00:02:38.19 been more in the wrong why are you annoyed by my apology oh it's you know

00:02:43.18 it's just bringing it up again well because I just said oh the [ __ ]

00:02:49.03 Greg from a cat record the.

00:02:56.08 I was just trying to put it together and be like what [ __ ] name thing and then

00:03:00.19 uh nick said jeopardy rules and I was like oh did we do a jeopardy and I was

00:03:04.05 just out of it all right sorry yeah that's right you were a bit of a dick

00:03:08.10 about the name thing yeah I I appreciate it

00:03:10.05 I appreciate the apology cause cause I I was getting riled up with you're right

00:03:15.22 you're right it was ridiculous it was a ridiculous position to have and to hold

00:03:20.05 what happened was I was so excited about

00:03:22.15 the thing and I thought we're gonna give

00:03:24.15 clues we're gonna make this we're really gonna turn up the heat in these next

00:03:30.00 three episodes will you guys figure out the name will you not we will find out I

00:03:34.02 give one clue and Gavin immediately gets it and I was on tilt I was on tilt from

00:03:38.10 that moment forward and I didn't want it to end but I also deep down knew that

00:03:44.08 you guys would never fairly guess Greg again in a different context so I liked

00:03:48.12 700 more episodes before we realized how close we were I also never in my head I

00:03:53.13 had the the jeopardy rules I never established this that's unfair me if I

00:03:56.23 would have from the beginning stated that I think that'd be fair but that was

00:04:00.17 unfair so I just wanted I I put some thought into it and I've been haunted

00:04:05.23 by that moment since we recorded not because of that itself that was just I

00:04:11.14 processed I realized that I was wrong I handled that poorly what has haunted me

00:04:15.14 is Geoff was coming at me and I was getting mad at Geoff and we're going back

00:04:20.06 and forth and and I called you the dictionary kid

00:04:24.04 which is the dumbest thing I may have said on the show and I as soon as I said

00:04:28.22 it I winced and I have not been able to stop thinking about the fact I said

00:04:33.12 dictionary and I couldn't think of I could I was thinking piss boy I was like

00:04:37.09 where should I go with this I need another word off of dictionary and kid

00:04:41.09 came out and uh that's an apology to the audience that I said dictionary because

00:04:46.02 I've been I've got big laughter I've been suffering

00:04:50.01 well maybe you did but I just it was such a lame

00:04:53.09 laughing at not laughing yeah it was a bad it was a bad it was a bad moment I'm

00:04:58.10 typically good under fire but enjoy the next seven days um because that's how

00:05:02.18 long you have until that episode comes out oh great that's fine I'm sure people

00:05:06.23 will be mad but that's okay when you said that's on me I [ __ ] that up when

00:05:11.22 you said dictionary kid it reminded me when you said it

00:05:15.18 it sounded like the name of like a late 60s early 70s Disney made for tv movie

00:05:22.01 and I wanted to bring that up but I uh I said I genuinely winced as soon as I

00:05:27.09 said it and I had thoughts about asking nick to remove it from the edit but I

00:05:31.12 was like that's so bad I just gotta live I gotta live with that

00:05:34.16 as I was thinking piss boy what's something that like is like boy this kid

00:05:38.18 came out it was an unfortunate moment but I'm happy to get past it and I guess

00:05:42.12 I should now talk about how I may have killed somebody which is the point of

00:05:46.11 how to start yeah well before you do that let me just say that that was a

00:05:50.17 that was an extremely regulation apology thank you and and I

00:05:55.05 would like to provide uh I would like to accept it in the most

00:05:58.18 regulation of ways I appreciate that quite a bit um now you're you killed so

00:06:03.11 I'm saying yeah with the candies I brought up recently that I've discovered

00:06:08.21 skittles gummies specifically the wild berry gummies

00:06:11.12 big fan of them I love them I recommended them to a friend he bought

00:06:15.18 a box of 12. He didn't like him as much as me so he just ended up with 10 that

00:06:20.15 he didn't like but I love them I ordered them to my house it's the very first

00:06:25.14 time since I've been here I got robbed somebody I stole my skittles gummies

00:06:31.12 they got left outside of my front door by amazon

00:06:34.02 and they ripped through all of my boxes and I was both upset that they stole the

00:06:38.21 skittle gummies that I was so excited about and then also offended at what

00:06:42.23 they left behind like they I felt judged by the person who robbed me they didn't

00:06:47.20 take the sour patch kids they didn't take the iced tea I bought I was hurt

00:06:53.05 it made me feel like I had bad taste like the person

00:06:57.02 I got robbed you got robbed by potheads [Laughter]

00:07:00.23 they didn't get far they're around somewhere I guarantee you do you think

00:07:06.02 they would have left above real I I think they would have I they would have

00:07:09.15 left everything if the first thing they encountered was the bob roll they just

00:07:12.16 would have left they would determine that the box was not worth stealing from

00:07:16.08 if that was the first item that'd be the

00:07:18.21 ultimate deterrent get all these glitter bombs out of here just do this

00:07:23.05 I would be so mad if I stole a box and it shot bovrel at me I just you can't

00:07:28.10 you're stuck you're just marked it's terrible but I so I stole I was

00:07:33.04 really upset about it and then it came out like two days ago

00:07:37.20 that mars had a massive recall because their skittles gummies contained pieces

00:07:43.08 of metal in them oh and the person that I recommended try

00:07:47.11 the gummies all of their gummy packs were in that order they had to throw

00:07:51.07 away their 10 bags of gummies because they all could possibly come out

00:07:56.02 I'm not sure but there was a recall on them because

00:07:58.19 they contained small pieces of metal apparently

00:08:01.20 and so now I don't know what happened to the person mine could have been filled

00:08:05.11 with metal and someone else stole them and ate them I hope they're okay they

00:08:10.08 could have saved me maybe they're my hero I don't know I'm trans dude that

00:08:14.04 pothead saved your life potentially or I killed a pothead unknowingly

00:08:18.21 same thing one of the two I guess yeah I didn't

00:08:21.14 mean to but two sides of the same coin the the important thing is we're talking

00:08:25.03 to you not them you know what's worse maybe like this is the greatest insight

00:08:29.02 about me I've felt way more dread about the fact that I said dictionary kid than

00:08:34.00 I potentially killed this guy that stole this one accidentally

00:08:38.14 out of your mouth on purpose you know yeah cringe ranks higher than murder on

00:08:44.15 your punches not in all cases and this one it did oh

00:08:48.02 that's been sort of my last few days have have things been for you guys oh

00:08:53.22 good man uh gav have you been uh yeah pretty good I I was just uh

00:08:58.21 I was just feeling a big balloon uh and you you would think that the balloon

00:09:05.09 would be what exploded the hose exploded are you serious yeah did I get hurt

00:09:10.06 no it just exploded now when you say exploded

00:09:13.20 was it exciting exploded or it just like ruptured and it started leaking out the

00:09:20.01 side like what type of explosion are we talking

00:09:24.00 oh he has video oh [ __ ] here we go all

00:09:26.23 right I was like I didn't think that was a tough question let's see okay

00:09:32.19 that's cool that yeah that's certainly an explosion

00:09:38.08 uh that was pretty recent that's about 18 minutes ago

00:09:41.22 how old is that hose uh it was bought yesterday wow so it's clearly had a

00:09:47.11 manufacturer's defect yeah I think there might may have been some metal strands

00:09:52.12 in that hose

00:09:55.01 because it went pop how many hoses do you have it was were

00:09:58.19 you [ __ ] did you have a replacement uh no that was the replacement for a

00:10:04.02 shittier

00:10:11.14 uh yeah but a tight window I just it was the last thing I was expecting yeah I

00:10:17.05 was like looking at the balloon and I heard a pop and suddenly the blue still

00:10:21.08 there very confusing I I think in all the time I've spent in hardware stores

00:10:26.06 and stores in general I don't think I've

00:10:29.03 ever heard anyone frantically buy a hose it's a rare item that people would ever

00:10:32.10 need in an immediate like I couldn't imagine like the fire

00:10:36.13 department running again like yeah the daddy hoes you have any hoes [Laughter]

00:10:41.15 all of ours that feels like such a Michael bay movie moment

00:10:45.11 firefighters using their hoses they explode they have to go to like home

00:10:50.13 hardware or home depot or whatever buy more hoses

00:10:53.18 yeah the reason you use a hose is typically for a very slow

00:10:58.06 problem like my plant is dying very slowly over time suddenly needing one

00:11:02.20 unless you're going to drive away from a

00:11:05.14 fire I want to see somebody fight a fire with a crazy daisy just crazy days in

00:11:09.18 their head and laughing around

00:11:14.02 well Eric wrote that's how I imagined a snake

00:11:18.00 yeah I felt the exact same it looked very snake-like what do you mean I was

00:11:23.12 trying to imagine that I don't know it makes sense right it looks sense yeah

00:11:28.10 like when that when a snake eats a hippo and it's too big and it just works out

00:11:34.13 yeah it gets too far because it's not the beginning of the snake that explodes

00:11:38.12 it gets too far into the snake and that part of the snake is too thin and then

00:11:42.13 the snake just pops and then rolls around for a while it's probably got a

00:11:47.12 weakened tummy from eating all those skittles gummies

00:11:51.09 yeah I was trying to think if like from anaconda because I do agree Gavin it's

00:11:55.21 sort of a weird thought but I feel like I've seen a snake explode in that way in

00:12:00.04 a movie so I was trying to think of like what movie but I don't think it happens

00:12:03.12 in anaconda well I'll tell you what it can't happen enough and I couldn't think

00:12:08.00 any other snake movie doesn't john voigt come back out of the anaconda uh

00:12:12.00 he gets like weirdly eaten I think they just kill the anaconda with an axe I

00:12:16.00 feel like it's kind of lame how they by my memory but I haven't seen

00:12:20.13 that movie in a long time I remember the first time I saw anaconda

00:12:23.16 was that a sleepover at a friend's house it was like a birthday party sleepover

00:12:27.14 and Owen Wilson was in it and I knew who Owen Wilson was from like zoolander and

00:12:31.10 shanghai noon and I assumed he was just always like an a-list actor

00:12:35.13 and I confidently declared that he would survive I'm like oh he's gonna live to

00:12:39.21 the end and he's I think the second guy to die in that movie and I stopped

00:12:44.12 watching and uh there was like clearly something was

00:12:47.16 happening in the movie and I said oh what's going on and then somebody just

00:12:50.20 yelled back to me that guy you said wouldn't die is gonna killed

00:12:54.19 I felt so dumb is that some pretty good deaths what was it the was that movie

00:12:59.00 the haunting where like the fireplace knocks his head off yeah he gets the

00:13:02.09 captain he went through a real ruta desk too like armageddon as well I feel like

00:13:06.02 all those movies kind of came out back to back to back I feel like you have to

00:13:09.13 put in the deaths until you become so beloved that you don't die in movies

00:13:12.23 anymore unless you're Sean bean yeah that's about to say yeah nobody's

00:13:16.08 told champion unless you're just so good at it it becomes a hallmark of

00:13:20.08 performance maybe anaconda could be a next one of our next watches

00:13:24.04 and we still need to do mvp too I've been waiting forever let's do that soon

00:13:28.07 doesn't it seem like snakes should have an achilles heel they don't yeah it's

00:13:33.05 together well yeah but like you know vampires have garlic or crosses and like

00:13:39.19 werewolves have silver bullets or uh slugs have salt right like there should

00:13:45.02 be a thing you could like damp on their head yeah but like

00:13:48.23 you should be able to like throw milk at a snake and it shrivels up no I I agree

00:13:54.15 with Geoff I don't feel like I know what to do in a snake attack yeah like a

00:13:58.06 hip-hop you shove it down a story I feel like don't you hit you hit sharks

00:14:03.05 in the nose right like that's the shark thing like I feel like they killed their

00:14:07.01 achilles okay I didn't even know the gills I think you're supposed to turn a

00:14:10.23 shark upside down I feel like unless you're like James brown and you can

00:14:14.00 split your way well like getting halfway

00:14:15.21 then do the split like I don't know what

00:14:17.23 the move would be yeah is it an eye poke what is it there's a question

00:14:22.10 it's a what what is it what's yeah like you stick your finger in a snake

00:14:26.11 butthole or it paralyzes it maybe if you're in a snake area make sure you

00:14:30.08 always have an umbrella with you just to be ready

00:14:34.10 turn it upside down and rub its belly like a crocodile do six barrel rolls

00:14:41.04 on the inside they all tie it in a knot.

00:14:55.18 I'm imagining being half eaten by a snake and then just rolling down a large

00:15:00.18 hill while it's trying to eat you you're both just falling down the mountainside

00:15:07.14 goddamn hey we uh should we talk about we we there was a decapitation event

00:15:14.02 this weekend I can't believe we haven't brought it up yet what what Owen Wilson

00:15:20.08 what do you mean no we all hung out oh man henry's going at it yeah he is

00:15:25.22 he woke up uh and he found the he found a lot that I did

00:15:30.14 uh we went we hung out this weekend and we went swimming together

00:15:34.22 two weekends in a row with Eric not a water really okay uh yeah went swimming

00:15:39.03 again Eric is so a water guy by the way he's

00:15:41.22 still a water guy he invited everybody to water yeah but I was okay here's the

00:15:46.13 thing I was talking to my small wife about this I

00:15:49.10 was saying that I was on the boat most of the time sometimes in the water

00:15:54.15 sometimes on the big lily pad Geoff was in the water

00:15:58.12 almost 100 of the time we were allowed to be in the water oh my god yes it was

00:16:02.13 crazy I felt like I saw you sometimes and it's only because I had to

00:16:07.04 go to where you were which was in the water

00:16:10.12 I didn't realize that that was the there was a moment where you were on the lily

00:16:15.09 pad but then there were like 12 dudes around it it was like talking

00:16:19.09 to you like you were on a big plate it was that was really funny

00:16:23.20 you were you were the belle of the ball it really was like having a weird harem

00:16:28.17 I didn't I don't think I liked it much but it was good enough

00:16:32.17 uh but we did we we hung out on lake Travis eric's small wife uh rented a

00:16:36.16 like a party boat like a two Decker party boat for eric's uh I guess for

00:16:40.02 your birthday because we got your birthday presents and uh and then we

00:16:43.19 just spent like half a day swimming and there was a lily pad and we brought

00:16:47.23 floaties and we played we went diving and we played games and we threw balls

00:16:52.21 and we had all kinds of fun that's awesome but

00:16:56.12 the guy the captain I say captain lightly because he was like 19. Uh the

00:17:00.02 captain as he was driving us out there he was like y'all want to go to devil's

00:17:03.14 cove that's where everybody usually goes or we could go uh over here a little

00:17:07.15 closer and we were like we don't give a

00:17:09.13 [ __ ] let's go closer and is it empty and

00:17:11.12 he's like yeah there's nobody here so uh we went there because it was empty and

00:17:15.06 and then like we were there for like maybe two hours swimming and having fun

00:17:18.19 and then he gets a radio call on the boat and then he goes you guys never

00:17:22.13 believe this but uh over there devil's cove somebody just got their arm ripped

00:17:26.22 off they had to medivac them out Christ yeah what and uh I feel like we never

00:17:31.11 found out anything else like we didn't find out why they

00:17:34.11 spent the rest of the weekend looking to

00:17:36.05 figure it out and couldn't find anything online about it anywhere that that

00:17:39.23 information has to be delivered with more information has to has to contain

00:17:44.14 more info otherwise why are you telling people

00:17:47.09 I have well I have a theory on this do you think that actually happened or do

00:17:51.02 you think that's that guy's move spice up the trip a little bit injected

00:17:56.08 himself into the party I do think it happened because I think we did see a

00:18:01.07 medevac helicopter going from the area got it however

00:18:03.20 I will agree that it needs to be given with more information because then when

00:18:08.15 we were talking about it a little bit later the captain with his hat over his

00:18:12.19 eyes and his feet kicked up I was going hey Blaine did you hear about that guy's

00:18:16.07 arm who got chopped off we don't know what happened to it I looked at the

00:18:19.08 captain he tilted his hat back and just sort of shrugged at me and then put it

00:18:23.18 back down

00:18:26.21 how far away is the place that you could

00:18:30.14 have went where it happened to where you were then 10 minutes 10 minutes yeah

00:18:35.23 that's [ __ ] crazy that'd be like if you said the neighbors were killed by

00:18:40.04 Freddy krueger or like Jason or some like I'd be so paranoid that whatever

00:18:44.17 ripped that it's okay though it was three blocks away yeah it's what

00:18:49.06 you mean the the thing that just ripped somebody's arm off is still around

00:18:53.17 across the main left you're okay yeah like what are you talking about

00:18:57.13 yeah I would love to know like we were talking about with meg and she she uh

00:19:01.18 uh I guess spent a lot of time on lakes when she was younger and she was saying

00:19:04.21 it happens all the time like uh like I guess that doesn't make

00:19:08.06 colors better like propeller will pop a hand off pretty quickly I guess also

00:19:11.15 like I guess also people get like their arms caught in ropes and then they get

00:19:15.00 pulled and they're just like like oh Jesus yeah if you get your arm

00:19:19.02 like if a rope loops around your arm and

00:19:22.00 then suddenly goes very taut it can ping a limb off I guess yeah oh wow

00:19:26.02 it's one of those things you hear about it's like wow I wonder what they were

00:19:29.05 doing like what crazy thing they were doing I'm sure he was just like a guy

00:19:32.03 with two arms just going on a party boat just like us I'm sure he was just

00:19:36.15 hanging on the beach and a gust of wind came by blew his hand off he blew his

00:19:42.12 hand off that's crazy that was [ __ ]

00:19:45.05 wild and but it was a great time uh well

00:19:47.12 for everybody but that guy that day yeah uh oh and he's probably his the people

00:19:51.01 he was with so I hope he's okay wherever he is I hope they were able to reattach

00:19:54.19 it that's always the hope uh if if you'll indulge me I do have

00:20:00.10 another small story related to a personal track please I'd love to hear

00:20:05.14 that's a weird way to respond to that tragedy statement sorry so this is no

00:20:10.23 this is I would love to entertain you with it uh

00:20:15.04 so on Friday uh I had like a thing fall through and I had a free window on

00:20:19.22 Friday afternoon and Emily was off and she looked at me and she was like

00:20:24.17 seems like a great day to go jet skiing and I was like

00:20:27.12 oh [ __ ] it would be a great time jet skiing and we haven't been jet skiing

00:20:31.19 you know this year so it's probably been

00:20:33.19 I don't know September of last year that I was the last time I went and you know

00:20:37.01 I don't know if you guys remember this but there was a point in time where we

00:20:40.02 were a jet ski podcast and we sold jet ski merchandise because of how into jet

00:20:46.06 skis one of us was well uh I was very excited I was like holy

00:20:50.06 [ __ ] it just like I don't know why I didn't dawn on me that I can still jet

00:20:55.03 ski it was just like uh so we like raced to the jet ski place and uh

00:20:59.13 and by the way uh jet skiing did not get in did not get lamer did not get any

00:21:05.05 less fun if anything it's more fun than I remembered oh my [ __ ] god am I a

00:21:10.04 jet ski guy again I cannot tell you how much [ __ ] fun a

00:21:14.22 jet ski is it is well I mean Gavin you know you were on it once imagine how

00:21:18.10 much fun you had I had that much fun Friday but but more because yeah just

00:21:22.14 keep getting better and again and so anyway we hop on uh lake Austin

00:21:26.17 not like Travis where the guy got his arm lopped off but lake Austin which is

00:21:30.04 much smaller and it takes about takes about two hours to go from one end of

00:21:34.18 lake Austin like from one dam to the other dam and back so you can basically

00:21:40.06 do like a full loop uh if especially if you go about 5052

00:21:44.17 more of a river than a lake yeah for a good period of it and uh it's

00:21:48.11 a lot of fun and so uh the way we typically do it is like I'll ride the

00:21:52.10 first hour we'll take one I'll drive the first hour she'll sit on the back we'll

00:21:57.03 flip and then she'll do the way back or whatever I should also uh

00:22:01.17 just so I can be fair uh I should mention this too my girlfriend

00:22:07.13 has has informed me that she likes swans a normal amount a regular amount

00:22:12.12 she likes swans no more or less than any of you guys like swans she doesn't have

00:22:18.17 a thing for swans she's not way into swans I told this story this weekend I

00:22:23.14 was practicing I told it to some other friends of ours and apparently I I lean

00:22:28.17 too heavy on emily's uh sudden love of swans uh so I'm just

00:22:32.23 on the for the record she likes swans like like a c I guess like whatever the

00:22:38.03 average swan amount is despite the fact despite the fact despite the fact that

00:22:42.13 we just went to London and we were there for a week and there were three things

00:22:46.08 she got excited about she got excited about phantom of the opera uh she got

00:22:50.04 excited about hot pot and she got excited about swans and uh only one of

00:22:55.00 those things is now her her lock screen on her iPhone and I

00:22:58.22 I'm not gonna tell you which one it is but it's not phantom of the opera and

00:23:02.23 it's not a plate of hot pot or a bowl of hot pot

00:23:07.01 uh but she just like swans an average amount however when she was driving and

00:23:12.04 I was on the back about maybe an hour and a half into this she sees a swan and

00:23:16.08 did the jet ski equivalent at 40 miles an hour of slamming on the brakes and a

00:23:22.13 jet ski doesn't go but if it did it would have done it for a long time

00:23:27.04 sees the swan slams on the brakes goes holy [ __ ] look at that swan that I just

00:23:32.07 have a regular amount of affection for and I'm like yeah totally

00:23:36.03 it's a beautiful swan and at this point we're like I'm gonna say 70 fighter 75

00:23:40.18 feet away from the swan I think that's safe it's a pretty good distance but

00:23:44.12 like you know I can see this one it's a big swan and uh and she's like wow that

00:23:48.04 thing is really pretty and I'm like yeah that's pretty and I'm enjoying the

00:23:51.14 majesty of the swan as is she because I also like swans an average amount I

00:23:55.12 don't have it on my lock screen or anything but I do enjoy swans and so

00:23:59.13 we're looking at it and it's just kind of like swanning around to the left a

00:24:02.17 little bit and then it swans over to the

00:24:05.03 right a little bit and it like dips it's a little swan beak not little at all

00:24:08.10 it's giant it's swan beak in the water and like like kind of comes up like uh I

00:24:11.21 don't know like what's her face in fast times original time when she comes out

00:24:16.00 of the water and there's like there's droplets going

00:24:18.08 everywhere and it's just like this beautiful swan and she's really taking

00:24:21.06 in the majesty of the swan and then it kind of turns around and it sees it

00:24:26.23 registers that we exist and you know we're in front of the swan

00:24:30.09 and to the left about 75 feet I'm fully turned around because I'm on the back of

00:24:34.06 this thing emily's like you know between me and the front of the thing and so

00:24:37.12 she's kind of got to look over her shoulder so she's like trying to steal

00:24:40.19 glances of the swan and enjoy its majesty and when it kind of turns around

00:24:44.10 it like it lifts up a little bit and it take it

00:24:47.18 like opens up its swan arms and like all

00:24:50.01 these feathers come out and emily's like oh my god that's beautiful it's showing

00:24:55.03 us it's feathers which I agree it was beautiful but

00:24:58.19 something about it seemed aggressive to me and uh and and I got I don't know

00:25:04.12 something felt off and then so she's kind of like still looking over and you

00:25:07.14 know and the thing is drifting so she's like looking around we're also in the

00:25:10.17 middle of lake Austin there's boats everywhere so as a responsible uh jet

00:25:14.03 ski driver who just slammed on the jet ski brakes in the middle of the water

00:25:16.17 she's like looking around making sure nobody's going to clip us or we're going

00:25:20.02 to hit anybody or any you know we're not in anybody's way and the the swan

00:25:25.15 it made eye contact with me and and you know that scene in uh the

00:25:30.00 episode of always sunny where mac and charlie are are both at the Italian

00:25:34.03 restaurant uh giordino's and they make eye contact and they can't

00:25:38.19 stop looking at each other it keeps like zooming in yeah

00:25:42.21 like the swan and I had that moment and it was unsettling for me right

00:25:46.13 and I was kind of transfixed almost all you know how like Dracula in the maybe

00:25:51.08 not new Dracula but like the old Dracula he would like look at a woman and she

00:25:54.13 would become like transfixed and that's how he would and then he would like you

00:25:57.16 know lay her down in his bed then he would bite her neck I felt a little bit

00:26:00.18 like the the swan was transfixing me like it was just it was just weird right

00:26:05.12 and then this isn't gonna sound real um

00:26:09.03 but it is I've been waiting for this one to attack you the swan

00:26:13.16 cracked its neck like you know like when you're about to get into a fight with

00:26:18.02 somebody and you'll like crack your neck to the right and then

00:26:22.19 roll your shoulders it was like intimidating this one did that what and then

00:26:28.01 I all I can say it was a lot of neck all I could say is it was like

00:26:32.14 I realized that the swan was angry right and I've kind of lost my voice because

00:26:38.08 I'm still transfixed by Dracula swan right and uh and I go Emily go

00:26:43.02 go I think we should go I think I think we should go and she's

00:26:48.10 like huh you know and looking around and and then

00:26:51.16 you know that scene in terminator 2

00:26:53.18 where uh where Robert Patrick pulls them over

00:26:57.01 he's a cop and they realize he's a terminator and they're driving away and

00:27:01.03 he starts running after them with his blade arms and it's incredibly scary

00:27:06.12 because he's going really fast yeah and it's yeah the head's still and

00:27:11.14 it's super like focused and intent uh the swan raised up

00:27:15.23 and then it charged at me like Robert Patrick

00:27:19.11 with it's like half flying half running on the water with its swan arms in front

00:27:24.21 of it just like the terminator and I scream oh my god go

00:27:28.23 we've gotta go you I didn't say go go now or at all at any point I wasn't that

00:27:34.05 I wasn't that clever I was just like Jesus Christ we've got to go and she

00:27:38.06 goes what and then she kind of turns around and sees it I look at her to be

00:27:42.13 like what the [ __ ] and then I see her eyes register I turn back around it has

00:27:48.13 covered the span of 75 feet in less than two seconds when I turn around she

00:27:53.18 starts to go when I turn around to my right I just see a swan arm coming at me

00:27:59.12 so I turn back to my left in time to see the swan cobra strike me in the back

00:28:04.23 right above my butt and to the left of my spine all I can see is feathers and a

00:28:09.06 giant swan face attack me and I get hit and like impact and it like pushes me

00:28:14.13 forward and then Emily guns it and we go

00:28:17.07 probably 200 feet and then she stops and she's like are you okay and I'm like

00:28:22.21 I think so this one bit me this one struck me and I'm looking and she's like

00:28:26.13 are you serious and we're like checking to make sure all of our limbs and stuff

00:28:29.18 are there and we turn around and the swan's still coming at us

00:28:33.03 it's still like it's looking at us and it's like still coming like determined

00:28:36.21 so we got it and we go even further and uh and we just eventually just go it's

00:28:41.22 like we go under the 360 bridge we're like miles away from the smallest point

00:28:46.04 and I'm just [ __ ] shook right and we turned the thing in the guy's like how

00:28:51.12 was it and Emily goes we got attacked by a swan and he goes oh swan got you huh

00:28:56.17 yeah that's a mean son of a [ __ ] and I go you know about the swan and he goes

00:29:02.23 everybody knows about the swan so I guess everybody knew about the swan

00:29:06.15 but us uh I had a bruise where it hit me in the slalom my back I think it's

00:29:11.03 probably gone by now uh and all I could think about for the rest of

00:29:16.04 the day was if that if that swan had knocked me off the jet ski I'm dead

00:29:19.20 like there's no way it would still be on top of you now there's no way I could

00:29:25.03 fight a swan [ __ ] home turf I'd be floating around

00:29:28.06 on my life vest and just be popping me in the head and I couldn't turn around

00:29:31.17 fast enough I would [ __ ] a swan up on land but I was so far away from land I

00:29:36.04 would never have made it it would have picked my eyes out I was like seconds

00:29:39.16 away from dying I'm just imagining that scene in home alone 2 where Marv gets

00:29:45.05 caked in all the birdseed all the pigeons coming

00:29:48.09 that's what it would have been like if you fell off [Laughter]

00:29:54.00 so anyway uh not quite one bit you're back

00:29:58.23 swan bit me dude not quite as dramatic as the whale shark story but just it was

00:30:06.20 terrifying from cbk to Robert Patrick oh my god easily uh

00:30:15.07 are you offended that it's still her lock screen like whatever you see that

00:30:20.11 swan is it doesn't bring back memories no your nemesis is now a swan no no no

00:30:26.04 I'm okay with it I've been assured that Emily likes swans a regular amount and

00:30:32.04 uh totally appropriate so I'm I'm not going to question that anymore oh

00:30:37.11 it's picturing Robert Patrick now with honks [Laughter]

00:30:45.22 I swear to god that swan went 100 miles an hour in

00:30:50.13 point one second it was like it closed that gap of 75 feet in less than three

00:30:56.00 seconds more like two seconds like the time for me to like look back back it

00:31:01.17 was on me it was like it teleported did you think at any point you were

00:31:05.21 gonna have to kill a swan I was no I I'll be honest with you I don't

00:31:10.01 know that I could have like it was huge it had to weigh 300 pounds right it was

00:31:14.15 [ __ ] massive and and I'm at a severe disadvantage in the water yeah

00:31:19.22 like I I just don't I don't even know dude that's where this one's from yeah

00:31:25.14 that's where swans are from how comparable was it to when Larry

00:31:30.07 David got attacked by a swan and curb is it the only thing I'm trying yeah that

00:31:34.05 was the black swan yeah the black swan there's an episode where they kill the

00:31:38.08 the guy that owns the golf course they murder the swan I was wondering as

00:31:42.19 a visual comparison because I feel like it's kind of what you're describing is

00:31:46.07 like that but on land it's immediately what I thought of when you're talking

00:31:50.12 about swans and the possibility of you getting into a swan fight

00:31:53.23 I remember hearing in england that the queen owns all the swans I'm not sure if

00:31:58.19 that's a load of shite or not but I'm pretty sure you can't kill them

00:32:02.18 if they go for you but I think here I don't think the queen's reach

00:32:06.15 I don't think she has a jurisdiction for the American swan so I think I think

00:32:10.10 you're good to murder away okay so uh Eric asked if I'm sure the

00:32:14.18 swan weighed 300 pounds so I looked up how much the swan maze it had to weigh

00:32:20.06 at least 30 pounds at least 30 pounds are like 30 pounds max

00:32:25.13 like 300 what was a it was a when there's a swan on you in the water dude

00:32:30.02 you're not a water guy you're a water adjacent guy it would be way worse for

00:32:33.01 you this one is ten times denser than that

00:32:36.13 swan seemed like a grizzly bear when it was on my back biting me

00:32:40.21 I really want you to try to get like a spit sample from the swan to submit to

00:32:47.04 23 of me to determine where it came from see if you legally are allowed to go

00:32:51.09 fight that swan if it's under the queen's protection or not yeah I wonder

00:32:56.23 if they great jurisdiction wear off

00:33:00.17 so anyway uh drove from there straight to the jet ski store to buy a jet ski

00:33:05.22 you bought one no you guess what the jet ski store didn't have a single jet

00:33:11.18 they had a picture of a jet ski I left very dejected you get a fridge before

00:33:17.11 you get a jet ski so yeah dude afraid of my [ __ ] bike

00:33:21.03 that's how much fun jet skiing is in your mind that you went out you got

00:33:24.12 attacked by a large bird and your instinct was to buy the thing that would

00:33:29.11 let you do that more that was your response 100

00:33:32.12 fantastic yes I love it that that's why I will steer clear of

00:33:37.08 the swan of going forward I will definitely stay the [ __ ] away from swans

00:33:42.01 uh I mean I'll be honest I would have stayed away from the swan had I been

00:33:47.16 driving uh it wasn't my decision uh but uh yeah I think we'll cut a wide

00:33:52.22 swath around the swans the rest of it unbelievable fun oh my god I want a jet

00:33:57.12 ski it's so great that this one has a rep like [ __ ] quint from jaws is

00:34:02.03 gonna be on the dock talking about the swan that's in the water

00:34:06.17 apparently it's a known evil which means it's always around

00:34:11.08 so anybody wants to go see the swan I'll

00:34:14.00 take you all sometime let's just win the jet ski and I know exactly where it is

00:34:18.16 coming this summer honks

00:34:33.01 from so we're referencing a lot of movies today but the scene from psycho

00:34:38.00 with that like just haunt noises

00:34:43.18 somebody should just cut swans and honking into all horror movies

00:34:50.10 that'd be great I don't feel like we've gotten a swan horror movie that I'm

00:34:55.21 aware of we've gone snakes uh we've gone birds

00:34:58.23 not swans was the swan in the birds I haven't smelled birds in a while I don't

00:35:04.16 think there was I saw that groundhog yeah

00:39:40.19 and then before you knew it then we ate lunch and before I knew that it was yeah

00:39:44.00 I'd forgotten you're gonna get back out there and try and take it out

00:39:48.10 I don't want anything to do with it I learned I learned emily's lesson yeah

00:39:54.12 I'm staying away from swans she was fine by the way swan didn't bite

00:39:58.04 her I provided a meat shield for her normal swan viewing

00:40:01.18 that was that's funny because if you were on the shore watching that happen

00:40:06.20 you would be rolling around on the floor

00:40:09.22 laughing at the poor dude came [ __ I oh my god god are you kidding me the

00:40:15.22 funniest thing I've ever seen in my life oh I'm just hoping so much

00:40:20.13 on the on the Austin subreddit someone just posts the security [Music]

00:40:25.15 [Laughter]

00:40:30.23 Security footage like that something like I'm on a tick tock I never know I

00:40:36.08 never knew was recording.

00:40:39.03 I want to see that swan run of 40 based on what you said like we need to get the

00:40:44.00 clocks out we need to time it I want to know where what's this I'm gonna Google

00:40:47.15 swan's max speed it was so funny that's a great

00:40:50.13 last week last week you said you're not a big you're not a jet ski guy like you

00:40:55.12 wouldn't get on it yeah yeah not naturally and now maybe even one

00:40:59.20 maybe even more so now uh I think six months you know this is

00:41:03.05 the problem with what Geoff just said if I was invited to ride on the jet ski I'd

00:41:07.00 never want to be on it out of the possibility I could watch him getting

00:41:11.22 attacked by which is infinitely better I don't care

00:41:14.16 how much fun jet skis are I you could not convince me that it would be more

00:41:18.12 enjoyable than watching you get attacked by a swan but you'd be a criminal you'd

00:41:24.00 get a great view from the other jet ski no I I I don't I don't know I watched

00:41:30.00 him jump over a dead deer once I forgot about that a lot happens on the

00:41:33.18 water man

00:41:36.17 what happens is he stays at sea and nobody thinks that that's getting

00:41:41.00 attacked by a swan like that's never in the list of possible things that could

00:41:45.16 cover I like the guy that's definitely not a jet ski guy is the same guy that

00:41:51.03 wanted us to joust on jet skis I I was co-opting that idea wasn't I I

00:41:55.06 thought Geoff wanted to do a cool high five and then I'd like evolved

00:41:58.23 let's do it because that's that's still in the works we're talking about like

00:42:02.00 jet ski tricks would be and then I think because you had an issue about it being

00:42:07.18 unsafe and so I suggested two two just like poles with a foam hand on

00:42:11.22 the end of each and then you you ride by you do the high five with the joust

00:42:17.15 I also watch it as a sport but [Laughter]

00:42:19.18 that's amazing I would I think I would be radically changed by that experience

00:42:23.18 Geoff I think it would be a marker in my life

00:42:26.12 like when I if I was playing like a trivia game and the question was did

00:42:31.20 this move like what was this movie that came out 2022 starring brad pitt I would

00:42:36.07 then associate was that pre swan bite like it would be a marker for the rest

00:42:41.18 of my life of like how I could define time dude I will admit I was a little

00:42:48.00 like legitimately shook for maybe 45 minutes

00:42:51.02 but by the time I was eating at hula hut with Emily

00:42:54.22 laughing about it I was so [ __ ]

00:42:58.02 excited for today for this moment I was like I cannot wait I cannot wait to tell

00:43:03.09 this [ __ ] story when when regulation animation comes out

00:43:07.05 it's going to be exclusively about you on the water [Laughter]

00:43:11.18 is gonna be so good animated dude I didn't realize I was as much how much of

00:43:17.07 a water guy I was until Eric brought it up but it's true I didn't I didn't go in

00:43:21.01 the water for like a decade but now I guess I'm making up for lost time it is

00:43:25.07 so much [ __ ] fun because you were a surfer before right

00:43:29.14 like I surfed yeah I used to like 20s yeah I guess yeah

00:43:33.21 yeah I [ __ ] love ugh I want to now I go to bar ton springs every weekend right

00:43:37.22 now I go to deep Eddie pool every weekend I need a pool

00:43:41.04 so surfing is one of those things to me that it doesn't look like it should work

00:43:45.00 like I don't understand anything about the physics of it yeah it's very

00:43:50.13 intimidating to look at to be like in my mid 30s

00:43:52.19 and have never surfed and I just watch people surf all the time and I'm like

00:43:56.08 I'm just too late now can't get into surfing now you think so you think

00:44:00.17 you've passed your moment oh yeah I think so why

00:44:03.09 what happened what was the thing that changed I just don't believe in it dude

00:44:07.23 Eric Eric brings up the Eric makes up a good point uh he found out over the I

00:44:13.05 think yesterday we were recording that other podcast I do and uh we found out

00:44:17.01 that gus our mutual friend uh from the day job gus knows how to surf and if you

00:44:22.04 know gush you know he's like the least coordinated human on earth so if gus

00:44:26.23 could surf at all ever you could surf that night you could

00:44:29.12 learn how to surf at 98. You'll be fine gus could surf he could fly he could do

00:44:35.11 weddings he could do everything he's a renaissance man

00:44:38.23 oh man you know what I found out this weekend not everybody knows how to dive

00:44:43.01 I what do you mean I you have to learn how to dive in otherwise you but you

00:44:46.10 have to learn how to swim like like don't you learn how to dive as a part of

00:44:50.23 learning how to swim it's like day three or something no I feel like you jump in

00:44:56.08 first we were on the top of this this double Decker boat and everyone's

00:44:59.23 jumping in and just like going feet first and cannonball and all this stuff

00:45:04.19 Geoff like jumps in the air looks like he touches his toes jack knifes in

00:45:11.01 no splash cool right up back to the top and

00:45:14.15 everything and it's everyone standing on the upper deck going whoa that was

00:45:19.19 awesome that's cool and then Geoff's going everyone knows how to dive what do

00:45:23.16 you mean everyone knows how to dive and nobody knows how to dive what are you

00:45:27.03 talking about blew my mind blew my [ __ ] mind

00:45:30.21 I have a very important was this before or after the swan bite

00:45:35.11 uh this was after this was Sunday swung by so I is it possible that post swan

00:45:40.01 bite you're like 20 more graceful than you were before do you think

00:45:47.22 were you tapping into your new your new connection that you formed I've like had

00:45:53.07 like the swan version of a werewolf now yeah exactly [Laughter]

00:45:57.11 no what was even funnier is uh I I really I I'm honestly I just I

00:46:02.17 remember I learned how to swim at the ymca when I was like eight and I just

00:46:07.16 remember that was a part of it uh so I just assumed everybody

00:46:12.00 everybody else learned how to swim in Oregon in the 80s in the same way I did

00:46:15.12 uh but I will say Emily posted like a video of the day of like of us

00:46:20.12 everybody jumping and diving and stuff and my mom texted me out of the blue and

00:46:24.00 said when did you learn how to dive

00:46:26.15 and I was like are you [ __ ] serious so I guess I was just [ __ ] super

00:46:31.20 ignorant I had no I I apologized to to all the non-divers I really didn't know

00:46:37.16 you dove from the top of the boat through an inner tube

00:46:41.09 yeah and the sand was like yeah it was like perfect it was super

00:46:45.12 impressive oh thank you I tried later on I hit my forehead on it

00:46:52.08 Gavin [ __ ] dive bombed it because anyone can dive if you classify

00:46:58.23 diving as jumping and then going upside down you don't have all the grace

00:47:05.07 you haven't been by swan yet it's not your fault it's true Gavin we can we can

00:47:11.01 here's where we could be bitten by a large boulder I need you to uh

00:47:15.11 follow me on Friday we're going to go on down to the lake we're going to get you

00:47:20.19 bit by a swan by Sunday you're going to be Greg louganis

00:47:24.10 could in all seriousness you need to track that swan down again

00:47:28.13 we need a photo of that I have no fear that I could or no like I I I

00:47:33.02 have a hundred percent certainty I could

00:47:35.18 get back to that swan and it'll be there dude

00:47:37.20 I want to sit on the back of your jet ski facing the other way with a slo-mo

00:47:42.12 camera and it'll be the most epic footage ever

00:47:46.21 yeah oh please 100 we gotta be so good absolutely let's do that very soon

00:47:52.21 do you have a little sli like you don't want to take the I'm sure you don't want

00:47:56.13 to take your phantom out on a jet ski but you have like a smaller hand held

00:47:59.21 uh I mean the smallest one is the one I filmed your bike stunt on oh okay I mean

00:48:04.12 if you want to take it to the middle of lake Austin we can do that

00:48:08.23 yeah Eric I need a large insurance policy from the credit card sure whatever.

00:48:13.21 [Music]

00:48:16.02 We'll wrap it in plastic yeah there you go insurance I guarantee you like that

00:48:21.01 swan will be there and I guarantee you I can get it all I have to do to get this

00:48:25.00 one to come after us is to make look at it

00:48:31.16 oh.

00:48:36.05 [Laughter]

00:48:44.23 How did that guy get his arm cut off again swab fight swan fight

00:48:52.08 yeah I don't think a butterfly net would work but the swan I need I need

00:48:56.00 something bigger I think that's all I've ever heard about swans as a kid is like

00:48:59.18 oh don't mess with a swan they'll break your arm I just don't

00:49:04.08 no I didn't know that they had a finishing move like they [ __ ] knew

00:49:08.04 jiu-jitsu you said that like they throw you in the arm bars and that's because

00:49:13.11 what are you talking about yeah it's just like hello everyone

00:49:18.12 all kids hear about and then they just move that information on to the next

00:49:22.15 person like oh yeah yeah swan will break your arm does anyone see the swan break

00:49:28.02 anyone's arm if it's 30 pounds do you small I'll look that up spikes

00:49:32.22 breakups do swans break 60 miles an hour it might

00:49:36.08 do swans break if you approach a swan nest on the river holy [ __ ] imagine

00:49:41.11 accidentally going into the swan nest this is terrifying

00:49:45.05 comment leave is if you're if you're a regulation listener about to turn or if

00:49:49.20 you're a regulation comment leaver oh wait a normal comment what uh let me

00:49:53.16 know if you've had a comment later let me know if you've seen this one break

00:49:56.16 anyone's arm or if you've had it has has a swan ever attacked you did it break

00:50:00.18 your arm then sprain your ankle anything let us know

00:50:03.20 they might get aggressive and hiss and flap their wings but the danger is

00:50:07.08 overrated and it's a myth that they will break your leg or arm with their wings

00:50:12.06 they are not that strong and it's mostly show and bluster yeah somebody

00:50:16.14 somebody tell that somebody tell that to the [ __ ] terror of lake Austin.

00:50:24.12 I think we should go out there find this one and not come home until after until

00:50:30.10 Geoff's mom is broken

00:50:35.03 oh man you became the guy it goes full circle there's somebody

00:50:39.18 else on the water that gets told about some weird arm break that was removed

00:50:44.23 and you have no context for you could be the guy that could be you dude speaking

00:50:50.12 of [ __ ] dumb guys there was a story and this lake there was a story that

00:50:55.16 happened uh like maybe four or five months ago Eric and nick and Gavin may

00:51:00.20 have heard this although I doubt Gavin has because he doesn't hear much

00:51:04.12 but uh what's happening this dude uh I just I don't think he was like plugged

00:51:08.14 into like local america like like Austin [ __ ] maybe oh it doesn't concern me

00:51:13.12 you're more international exactly see so

00:51:15.20 we have this thing called the 360 bridge it's like it looks like a I don't know

00:51:19.12 like a mini golden gate bridge well not really it's like a it's a half circle uh

00:51:24.06 but it's like our version of a nice bridge it goes right over lake Austin uh

00:51:28.18 it's actually where sometimes we ju we go in with the jet skis depending on

00:51:33.07 where they're putting in that day uh uh and it is

00:51:35.22 at the very top uh from the very very top of the del like of the of the

00:51:40.09 circular part of the bridge I guess like the aesthetic part of the bridge

00:51:45.09 uh it is eight feet shorter than the golden gate bridge and so

00:51:49.19 it's incredibly dangerous to jump off of because as you know the golden gate

00:51:53.05 bridge you'll die if you jump off of it and uh apparently that eight feet makes

00:51:57.07 a big difference some [ __ ] like 22 year old dude or

00:52:00.00 some young dude in Austin climbed up there as a prank and filmed it I think

00:52:03.22 it was even on Instagram yeah there's the bridge and the photos

00:52:07.12 he climbed up to the top of that and uh filmed himself jumping off and he didn't

00:52:12.00 die he almost died I think that eight feet saved his life they were saying but

00:52:15.12 he did like get a concussion and crack his head open and he needed I think some

00:52:19.02 kind of [ __ ] brain surgery and stuff like it was a whole thing and they were

00:52:23.07 interviewing him and oh yeah I seen nick heard about this

00:52:25.23 they were interviewing him uh for like the statesman or whatever afterward and

00:52:29.07 they asked them in the hospital like well do you have any messages to anybody

00:52:33.09 else that may try something like this and he goes keep following your dreams.

00:52:38.17 [Laughter]

00:52:41.14 Well I guess he had a lot of time for a lot of them while his head was cracked

00:52:46.03 open yeah no kidding uh keep following your dreams I laugh

00:52:50.13 about that every time I see that bridge now uh posted his quote

00:52:54.10 oh I did not mean to go and jump off a bridge I have a big [ __ ] ego and I

00:52:57.18 know I'm capable of hopefully there's been motivation not by me jumping off of

00:53:01.03 a bridge to show off and say to the same but you find something within you that

00:53:04.23 motivates you go chase after your own dreams like he's a [ __ ] hero like he's

00:53:10.00 inspired he's inspired a nation by almost dying

00:53:13.19 there he is oh my god the neck brace oh um by the way the the [ __ ] uh swan is

00:53:19.18 like the distance from the bridge to the end

00:53:22.19 of the photo that much further right is where the swan is

00:53:26.23 it's pretty clear it's pretty close to that location in that that's exciting

00:53:32.05 I can't wait for the swan update yeah we have enough locations now for a face

00:53:38.12 tour book like a guidebook go to the swan you can walk through the

00:53:44.00 snake bushes and find baseballs the [ __ ] like face guide to Austin yeah

00:53:49.00 it's like those not for tourist guides like usually the real Austin his way

00:53:53.20 is where you get pushed off your bike by the gentle ghost

00:53:58.10 here's where you can do a sweet bike trick [Laughter]

00:54:02.15 and here's where bean holes don't work.

00:54:06.23 [Music]

00:54:08.04 Oh Christ so we had a conversation about how

00:54:15.09 we've talked about the anal passage shirt so much we need to put it to bed

00:54:20.00 we need yeah we agreed before so many so many consecutive episodes I did I got

00:54:26.00 my anal passage shirt though and I had a realization when I was

00:54:29.19 looking at it something pieced together in my mind and I can't unsee it now and

00:54:34.21 I'm hoping it will do the same for you have you

00:54:38.01 noticed the giant dick on the anal passage shirt no

00:54:41.14 let me post it let's picture I'm gonna I can't believe I'm about to Google anal

00:54:46.11 passage oh that's not yeah that's not so here's here's the logo do you see the

00:54:51.08 dick yet oh at the top the cockpit the top yeah it's a dick with [ __ ] balls

00:54:56.04 that's all I see now is that the original like Eric said that was the

00:54:59.20 universal logo I believe so just you know in case in case you missed it I did

00:55:03.09 a nice little circle for you there really focus in

00:55:07.05 taking balls every time I see that now that's all I see digging balls

00:55:10.22 oh yeah universal studios Hollywood has the dick and balls oh my god I'm taking

00:55:16.04 balls that's amazing by the way don't Google uh anal passage

00:55:20.06 don't Google image search anal passage face

00:55:23.07 oh ain't no passage dick and bulls is probably not it does not

00:55:28.00 does that get you where you want to go I just I didn't I'm glad you you both saw

00:55:31.10 it because I didn't know because I had the same thing with the sl when slack

00:55:35.05 changed its logo and I I didn't feel I feel like I didn't really hear many

00:55:39.11 other people talk about it all I see is four dicks and balls pointed in every

00:55:43.04 direction ready to go that's all I see it's all I've ever seen

00:55:47.18 and ever whenever I look at the slack app it's just like four dicks covering

00:55:52.12 all angles oh that's old hash mark new four dicks

00:55:57.03 coming at you from all sides like it's only one bowl though perky ball well

00:56:01.22 it's a profile photo it's a sign it's a profile yeah oh oh yeah yeah yeah

00:56:08.08 oh sorry that's awful I was worried that when I showed the

00:56:14.21 the the the anal passage dick that I I would be the only one that

00:56:19.07 saw it because I knew it was like a slack thing but I'm glad that you saw it

00:56:23.19 or are you gonna say gab oh I don't know uh oh so what were you talking about

00:56:28.16 which one if we're trying to successfully put this shirt to bed but

00:56:31.22 it's too successful to do so well we're not throwing I just meant like us

00:56:36.08 talking about it just like because we've brought it up so many times it's like

00:56:40.04 yeah like this week's episode aired and everybody was talking about it so I

00:56:43.13 wouldn't listen to it and then nick posted next week's episode and I started

00:56:47.11 to proof that and we start talking about

00:56:49.05 it like in the first five minutes and so as I was being funny when I came into

00:56:52.19 pleasantries I said hey can we agree not to talk about the anal passage shirt

00:56:55.18 this week because it's been like five weeks in a row and then Andrew goes I

00:56:59.07 have something to say about it I had the same thought at the exact same but it's

00:57:04.04 just this last insight so now on the uh on the four dicks and balls app someone

00:57:08.18 in a in merch said well originally they were sort of posting updates as we were

00:57:13.02 climbing towards the top of the shirt list we were like at number three and

00:57:16.12 then number two and now the update was we're stomping on the grave of the

00:57:20.04 number two shirt in terms of how many shirts we've

00:57:24.20 solved have an amazing community we do it's so good

00:57:29.22 oh it's just the most amazing I haven't actually asked I haven't talked to jack

00:57:35.01 properly about how he really feels about it I feel like

00:57:38.12 we've gotten a good read from Geoff yeah he's had enough time now that he'll

00:57:42.09 he'll be okay uh I'm sure I hope so I gotta [ __ ] go to Florida with him in

00:57:45.07 two days [Laughter]

00:57:47.11 you're not recording one of these for like a while what yeah well

00:57:52.03 you know you know how we're currently doing a show and not just hanging out

00:59:32.12 would you let me tow you on a jet ski I'd in what context what are we doing

00:59:37.09 here am I in like a little am I in a floaty boat thing like

00:59:41.22 an inner tube you're in an inflatable swan

00:59:45.09 I would not if we're in swan territory I do not trust you in the inner tube no

00:59:51.04 uh if it got if I'm not I love you Gavin

00:59:53.18 if things got real with that swan you're cutting that rope you're leaving me

00:59:58.17 behind I don't trust it I don't think I would cut

01:00:02.21 I I think it smells like we're climbing if I if if it was between the phantom or

01:00:08.23 me I'm getting left in the water I'm uh I'm absolutely planning on buying

01:00:14.06 one of these from my jet ski when I buy a jet ski

01:00:18.06 I have those all the time Austin people are [ __ ] having a blast on them you

01:00:22.18 give me some some pepperoni sticks it's called a great big Mabel and if since

01:00:26.23 it's an audio podcast and it's a uh it's like an inflatable sofa dude eric's

01:00:31.01 water adjacent that is very adjacent for him Eric would love that and he would

01:00:34.17 love a bunch of dudes like leaning on it around as he was on top I just think

01:00:38.12 that I could definitely put a cooler on that thing and have a bunch of drinks

01:00:43.01 while I listen to sublime while sitting on the great big Mabel 100

01:00:46.09 if you give me some pepperoni sticks and two butterfly nets I'm ready to go into

01:00:49.23 swan territory with that setup I like there's enough room to move around I'm

01:00:54.10 prepared I need one for each arm then I'm ready

01:00:57.16 all right so we're gonna that's how you guys want to break your arm

01:01:01.20 we're gonna do this that's gonna happen I will buy a jet ski I will buy a great

01:01:07.22 big Mabel Andrew will come to Austin at some point so it will have to happen

01:01:12.15 I am so nervous this is going from outside of the realm of uh like a funny

01:01:17.12 uh potential to I want lately let's let's [ __ ] put pen to paper and let's

01:01:21.22 cement this let's do let's get this done I'm willing to do the hard part and buy

01:01:26.00 the jet ski uh yeah I'm in okay I'm in I can't wait for this I can't wait to see

01:01:30.05 you guys get attacked I can't wait to go into swan territory myself

01:01:34.02 it's gonna be a great time I think if you're on an inflatable swan

01:01:38.23 it will make this one made way more aggressive or what if you could

01:01:44.02 dude what if you could make a swan fall in love with you

01:01:48.09 what if you could transfix this one what if it looks at you and oh [ __ ]

01:01:53.04 that's the most gorgeous swan I've ever seen what if we bring a mirror

01:01:57.20 what would it do would it just rush at itself what would be the process

01:02:02.00 would it psych itself out we need to bring a giant mirror

01:02:05.04 that's that's you're just asking for trouble that giant swan inflatable is

01:02:09.22 that Photoshop that's none of that that's a hundred percent of Photoshop a

01:02:15.14 single piece of that photo is ready that's the green co giant inflatable

01:02:19.05 swan pool float lounger it didn't 75 inches it's a bacon dude I think if

01:02:24.07 we went fast enough on the jet ski we could get that thing to take off oh 100

01:02:30.06 you mean get it airborne oh hold on don't worry I found a better one

01:02:35.07 what if we go the other route what if we intimidate the swan

01:02:39.04 because we're in this

01:02:44.02 this one is the size of my house look at the

01:02:47.05 crown the queen definitely owns that one big there are

01:02:51.16 was it five people six people on that swan with room to spare [Music]

01:02:58.23 I love this how that's gonna be like a thousand dollars uh that's the

01:03:06.04 nine-foot crown wearing swan this one banging its head on a bridge Ella from

01:03:13.01 sam's club uh you can get it right now holds up to

01:03:17.07 six people hold on it's on sam's club uh like the snacks membership place yeah

01:03:48.05 will we'll figure it out

01:03:53.05 that could be us I never would have thought that we would have a swan attack

01:03:58.07 episode with Geoff but I'm glad we did what a great time I'm glad you're a

01:04:03.12 water guy Geoff as Gavin said you've brought so much great content to the

01:04:08.04 show by purely being you thanks man well I I am looking forward

01:04:12.21 to continuing water and water act uh uh related activities so uh hopefully I'll

01:04:17.01 have tons of new stories non-snake related stories to tell

01:04:21.03 I can handle just about anything else in the water just no snakes yeah all right

01:04:25.15 what about an octopus uh I don't think I have to worry about

01:04:28.04 that in lake Austin I think I'm probably safe from octopi so specifically the

01:04:32.09 animals in that lake it's not all animals outside of snakes you feel

01:04:37.03 confident taking uh I mean I've spent a lot of time in the ocean and I've never

01:04:42.17 really worried about octopi uh before uh maybe if I was like a like a deep sea

01:04:46.13 fisherman I'd be afraid of like a giant prehistoric octopus like ripping my my

01:04:50.23 boat apart but like close to shore I think I'm probably fine I think I got

01:04:56.10 chased by an octopus once in the water I got chase [ __ ] gross

01:04:59.17 what is that oh it's Eric posted a it's a snake inflatable snake inflatable yes

01:05:05.04 that looks like Eric it does that's me intimidating the other snakes [Laughter]

01:05:13.16 it but it's like it's close but different it's like Hollywood Eric

01:05:18.00 like if there was an abc family movie that featured Eric as a character in it

01:05:23.09 and they hired an actor to play Eric that is

01:05:26.11 absolutely Eric but a little cleaned up yeah a little bit a little cleaned up

01:05:31.09 it's pretty accurate
