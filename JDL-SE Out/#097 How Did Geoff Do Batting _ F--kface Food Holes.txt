00:02:33.07 credit card yeah okay yeah I'll get the credit card for the show

00:02:37.20 oh henry's starting off early today too he's also excited to ask my question

00:02:41.20 because I feel like we're gonna drift away and it's it's only it's really

00:02:46.08 tight it's tied to the intro okay specific part of why did we stop

00:02:51.12 numbering the episodes of the show what we didn't I

00:02:54.19 this is the episode 97 I just said it no I know but if you look at it on podcast

00:02:59.04 apps we number up the 43 I think and then the numbers stopped I thought we

00:03:03.02 did the number at first and I was campaigning for the numbers and then the

00:03:06.01 numbers came in are you saying the numbers have gone again oh the numbers

00:03:10.06 have been gone since 43 from what I could tell no

00:03:13.01 I'm pretty sure I was looking at least on Google podcast on their app we go to

00:03:17.12 43 and it's just it's just the name who's in charge of that nick or Eric I

00:03:22.21 don't know yeah nick yeah [Laughter]

00:03:28.23 nick just typed Jesus what I'm just like why I was just curious

00:03:35.09 I also I'm looking at them they're numbered on apple so I don't

00:03:41.09 tell you they're not numbered on YouTube let me look at let me let me pull up my

00:03:46.18 I don't want to I could be wrong so face yeah they're numbered on apple on

00:03:51.12 on Google on the Google podcast which was okay they're not they're not here

00:03:56.13 that's why today I found out Google has a podcast thing yeah

00:04:04.17 of the animated thing and I've been trying to source what episodes came from

00:04:10.01 where and it's a nightmare beyond 43 but I'll

00:04:13.12 switch to apple I'll make it a lot easier yeah who came up with a name for

00:04:16.11 it have we announced the name I don't think we have I don't even think we've

00:04:19.20 announced that we're doing an animated series I don't think we've gotten past

00:04:25.07 early tests and animatics all right that it's even gonna be a viable thing

00:04:30.19 okay whatever might well why don't you go ahead and name it

00:04:34.19 so people can ask for it when it never shows up maybe you should be announcing

00:04:37.23 it in a nice trailer or something like a house we've already announced this what

00:04:42.19 I've already talked about in the most face way

00:04:46.16 ever we're we've announced it on the show now and now you're going maybe we

00:04:51.14 should announce it a different way that's not gonna

00:04:55.07 we've announced it like a week ago it's already come out us talking about

00:04:59.11 it I feel like two weeks ago there was that I think it's as nick said I think I

00:05:03.21 talked about already I think I asked in the episode can I talk about it you're

00:05:07.12 like yeah gathered for a couple months ago wasn't it because I said it was

00:05:08.23 quite a while ago even so Gavin you've been keeping everybody in suspense for a

00:05:13.16 month you came up with the name why don't you say what it is I would say it

00:05:17.20 was in collaboration with Eric but we've decided on face regulation animation.

00:05:24.18 [Music]

00:05:29.22 Yeah that's a fantastic name I absolutely love it didn't didn't want to

00:05:33.11 take any credit away from Eric didn't realize it was like it was a combo

00:05:38.10 naming congratulations to both of you uh I think it's a great name I'm uh I'm

00:05:44.13 all about it yeah I I we cannot use the word when appropriate

00:05:47.15 you we can you cannot overuse the word regulation it's a regulation word

00:05:52.19 it's a great word it's a great regulation word what's the regulation amount of

00:05:57.19 regulations per episode uh I mean it's it's purely

00:06:01.23 conversationally dependent you know yeah I'm talking about foreign

00:06:06.10 there might be episodes where the word's not appropriate at all although I would

00:06:10.16 find that hard to believe that's fair hey so we got three big things to talk

00:06:15.07 about today and I want to make sure we get through all of them uh one uh I know

00:06:20.17 everybody remember well first off uh there was a bean hole we need to discuss

00:06:25.16 that I'm so excited I have been actively avoiding any infections so busy

00:06:29.16 the bean hole saga has been completed and I saw there was some confusion I

00:06:33.20 think a lot now of course I'm talking to the audience from three weeks ago

00:06:37.07 because we're recording in advance but a lot of people were looking for that

00:06:40.17 little video teaser that we watched in the episode we only released the some

00:06:43.21 some images of it because we want to cut a full video together that's probably

00:06:47.18 out by now uh but now three weeks later you'll understand why we didn't do it uh

00:06:52.11 and stop uh complaining that it's not on the

00:06:56.10 Instagram uh so we got a the completed the completed bean hole saga we have uh

00:07:01.21 Geoff uh signing the 350 baseballs and uh of course this is the unveiling

00:07:09.14 of all of our cup ideas that we were going to agree to come back with oh as

00:07:15.06 somebody who has actively avoided the the bean hole and the signing thing the

00:07:19.14 fact that you described it as you I believe it's the first time you've

00:07:23.04 described it as you signing the baseballs and not hitting the baseballs

00:07:28.02 which has me worried okay well I'll tell you what uh

00:07:32.02 of those three things I'll let y'all pick what do we want to talk about first

00:07:35.12 well baseball is something I've been working on uh all morning a little clip

00:07:39.17 for you Andrew oh let's build let's build up to that then you don't have any

00:07:43.15 clips of bean hole do you uh why are we building what are we building for

00:07:48.13 visual aids I mean I think we should show how to do the video

00:07:52.21 I want to see the video okay well before we do that

00:07:56.04 Andrew what are you doing no no this is part of it uh Andrew before we do that

00:08:00.10 let me ask you a question uh you know the the the premise of this if you're if

00:08:04.23 you're if you're new to face if you're not uh deep into the lore of nothing

00:08:09.05 uh then then what was what was proposed was that I signed a baseball bat

00:08:14.02 backwards uh well it burned my signature into a baseball bat uh backwards dipped

00:08:18.19 it in paint and was going to autograph 350 baseballs by having them shot at me

00:08:23.20 via a pitching machine and then me hitting him

00:08:27.17 Andrew let me ask you how do you think that went

00:08:31.16 oh horrible it was never going to work it's a disastrous idea it was just

00:08:35.16 where do you think the breakdown was was

00:08:38.19 it my ability to hit a ball was it my uh decrepit age

00:08:42.23 was it just a flawed concept from the start

00:08:45.04 oh it's the fly got some from the start the bat would never that's not how bats

00:08:49.09 work it would never what you did makes no difference to anything it just would

00:08:53.08 be smeared paint on a ball it would do nothing your signature would not be

00:08:57.08 legible we've known this from the start uh okay it's not a surprise so you think

00:09:01.17 that the signature didn't work but I probably was really good at hitting a

00:09:05.12 baseball then or I think you're capable of hitting a baseball I don't think

00:09:09.12 you're gonna hit 350 in an afternoon how

00:09:12.10 many do you think I could have hit in an afternoon uh I bet you hit

00:09:17.01 I I would put the line at like 30. At most uh well I'll say this why don't we

00:09:23.07 refer to exhibit a yeah okay here we go oh ready Geoff is in okay I'm Geoff is in

00:09:28.10 baseball he's lighting up he's at the plate okay all right I'm gonna count down

00:09:32.16 no go ahead Andrew go ahead it it just looks like you've pined hard your bat

00:09:36.18 the entire way that doesn't look like a thing I've dipped it in a bucket

00:09:41.22 of black house paper really thick house paint I've got tall

00:09:45.21 I've got Larry bird socks on my oldest vans a baseball uniform I've got a don

00:09:51.12 zimmer shirt on under and my uh my kind lady kitty hat yes

00:09:55.12 not gonna sound nick that's nick sorry by the way nick is there nick and Eric

00:10:01.07 and Gavin were all present and this is super fan jack made an

00:10:06.07 appearance eventually oh that's great this is gonna sound like it's an insult

00:10:10.23 and I don't I don't mean it to be Geoff this is a very strange photo because

00:10:15.09 from like the hips up it looks like somebody who

00:10:18.12 knows baseball but from the hips down it looks so out of it

00:10:22.17 nothing about your footing or the way you're standing it looks like you're

00:10:25.22 very uncomfortable but wasting weight looks great I will tell you this I am a

00:10:30.00 little uncomfortable because there are that is a

00:10:32.16 that it's just holes holes in the ground I'm trying to stand around

00:10:36.19 now you can see my back foot is my heel of my back foot is like three

00:10:40.22 inches lower than the top of my foot I have a question for Gavin before you saw

00:10:45.12 this paint and you've been visualizing this process in your mind what color did

00:10:50.11 you always see being used I'm curious if you had one I had a very consistent in

00:10:54.10 my head what this would look like I was I think I was expecting something a bit

00:10:58.12 more fluorescent like orange or something I was thinking red in my head

00:11:02.04 it was always red paint that you'd be using

00:11:05.14 I'm pretty sure it was anything other than black for me well

00:11:09.07 let me say this about the paint uh Eric bought the paint I didn't choose the

00:11:12.08 color but the color's fine I thought it was okay yeah I can't believe anybody

00:11:16.08 thought anything other than black one of the colors for this show

00:11:20.07 yeah I I it makes total sense Eric I just wasn't yeah it's fair visualizing

00:11:23.17 that at all yeah my visualization has always been red and like avid said I

00:11:27.10 don't know why it's just where my brain has always been well well do you guys

00:11:31.16 want to see the I Gavin sent me this and said play it for everyone I have not

00:11:36.03 watched this so oh I'm so excited together it's about a minute long yes

00:11:40.17 okay all right here we go will this be on the Instagram I'm gonna make it yeah

00:11:45.22 something will be there okay okay here we go

00:11:53.07 nothing's even happened I'm already happy oh Jesus oh no oh no no oh no.

00:12:10.02 [Applause]

00:12:15.03 [Laughter]

00:12:22.13 Over and over.

00:12:27.09 [Laughter]

00:12:34.10 I've never seen anyone be so bad at anything oh my god he hit it

00:12:41.01 we're gonna sell one baseball that's what I've learned

00:12:45.12 I see what you've done there Gavin

00:12:52.17 what do you mean Geoff no nothing go right ahead continue on.

00:13:02.15 I thought that was great that's cool fantastic

00:13:08.10 why don't you tell them what else happened Geoff

00:13:14.04 I've prepared a second video okay thank you

00:13:18.19 okay god this better be a real video it's gonna be a minute I have to

00:13:24.06 download it

00:13:27.20 and it's two gigs why didn't he send me both

00:13:35.18 Geoff I thought you looked I thought you looked great taking all those swings

00:13:41.04 there bud thanks man yeah hang on about halfway almost there I

00:13:46.04 don't I was well I was laughing hard I was kind of making fun of you and your

00:13:52.02 defense it's impossible to look good missing at a baseball swing like this is

00:13:56.21 not your fault this is not there's no way to look cool during that

00:14:00.15 so for those uh for those who haven't seen it and are only listening I cut

00:14:05.01 together every single Geoff swing and miss that I could find and put it as one

00:14:10.02 honestly so many of them look like they're repeat shots but they're all

00:14:14.07 completely different to the point where like the bat is swinging around in one

00:14:18.04 shot and then it cuts to the next shot and it's swinging the other way it kind

00:14:21.18 of looks like a little helicopter

00:14:24.02 how many swings and some of those were foul tips but how many swings and misses

00:14:28.05 would you say uh I need to do the full count I'll be

00:14:32.08 able to get that when I finish the full uh the full thing

00:14:35.03 well if those are just the misses I feel like you have greatly exceeded my

00:14:39.16 expectations are you ready for this second video I am I already certainly am

00:14:43.20 I'm hoping I'm going to see some bankers Geoff you don't want to watch that first

00:14:47.01 video one more time just like I'm good I'm good that first video was very funny

00:14:51.11 would you have been mad if that's the only video

00:14:53.16 I would have I might have been a little bummed yeah

00:14:57.11 all right this is a way less funny way more surprising video

00:15:02.12 you wanna give it a try this is the first ball the very first pitch there we go

00:15:17.09 that was great great contact you hit a home run yeah yeah [Applause]

00:15:35.16 I feel like this is contributing to the the problems of the other video

00:15:41.11 you're going full power like look at this there's no cut here legit oh wait

00:15:47.07 so this is that was a home run

00:15:51.22 there was people every once in a while I'm not lying

00:15:57.11 Geoff like it's the strangest thing he has the least graceful form

00:16:02.08 nothing about the swing looks impressive but it's just flying back to back

00:16:10.15 let's have a question it's just still this is this is

00:16:16.00 I apologize you some good get some good swings

00:16:29.03 wow this is you hit a lot of balls be careful

00:16:33.07 we got to the point where we had people just standing outside of the field at

00:16:38.12 the back because most of them were going into the trees

00:16:42.04 as you just say we need to sell these like the backdrop looks like it just goes

00:16:47.22 nowhere like off a cliff yeah we lost so many

00:16:55.07 is it so what is the backdrop of this place is it is it as it appears that it

00:17:00.09 just like is a hillside yeah it's like a hillside kind of like canyon almost it

00:17:05.09 just goes down into like brush and bramble look at that.

00:17:12.21 I think god and this is Geoff looking for the balls

00:17:18.00 the biggest problem we had on the day is that I hit too many home runs too far

00:17:24.23 and we lost probably 20 balls I next time I'm in Austin I want to try

00:17:29.18 to find one okay I want to go there I want to see if I can get one I would

00:17:35.18 guess you saw me miss about 40 swings out of I'll be I'll be honest with you I

00:17:39.07 didn't hit 350 balls I hit 250 and I stopped wow yeah that's way better than

00:17:44.09 I thought 250 proved to be uh that was my limit of the 250 I would say I

00:17:49.12 connected uh I I fully connected on probably 70 of

00:17:53.14 them on the first time first try uh you saw every time I missed in the

00:17:58.02 first video I would say I would guess I probably hit 50 home runs

00:18:02.21 and we decided that we would box up a ball if he swinged or swung and missed

00:18:08.06 but not if he didn't swing so he either hit it or he swung and missed and that's

00:18:12.15 what we're selling so we're only selling the ones he missed

00:18:15.12 yeah like if he didn't go for the swing we just put it back into the rotation to

00:18:21.01 pitch again hang on hang on hang on the wording of that is weird if

00:18:25.18 if Geoff swung the bat at the ball that ball is being sold whether it was

00:18:31.02 connected with nothing or not okay understood we I hit every ball

00:18:35.17 eventually uh the ones that we swung and missed we we went we we I hit it again

00:18:42.08 okay so that is all answered is there a photo of what a signature

00:18:47.12 looks like with this this bat paint idea I'd like to see what a ball

00:18:52.10 after being hit appeared like uh I don't have one do you guys

00:18:56.21 hang on if you give me a second I think that I can send you a picture

00:19:01.16 okay I'll I'm I'm leaving the stream okay I'll go back no no you know what I

00:19:05.08 can I can slack it it's gonna be easier if I slack it to you guys okay um it's

00:19:09.17 looking slack because that is the other layer of this like beyond you being able

00:19:14.00 to hit I'm very impressed Geoff that you hit as many as you did that's amazing

00:19:19.09 I'm curious what the signature actually looks like uh

00:19:22.01 it looks like well I guess Eric will show you it looks pretty much like what

00:19:27.18 you expect it to look like I've sent the pictures now oh okay yes

00:19:32.04 this is black smudges which is great awesome awesome so what there was Geoff's

00:19:37.20 official signature what did you do to the bat what did I do to it yeah

00:19:43.18 what do you mean like what was your what's the word you did on the bat that

00:19:48.00 was meant to end up on the ball oh I burned my name into it so that there was

00:19:53.21 one ball we found that had a g on it [Laughter]

00:19:57.05 one of the earlier one of the early balls had had an actual

00:20:01.11 g on it somebody will get it it'll be theirs but we've worked out afterwards

00:20:05.14 that you've burned into the bat yes yes so the only way it could be a g is if it

00:20:11.09 was an inverse g no I burned it in backwards on the bat

00:20:14.06 so that it would be correct on the ball no but it's sunken into the back it's

00:20:18.23 not sticking out yeah but what I was doing early on is I was

00:20:22.03 dipping it and then I was I was uh wiping down the barrel so that the only

00:20:27.18 paint that was on the bat was in the reservoirs of the g of my name hey

00:20:31.12 Andrew when you when you looked at that bat and you said boy it looks like you

00:20:35.15 rub pine tar all over that thing did it look like the only paint on that bat

00:20:39.19 were in the reservoirs of this well that that's because that went out the window

00:20:44.04 very quickly that but further but that when

00:20:48.05 it worked with the first like four balls then I was just then I was just trying

00:20:52.18 to sling as much paint on them as possible and I thought it looked way

00:20:56.10 cooler to have a big black smudge or anything else

00:20:58.19 I know like the the mlb has changed their pine tar rules over time I don't

00:21:02.18 think there was ever a time in which that amount of pythar would be

00:21:05.13 acceptable for the coverage of the bat like it was it was bottom to top just

00:21:10.15 coated yeah I look like trey turner right uh

00:21:13.15 dude I was hoping that Gavin was gonna accuse you of corking the bat when he

00:21:17.14 was asking about he doesn't know what's cooking the batteries yeah I don't I

00:21:21.09 don't know what that means Andrew I'm sorry [Laughter]

00:21:25.11 uh we were all very surprised and I think I don't I can't tell if Geoff was

00:21:30.05 strolling out there with confidence or whether he was just hoping

00:21:33.20 uh what do you think it was Geoff were you just relieved or were you like oh I

00:21:38.12 knew I was gonna do that uh I'll be honest with you guys I

00:21:42.00 I have that level of confidence in all this stuff I still think I can throw I

00:21:46.06 still think I can throw the ball 80

00:21:46.23 miles an hour I wouldn't have said it if

00:21:49.02 I didn't think I could do it my body has gotten in the way but uh the thing that

00:21:52.23 was that I realized I don't know if we talked about this on

00:21:56.08 the podcast or not but I'm 46 I hadn't hit a baseball with a baseball bat since

00:22:01.03 I was 17.

00:22:02.09 And so it's been 29 years in my head I could still hit like I was 17.

00:22:07.05 Uh and it turns out I could I I was still labeled I would say my

00:22:12.15 batting average on the day was probably 750 which is astronomical uh again the

00:22:18.00 pitching machine was only pitching 45

00:22:20.19 but I mean that's about as fast as I can throw

00:22:24.01 uh and uh at the moment and I and I I probably knocked out 40 or 50 home runs

00:22:29.12 I felt really really good about that that first video that first video oh man

00:22:35.02 you really got me with that one [Laughter]

00:22:38.08 boy did you but uh but out of 200 and I hit 250

00:22:41.20 balls that day we probably lost 2020 of the home runs that we just couldn't get

00:22:46.15 to uh how did I feel the next day Eric asked um but no Andrew I was I was

00:22:52.21 relieved I was super relieved that it that I that I didn't embarrass myself I

00:22:58.04 felt vindicated because there were about 10 people that went out there purely to

00:23:03.20 watch me fall on my face including my girlfriend including her parents who

00:23:09.05 were in from Oregon uh including super fan jack and Cole and a

00:23:13.07 bunch of eric's friends and I went out and first pitched put one over the field

00:23:18.10 and then proceeded to do it 50 more times uh so I felt like I felt good

00:23:23.12 about myself for once that was nice now to answer eric's

00:23:27.02 question uh how did I feel about the next day or how did I feel the next day

00:23:33.01 uh I I today is the first day I haven't limped.

00:23:37.20 I could I had Monday was hell it was excruciating oh no my hip

00:23:45.16 my right hip where I was swinging it was on fire my legs hurt my elbows hurt my

00:23:52.15 back hurt uh my my shoulders hurt not all of that though

00:23:58.10 paled in comparison to my hands which were just I don't know if you've

00:24:04.12 ever bruised the palms of your hands I guess I had not it's certainly not to

00:24:10.06 this extent my right hand was black uh on the padding and I

00:24:15.14 both of my hands are the entirety of the

00:24:19.15 inside of my hands hurt so bad that just touching them was excruciating I I by

00:24:24.22 the way [ __ ] glass let me get back to that I was

00:24:28.21 in the bathroom and I picked up a glass to get some laundry detergent from this

00:24:33.06 thing and my hand just immediately dropped it and shattered it everywhere

00:24:38.17 and I couldn't hold the broom because I couldn't hold the broom with

00:24:43.14 my hands to sweep it up it hurts so if it was

00:24:47.22 it hurts I mean that surely is not the glass's fault my hands are fine now but

00:24:53.03 my fault finger I had no tensile strength my

00:24:56.04 finger I could barely drive it was hard to put my hands around the steering

00:25:00.22 wheel for until yesterday my hands started to feel better yesterday today

00:25:04.01 they're fine you took your glove off on the day and you had like a big fat

00:25:08.23 forearm and wrist like it would already oh yeah

00:25:11.02 and my left wrist would swole up insane that was crazy but I hit 250 [ __ ]

00:25:16.21 baseballs swinging as hard as I could so I guess uh

00:25:19.06 yeah I apologize if you've covered how long were you guys out there how long

00:25:24.02 did this take a couple hours two hours maybe yeah

00:25:27.02 probably about two I really thought it was gonna take I thought it was gonna

00:25:30.14 take us four or five hours to do this because I thought there were gonna be a

00:25:35.20 lot of breaks Geoff took maybe two breaks and that was mostly to

00:25:40.13 give the outfielders a break from just standing in the sun watching 200-foot

00:25:46.04 bombs fly over their heads you uh once you once asked me in a

00:25:50.12 podcast earlier Eric how far I thought I could hit the ball and I said I thought

00:25:55.03 I could hit it about 200 feet and you laughed at me

00:25:58.03 um I think 200 feet's about my range though oh you cr you were crushing of

00:26:02.05 200 consistently like back to backers where they were going like the same spot

00:26:07.09 I bet even people at the car show were impressed what the [ __ ]

00:26:13.18 [Laughter]

00:26:20.02 So this is the park where we play all the time like me and my friends the guys

00:26:25.18 who came out Jordan swears and Cole and a few other people and

00:26:28.17 every time we go out it's a big empty park and we go to the baseball field

00:26:32.01 it's a big empty baseball field I show up Sunday morning to start

00:26:36.13 getting set up before everyone gets there and it is just it's a Andrew it's

00:26:41.22 a car show like a like a tricked out like

00:26:44.19 it's a car it's like a full-on car show and I almost had a panic attack

00:26:50.10 uh I just I pulled my 90 like my 2007 hyundai

00:26:55.16 accent up to this car show where I usually park to go to baseball and the

00:27:00.19 guy just looked at me and went you're I don't think you're supposed to be here

00:27:04.23 and I went I don't think I am either but can I unload my stuff and then park

00:27:08.19 anywhere else yeah that's fine there's just a car show a lot of people

00:27:13.19 at this car show on a Sunday morning so weird yeah with like the bonnets up big

00:27:18.12 tricked out rims like big purple hummers with art on like 19 speakers hanging at

00:27:22.17 the back like that kind of thing and then we're just getting dropped off in

00:27:27.09 normal cars and they're very confused about it

00:27:30.05 it made me so excited because I've been actively avoiding all info about this

00:27:34.12 because I want to hear from the first time on the show the only thing I saw

00:27:38.03 relating to this was Eric posted a map and a group text of where to go and it

00:27:43.12 looked like reconnaissance from like a military movie

00:27:47.10 it's like a Google maps top-down view and there's lines like the fact it

00:27:50.22 seemed like a whole mission just to get there and I was immediately it just

00:27:54.14 furthered the excitement this is great I'm so glad that this

00:27:58.04 finally came together when are we gonna sell the baseballs do we have a date for

00:28:01.12 that yet I don't know but I would like uh they were supposed to pick them up

00:28:04.23 this was uh uh econ was supposed to pick them up this week and they haven't done

00:28:08.12 it yet but I got 250 baseballs and by the way we have another 100

00:28:12.08 baseballs that we haven't like we just didn't even open the final box so we can

00:28:15.17 hit them with another color of paint or maybe have Gavin hit them or and come up

00:28:19.18 with some we got 100 baseballs to [ __ ]

00:28:21.15 with in some way okay or sell them pristine if we want but I feel like we

00:28:24.18 could do I feel like I feel like what we've done here is very fun and very

00:28:28.06 clever and very and I think people will really like it we should say that

00:28:31.15 there's not just a signature on these balls the way the pitching machine

00:28:35.05 worked I realized was just a spinning tire inside that red thing so they all

00:28:39.17 have a skid mark on them too yeah and there's also a lot of grass

00:28:46.06 how many seconds into that first video did you realize that I had uh screwed

00:28:51.14 with you uh second well the second at-bat so immediately yeah immediately

00:29:02.02 man I will say uh I don't know why I haven't been hitting

00:29:05.22 baseballs for the last 29 years it is a ton of [ __ ] fun and I had never hit a

00:29:11.07 pitching machine before holy [ __ ] those things were great is that going to be

00:29:14.18 your new hobby now are you just going to be in batting cases yeah but not it not

00:29:18.18 I'm going to I'll do like 50 not 250.

00:29:21.11 Yeah you're not you're mobilized.

00:33:13.14 a cure for swelling and just general hip pain because I'm assuming it sounded

00:33:18.19 like before those were back to back endeavors they were we went we went

00:33:22.17 straight to the beans and I've not yet prepared the uh

00:33:26.13 the bean video but I do have two pictures from it that I think sum it

00:33:32.02 up quite nicely oh I'm so excited so it's been a long day or two hours at

00:33:35.16 least sweating hot out Texas swinging at baseballs you come home for the

00:33:42.13 so guess

00:33:50.08 oh.

00:33:58.12 [Laughter]

00:34:03.12 Two photos.

00:34:18.10 I can't believe there was a time in which I was sad I missed the beats.

00:34:27.11 [Laughter]

00:34:34.15 Well how many people came over for the pieces

00:34:37.22 just nick and Eric and Gavin oh oh it was a very exclusive it was just it was

00:34:43.09 limited to the face well yeah her parents

00:34:48.10 uh who emily's dad was so sweet he had two helpings I don't know why what yeah

00:34:54.02 you ate these yeah all right Gavin did too that's right so

00:35:00.20 uh it was a day of it was a contrasting day of highs and lows uh I think that

00:35:06.06 the baseball thing couldn't have gone better biggest vindication of my adult

00:35:12.17 life uh it turns out I am uh I'm uh I'm I should be back and clean up for

00:35:18.12 the dodgers uh and then uh but probably not cooking for them the

00:35:24.06 bean hole was a disaster an unmitigated disaster not only

00:35:28.23 not only did it come out of the ground looking like that uh

00:35:33.01 they were undercooked and lukewarm at best

00:35:39.20 at one point we went to the hall where we just buried all the ashes the day

00:35:44.02 before and I put my hand on the ground and I was like oh it's a bit warm and

00:35:49.11 then Eric was like is it warm because of the fire or warm

00:35:53.00 because the sun is on it and I just put my hand on a different piece of the yard

00:35:58.12 that had the sun on it and I was like it's because the sun's on it

00:36:02.23 was absolutely no heat coming from underground whatsoever it's clear to me that

00:36:09.09 I'll be honest I was pretty demoralized I actually haven't moved that that

00:36:14.13 that uh dutch oven of beans from that spot it's still sitting there

00:36:19.16 I'm just avoiding my backyard can you quickly take a photo of what the

00:36:23.18 beats look like now can we get a beat update yeah I'll go outside in a second

00:36:27.06 and do it I'll go outside if I can do it oh my god they definitely didn't fully

00:36:31.16 cook uh clearly the fire went out early I

00:36:34.16 don't know if we didn't put enough coals in there or they're I don't know we

00:36:37.18 gotta we gotta go back to the beach back to the drawing board you didn't have

00:36:41.04 enough space to put it coals in your one

00:36:43.15 foot hole dude it was so hot Gavin and I could barely get them in it was so hot

00:36:48.05 right because it's one foot off the ground I was just hearing whether we

00:36:52.11 should have left like an air chimney to keep yeah

00:36:55.17 the embers alive but it I think in all the videos it just says completely bury

00:37:00.15 it all yeah it's so weird um so clearly we have to do it again uh

00:37:05.08 because while we were eating the beans and we all ate the beans

00:37:09.12 we realized that we that we should make a cookbook

00:37:12.21 face cooks the food and we can have our be our perfected bean hole recipe in

00:37:17.22 there and what was the other recipe well we wanted to use the uh the pizza

00:37:22.21 oven oh yeah never touched gavin's gonna make pizza in my pizza oven and we're

00:37:28.03 gonna come up with a face pizza recipe Andrew can make it we can put Andrew's

00:37:33.03 salad in there Andrew did you know Geoff has a fully massive proper outdoor pizza

00:37:37.14 oven and he's seeing this now and he doesn't use it he's never used it that I

00:37:41.21 mean that checks out that feels like a thing you know why why it's right behind

00:37:46.13 me in that photo uh there's a spider in it

00:37:49.00 so I'm gonna go in there pest control I'm going to burn out all the wildlife

00:37:52.17 and then I can't I can't do this oh my god why why is that just why

00:38:00.17 why is that the reason well I also don't know I don't know how

00:38:04.19 to make pizza in a pizza yeah that's fine but it's icky it's like icky in

00:38:09.16 there I'll clean it out I'll clean it out all right

00:38:13.03 gavin's gonna and that's gonna be and we're gonna and we're gonna illustrate I

00:38:16.23 was even thinking we could use the illustrations from uh the ani the face

00:38:21.20 regulation animation show uh and so we could have really well illustrated uh

00:38:25.19 complicated cooks because like the bean hole it's not easy it's not for the

00:38:28.23 faint of heart but when we get it perfected it's gonna go right in the

00:38:32.19 book dude sunderland's pizza boom face just became so much work all at once

00:38:36.06 I've got I'm editing like multiple videos in the face universe I'm cleaning

00:38:40.03 buckets of house paint off the front of my camera I'm trying to buy a new leg

00:38:45.20 for my tripod because oh as soon as as soon as one ball whizzed

00:38:49.12 right by my camera Andrew the game completely changed for Geoff he was no

00:38:53.10 longer going for the ball signing no he was trying his absolute hardest to wreck

00:38:59.12 my camera with benzo you know that's a good point I probably

00:39:03.14 could have hit more home runs but for the last

00:39:06.03 I would say the last half of the day I was trying purely to kill gamer gavin's

00:39:10.10 game and I did I did take out his tripod it's

00:39:13.18 true and I've and I've looked into replacement parts because I don't really

00:39:18.02 want to he you basically bent one leg but it's really just one like telescopic

00:39:23.05 segment of one leg and I looked it up they're 45 dollars per segment so I

00:39:27.08 think I just replace it with two I'm just glad you didn't hit the lens you

00:39:32.21 painted the lens but I tried so hard and you know if I would

00:39:36.11 have hit that lens I wouldn't have felt bad at all I was rude no I know you

00:39:39.18 would have cheered and I would have been I would have had to congratulate you

00:39:43.16 because I chose to put it there yeah yeah you would have hit the lens we'd only

00:39:47.17 have one video [Laughter]

00:39:49.18 the leg got hit and then it was like oh man it won't even close and then it was

00:39:54.21 Gavin when we were done trying to close it

00:39:58.08 until eventually he did get it closed and then couldn't

00:40:02.17 get it back open because it's bent and then it just broke off yeah I think I

00:40:08.14 think by shoving I was trying to bend it back and I shoved the leg in and now

00:40:11.20 it's permanently stuck in so now I feel like I'm actually going to have to

00:40:15.16 replace the entire leg instead of just removing that bent in section I'll just

00:40:20.04 send me the send me the thing and I'll buy it happy now Jesus Christ

00:40:25.01 it was defending from laughing so hard it was a very eventful weekend

00:40:30.13 it was a huge face weekend and that was it was sad that you weren't there Andrew

00:40:34.15 we actually talked about we wanted to conference call you in on the bean hole

00:40:38.08 but then we didn't want to spoil anything for you yeah we wanted your

00:40:42.04 reaction for the episode but also it made me just super excited for

00:40:45.11 our first Canada trip because oh that's another thing we're gonna

00:40:48.16 we're gonna make we're gonna have a crab leg recipe because we're gonna make our

00:40:52.06 we're gonna go crabbing and then we'll have a cra face cooks the food we'll

00:40:56.19 have crabs and pizza and beans and Andrews salads and hot dogs

00:41:01.05 you want to make ramen you want to make ramen and a keurig andrew's got the

00:41:06.01 recipe can we make a hot dog hole can we figure out a way to do this we

00:41:10.05 can totally make a hot dog hole would we just drink hole drill little individual

00:41:15.04 holes

00:41:16.23 that's that's a funny idea I was thinking just putting them in a giant pot

00:41:21.18 like boiling like water boil like hot dogs like that

00:41:25.00 type of style there's no way it'll work but it can't be worse than the beans

00:41:28.20 the bar is already even set so low flavor-wise I feel like we're fine they

00:41:32.11 just tasted a little bit like uh room temperature day old baked beans that

00:41:37.12 weren't fully cooked yeah but nobody's nobody gets sick

00:41:41.12 that's true I was I was pretty gassy because I had two full bowls but

00:41:46.04 didn't throw up nick said they weren't that bad they

00:41:48.17 weren't but they weren't that good either and they definitely looked like

00:41:52.06 [ __ ]

00:41:53.17 [Laughter]

00:41:55.03 When you took the lid off they looked so

00:41:58.13 sort of pale brown it was a weird such a

00:42:01.19 color it was such a letdown after such a successful day hitting home runs

00:42:07.05 like I went from home runs to striking out [ __ ] hard on beans oh my god but

00:42:12.21 uh I'm gonna get over it and I'm gonna I'm gonna we're gonna go back to the

00:42:16.08 drawing board we're gonna improve the whole we're gonna improve the process

00:42:19.19 and we're gonna figure it out and that's what making a cookbook is all about is

00:42:23.20 like figuring out the perfect so the recipe that nobody else has managed to

00:42:27.21 get right oh maybe I should buy a jackhammer of some sort that's not a bad

00:42:32.19 idea to get deeper through the rocks yeah I my mind went pickaxe I like that

00:42:37.06 you've gone all the way to the jackhammer I feel like you've you

00:42:41.14 couldn't there couldn't be a larger jump between just a literal hammer to a

00:42:46.11 jackhammer being your next tool look if we're going to start cooking

00:42:50.06 stuff in the ground more we're going to need the tools

00:42:53.20 we're going to start cooking stuff in the ground water it's an untapped market

00:43:00.04 we cook exclusively underground oh man so there you go uh hitting the baseballs

00:43:05.12 huge success uh signature it's it's cool it may not look like my name

00:43:11.14 but it looks like something and uh bean hole

00:43:14.19 uh to be continued uh Angie I would argue the bean hole couldn't be more

00:43:19.12 successful it was everything I would want from the bean hole if we could

00:43:24.09 we can dig in public we could have a little sign people come oh my gosh

00:43:29.18 it would be my hubby's hole my hubby's hole

00:43:33.19 oh I watched the uh I don't my hubby's bagels they were Instagram living last

00:43:38.02 night I watched them give a little tour of their facility they're very good

00:43:41.08 they're they're so sweet yeah they're really awesome I can't wait I can't wait

00:43:46.04 to get their shop opens in like a week I can't wait to buy

00:43:48.20 I think they're they're at like 250

00:43:51.12 something followers on twitter which is very funny 315.

00:43:54.18 That's amazing it's uh fantastic it's gonna become our official hangout spot

00:43:58.13 in in uh Canada absolutely I'm so excited it looks great maybe you should

00:44:01.17 go there when it opens and give a little bagel review video

00:44:05.11 oh I'm absolutely gonna buy them as soon as it opens for sure review I I mean

00:44:10.04 it's I'm not going to promise that maybe I mean you're a bagel guy

00:44:14.19 I'm a bagel guy here's the thing though I'm not going to commit to this because

00:44:18.08 if I don't post a review I didn't like the bagels I see so if I did like if

00:44:22.08 there's no review then people will assume I didn't like maybe so I'm not

00:44:25.18 going to say maybe I will maybe I'll definitely talk about this account we'll

00:44:29.07 just unfollow it randomly but it'll be like it never happened no

00:44:33.07 no I can't wait to try their food I just before we go too far Gavin said if we

00:44:38.08 get good at it we can do this in public places do you really think that like if

00:44:42.22 if somebody walks by and is like why are you doing this say don't worry I'm an

00:44:48.10 expert like solves any of the issues that would cause being in public like

00:44:51.21 what does our skill level or proficiency have to do with publicly doing it well

00:44:56.05 just because it's like it'll be like a food trailer but it'll be just like no

00:45:00.03 it's not though we can't just dig a hole

00:45:02.12 in a park guys and be like we're good at

00:45:05.11 this if you replace your divots I'm sure it's funny

00:45:08.17 this is even better than caffeinated soup which we still got to make by the

00:45:12.16 way I still think cabbage this is a phenomenal establishment no

00:45:16.08 our caffeinated soup does not exist that stuff you showed me a little bit like

00:45:19.20 dog that's fair it wasn't it wasn't specifically it wasn't like chicken

00:45:23.21 of whole beans we're gonna introduce you like

00:45:27.01 the whole world was lousy with food trailers for a couple of years right and

00:45:30.03 then everybody got anal worms and then they all had went to brick and mortars

00:45:35.05 but we the next iteration who needs the truck we've got the ground food holes

00:45:39.01 come on over to face food hole and we'll dig up whatever you want we could do

00:45:42.20 like a luau have a buried pig we could have buried hot dogs

00:45:56.04 that's what I was gonna say kind of there's a zero percent chance anyone

00:46:01.11 does like this is gonna apply to anyone that listens to the show if you own a

00:46:05.00 golf course and don't mind us [ __ ] up a green it'd be so funny to dig a hole

00:46:09.19 on a green and just watch people trying to golf like dealing with the fact that

00:46:14.05 we're taking a creeping whole on the green like just completely [ __ ] up their

00:46:18.23 game if there's anyone that's cool with that please let us know

00:46:22.12 that'll be a very funny video and if you're not cool

00:46:25.02 if you're not cool with that mate what about a sand trap could we do it in the

00:46:28.02 sandpaper next to the green well you know golf clubs are notoriously easy going

00:46:32.21 yeah that's true chill relaxed people that

00:46:36.07 are tolerant to all sorts of groups I saw caddyshack one and two it's just ant

00:46:40.23 wow you're really committed yeah maybe um maybe a future rtx we can have a bean

00:46:45.21 hole I would love that I would love that well I mean people can come on down to

00:46:49.13 our our our food hole space and then get in line and buy it like everybody else

00:46:54.02 we're gonna be the hottest thing in Austin like the veracruz tacos but in

00:46:57.22 the ground I just uh this is these uh there's so

00:47:02.01 many great possibilities of food underground and why are we doing this

00:47:06.05 all underground because Geoff read an article once that apparently it was very

00:47:11.12 good yeah that's right it's it's a rich part of my American heritage

00:47:16.07 I'll be honest I was so surprised at both things like I was actually

00:47:19.22 expecting good things from the bean hole and I was expecting dog [ __ ] from the

00:47:24.17 my entire Saturday was just turned upside down or Sunday this was Sunday

00:47:29.15 it was very unexpected I was I couldn't believe the beans didn't work out

00:47:33.23 yeah me too man me too that's the most believable thing I've ever heard this is

00:47:37.19 shocking to me did you not see the whole you made the

00:47:40.16 whole you're part of the whole making process it was like it was kind of one

00:47:44.15 chance it was a whole lot zero this is zero percent chance

00:47:48.15 I will say the look on all of your faces after about my 15th home run that uh

00:47:54.05 that made that made all the bean failure

00:47:56.13 worth it but man I wanted those beans to I wanted them to look like in the

00:48:00.08 YouTube videos I watch they look so good in those videos

00:48:03.22 where would you rank let's say if the beans were perfect Geoff you have the

00:48:07.17 perfect bean day you have an amazing baseball day where would that day of

00:48:11.09 ranked in your all-time greatest days uh

00:48:13.09 probably the top three top three hundred percent easily top three yeah top top

00:48:17.17 three and only because I have to reserve like millie's birth for one of those

00:48:22.21 days and absolutely yes definitely top three

00:48:26.23 if none of my family is listening to this podcast maybe best day of my life

00:48:33.14 it was funny watching like the surprise and the cheering at the beginning to the

00:48:39.01 just people standing there just like watching them sail over one time hitting

00:48:43.18 trees it was almost like a downer for everyone else but Geoff was just

00:48:49.01 absolutely knocking them it's fun baseball's fun

00:48:52.18 uh so when we've sold all these balls uh there's almost certainly at least 10

00:48:57.07 still back there so feel free to go oh I can't wait to get one um

00:49:01.20 be careful it is snake country back there oh [ __ ]

00:49:05.07 I was I went back there like I am going

00:49:08.19 to go find my home runs [ __ ] this and I

00:49:10.18 I was back there about 30 seconds to win oh no okay I get it

00:49:15.09 I understand why Cole doesn't want to Cole and Jordan don't want to tromp

00:49:18.11 through this I uh yeah it's pretty sketchy okay well that that just

00:49:23.06 changed the whole game yeah I was all excited you ever

00:49:26.13 like collect golf balls that were shot yeah that was always fun yeah I loved

00:49:29.17 doing that when I was younger but I had a friend who lived on film with snakes I

00:49:32.21 had a friend who lived on a golf course when I was in Florida so I'd go over to

00:49:36.13 his house on like on a Saturday and we would go [ __ ] just go nuts collecting

00:49:41.14 golf balls that's great yeah he lived on the golf course yeah yeah yeah

00:49:45.18 a lot of a lot of like a lot of people do yeah there's a lot of houses on

00:49:50.15 perimeters golf courses oh I assume he's not in the middle

00:49:53.13 between hole seven and eight no yeah he he operates the food hole over at the in

00:49:58.05 the sand trap at 17th hole it's like a [ __ ] mini golf course he lived in the

00:50:03.12 lighthouse his bed his bathroom was in the giant whale yeah

00:50:09.11 no it was like a golf community and they were just like on the edge of the golf

00:50:13.22 course yeah he's a nice kid that's great

00:50:16.15 yeah I don't remember his name would he I remember enjoying him

00:50:20.16 would he is he do you think he'd be an enthusiast of cups how do you think he

00:50:24.09 would fall oh dude that's a great point that's an excellent transition I think

00:50:28.02 he would be excited about cup and cup theory uh Andrew do you uh do you have

00:50:32.13 do you have your do you have your cup do you want to we

00:50:35.09 so to catch the audience up we we determined that glass is dog [ __ ] and

00:50:39.19 people shouldn't own it especially near their mouths it's just a

00:50:43.18 recipe for death uh and so we decided to design the

00:50:47.16 perfect plastic cup uh and then hopefully go into production in it so

00:50:51.06 that we can help revolutionize the world

00:50:53.10 save people's teeth and save people with sore hands from hitting

00:50:57.17 a couple hundred baseballs from dropping glasses left and right and smashing

00:51:01.18 their feet in the ground a recipe for death would actually be a

00:51:05.00 perfect name for our cookbook

00:51:07.07 circle back to it yeah um yeah I have well I think we're all

00:51:11.09 supposed to do a blueprint under your guidance of the perfect cup I have mine

00:51:16.17 I don't know if the two of you had time I did Gavin you have your drawing uh

00:51:23.09 listen he was very busy with the videos I'll be honest there were two reasons I

00:51:28.23 was busy editing two videos at the same time and also uh we talked about this in

00:51:33.07 the lost episode which is always between the one that came out and the one we're

00:51:36.18 recording so uh yeah completely forgot about it absolutely uh in one ear out

00:51:41.07 the other that one yeah no that's fair I I remembered it I woke up at five a.m

00:51:45.20 for a moment and it thought cups and then went back to bed

00:51:51.05 so I too put this in last minute I'll submit mine we can talk about mine

00:51:55.14 because I feel like um I went against direction Geoff you asked

00:51:59.09 for something simple okay which is fair I understand that but it was the perfect

00:52:03.17 cup so I wanted to illustrate in my head what I think the perfect cup is and I'd

00:52:08.06 love to hear your guys's suggestions and how you generally feel about it

00:52:12.09 this is the gurpler uh we're gonna have to get it because some of the

00:52:16.12 illustration is gonna be tough to uh tough to

00:52:18.14 oh I post it in the [ __ ] I'm in slack for some reason let me go to discord

00:52:23.20 whoops okay here we go oh my god oh my god so we got the gurpler

00:52:28.13 I understand this is a complicated thing to decipher so we're going to go piece

00:52:34.08 by piece for it uh um so we got what does that look like to you Geoff it looks

00:52:42.02 it looks like a mon a bat monster with one tooth

00:52:47.03 it looks like a Venus flytrap with a rash

00:52:54.10 so it's very tough to convey when you have ideas for both the top of the cup

00:53:00.00 and the bottom and the side it's tough to like get the angle of like try to

00:53:04.12 display in a 2d in a flat scenario yeah yeah so we're going to lose that

00:53:09.00 so we're going to start it's an angle that doesn't actually exist so what

00:53:13.07 you're looking at at the very top first of all that one the lines in the circle

00:53:17.19 non-euclidean cup are you talking about the barbed wire around the edge

00:53:21.16 the barbed wire around the edge with the lines coming out of it that's a little

00:53:25.05 parachute we have a little parachute on top of the glass in the event that you

00:53:29.11 drop the glass it will just softly float down because

00:53:33.10 to me the perfect cup as somebody who knocks over a lot of cups the perfect

00:53:37.20 cup is a cup that can be covered in any scenario and you maintain at least we're

00:53:42.12 gonna do a fifty percent beverage guarantee that you will not lose more

00:53:47.05 than half of your drink so if you are if you're using it outside

00:53:52.15 on a windy day see you later we're not done there's no protection

00:53:55.17 mechanisms built into this thing so we got a little parachute on the top now

00:53:59.16 what's in the circle you're looking at the top

00:54:02.19 of the glass you see that little tooth yeah you said yeah that is a piece of

00:54:06.16 plastic that you would spin around like a full circle and that would seal the

00:54:10.23 top of the glass just so you're safe you don't have to worry about so if it tips

00:54:14.19 over there's a lock in place oh like I said I think I see it's a spin it's a

00:54:19.05 spinning like mechanism like you just grab the top of it and you tilt it and

00:54:22.16 the whole thing would like spiral out and fully cover the glass and

00:54:26.14 like lock in okay on the other side knows what you mean I have absolutely no

00:54:30.21 idea what you're talking about so you know like when you fan a deck of cards

00:54:35.18 yeah yeah it's like that but it's so that's the base part and you'd fan it

00:54:39.10 across the top of the glass that's cool so that's the idea so because you don't

00:54:43.04 want it fully fanned because you need to fill the glass so it needs to just be a

00:54:46.09 small piece that you could fan out once it's locked in yeah there's a little

00:54:49.21 hole below that on the side for your straw this would be a straw designed uh

00:54:54.05 product okay have a straw there then you have all the edges shooting out

00:54:58.16 the side that is in the event that you knock over the glass and you do not have

00:55:02.12 the top sealed if there's not falling if the parachute

00:55:05.14 can't help if you're just on a counter and you knock it over those will prevent

00:55:09.15 it from going fully flat that will keep it at an angle you're going to lose some

00:55:13.11 beverage but we're maintaining a 50

00:55:15.11 beverage guarantee with these little arms on the side just to carry it but if

00:55:18.21 the parachute covered kick in from counter height when would the parachute

00:55:23.02 be useful well no I think it would from counter

00:55:25.23 height but sometimes you knock a cup over and it doesn't fall it lands on the

00:55:29.16 counter yeah so this is a scenario in which it

00:55:32.12 doesn't it doesn't go past the counter it just gets caught on it so it's got

00:55:36.12 your cover that's got like guard wings yeah yeah yeah essentially

00:55:40.02 it's like gardening it's a great way garden wings is we're going to trademark

00:55:43.18 that garden we've got guard wings all over it makes sense what does it say in

00:55:45.16 the middle iron hole what does this say that you've like scribbled it oh that

00:55:50.08 was straw hole oh yeah and then I decided to color it in um

00:55:54.05 so then then the last part and this is the key part and this is more just fun

00:55:58.23 because you want a glass to be fun four tiny retractable wheels on the bottom

00:56:04.00 because you never like if you're at a table like from someone's like oh

00:56:09.12 like yeah like little hot wheels wheels so it's just you know I'm having I'm

00:56:13.01 enjoying myself a nice frozen pineapple lemonade right now if we were at a table

00:56:18.04 and was like hey I want to try that just pop the glass down the wheels come out

00:56:21.21 and I just push it over don't have to get up not the move don't

00:56:24.11 have to do anything it just slides across you see those scenes at the bar where

00:56:28.11 like they throw the glass down that's always seemed dangerous I don't trust

00:56:31.20 that gotta put some wheels on that the wheels it'll go even further and

00:56:36.04 then you just push it down the wheels go back up it's like landing gear

00:56:40.00 it's gonna be tracked up into the liquid uh they retract into so there'd be kind

00:56:43.20 of a thicker part of the bottom of the glass that it would retract into there

00:56:48.23 would not be there'd be like a space between

00:56:51.02 it would not go into the liquid now is it dishwasher safe it is dishwasher safe

00:56:56.15 of course it is the parachute as well uh

00:56:58.22 we're you know we got to look into that I'm not sure I'm not sure about that

00:57:02.04 process that we got to narrow down the material to use it for the parachute but

00:57:06.17 outside of the cup itself maybe we could sell multiple parachutes

00:57:10.01 we could do fun little designs in the you can up sell that's a great that's it

00:57:14.02 yes yeah exactly so what when that is drinking out of it does the parachute

00:57:18.04 just hang down by the glass uh yeah yeah the parachute just hangs just a little

00:57:21.20 hang will hang off the back but the straw is on the opposite side so you

00:57:25.12 have to worry about the parachute no straw is included

00:57:30.15 you're gonna have to buy that in pen I'm impressed I think that's a great design

00:57:35.08 it's uh it is the option everything I'd want a cup the opposite of what I'd

00:57:40.12 envisioned but I love it I thought I I appreciate the ingenuity uh you've

00:57:44.13 you've definitely added a lot to to to the cup

00:57:47.23 um love to know what that means what is the opposite of that cup so I'll show

00:57:53.05 you it's uh it's it is it is it it I mean if it had a if it had a usb port

00:57:59.11 it would be perfect [Laughter]

00:58:02.23 that way you can you could be a smart cup and you could

00:58:07.13 keep data on like how cold your beverage usually is how many how far affect how

00:58:12.18 far have you seen those usb distances traveled all that stuff usb fridge

00:58:17.16 there's like a usb it's a usb there it's a [ __ ] product that like works but

00:58:22.17 it's pointless it's like a little usb fridge that can chill one drink that's

00:58:26.19 what makes this cup solar powered cup with a usb in it you plug the usb fridge

00:58:31.04 into the cup you put the cup in the fridge it freezes it's uh this is genius

00:58:34.19 Geoff this is a great idea about you well I love it I think it's great I

00:58:39.14 would love to uh get a prototype built out

00:58:43.03 I don't know I don't know if you're up up for that what's the name of it

00:58:48.15 the garbling the the guppler okay just straight up gurpler it's gonna

00:58:52.12 the name came before the cup the the name is non-negotiable it's the gurpler

00:58:56.05 no matter what they're all the final form of the cup is yeah it's it's a girl

00:58:59.21 regardless so what's yours oh uh yeah let me show you mine I'm a

00:59:03.22 little it's not you know it's not that one that's for sure uh so mine is uh I

00:59:09.18 kind of went back to uh so mine is uh you know I said that I thought the uh the

00:59:15.20 the red pizza hut cup was was damn near perfect but you said

00:59:19.22 any cup we had had to be larger so I thought uh

00:59:23.06 the pizza hut cup is a great cup and you can see here the illustration there's

00:59:27.20 one holding in in someone's hand to give you a scale I took that cup and

00:59:31.17 I made it bigger and then I slapped uh and you can see on the side there uh it

00:59:36.02 says much bigger uh because it is it's much it's it's much bigger

00:59:40.08 did it not go into the no oh okay sorry there it is there we go

00:59:45.02 so you can see on the left that's a great cup that is your standard pizza

00:59:50.08 hut cup it's red it's plastic it's awesome

00:59:52.09 then uh on the right you can see best cup I mean I didn't put gurpler but

00:59:56.23 obviously it's the gurpler it's uh it's the same cup but much larger and I put a

01:00:02.15 face logo on it that's that way people know where it

01:00:07.16 came from yeah I I would buy this cup yeah this looks like a great cup

01:00:10.21 it's uh there's no wheels on it I was thinking you're right I was thinking

01:00:14.13 about putting honestly I was thinking about putting a

01:00:16.20 racing stripe down or something on it uh to add a little pizzazz but then I

01:00:20.09 decided not to I didn't want to over complicate it no but uh I'm glad I

01:00:23.17 didn't go that route because you took you took those ideas and you would you

01:00:27.14 put wheels on yours insane so uh these are two variations on a

01:00:31.12 theme I think they're both valid I think that they uh they both have their

01:00:36.06 pluses I think if the business world has shown us one thing

01:00:39.16 it's there's nothing better than taking somebody's else's id and just making it

01:00:43.17 slightly larger and then putting our brand like that's a great this is a stat

01:00:47.22 which this works well to be fair this one is much bigger

01:00:51.20 I don't know it is it's completely different

01:00:57.07 how big is much bigger uh I don't know you can see it's exactly that much

01:01:02.10 bigger uh I don't know the scale of the hand

01:01:06.04 was sat on a hat I was just curious if you had well I know but it's just it's

01:01:10.11 the it's a weird way to phrase it you're assuming it's the same hand those could

01:01:14.06 be two different hands it's the same hand I got it from the same image okay

01:01:18.05 it could be the left could be Andre the giant's hand and the right could be vern

01:01:21.22 troyer's hand it's not so it's for the for the purposes of the it's the same

01:01:25.12 hand it's the exact same okay it's an important clarification I even

01:01:29.00 copied and pasted it that it was so the same

01:01:35.11 uh yeah yeah yeah exactly Geoff Eric just posted two photos of like

01:01:44.21 visualizations of our ideas exactly right my inspiration was 100 the

01:01:49.22 Simpsons car he even mentioned that at the time I did

01:01:53.14 yeah he said he was getting a Simpsons car in this cup you definitely did you

01:01:59.03 definitely did oh man we closed some threads on that episode we closed not

01:02:18.23 the difficult available about it with our podcast is how they flow from

01:02:24.04 episode episodes so it's hard to tell a contained story

01:02:26.16 um and then he pointed out one episode where I oh time to feed the dog I would

01:02:31.12 have thought uh I would have thought it was 12 episodes worth of material and he

01:02:35.12 was like nope that was all in one episode hard to believe that we had the

01:02:40.17 entirety of cup theory uh the introduction of the face cooks the food to

01:02:47.07 wildly different cups the baseball signature and the completion of the bean

01:02:52.23 hole saga or this iteration of it and and the teasing of uh gavin's pizza

01:02:58.06 recipe all in one episode this one was no we act we completed it all on this

01:03:03.03 episode and it was a fantastic I genuinely have a headache from laughing

01:03:08.08 trying to source this is a nightmare we talked about the baseball thing and

01:03:13.12 probably like three minute chunks over 12 different episodes

01:03:18.05 how long ago did we start talking about that too I would love to know that what

01:03:22.07 is the first mention of the bat I remember it when you brought it up but I

01:03:26.04 don't know I feel like it was months ago if it was after episode 46 there's no

01:03:30.19 way to know right I'm going to cut together like full saga

01:03:34.01 videos for our YouTube channel from like the introduction the idea to the end of

01:03:38.04 each random thing we end up doing I think it'll be a fun little compilation

01:03:43.01 yeah I'll do that after I'm finished with the other two

01:03:47.07 yeah hopefully by the time this is out you'll be able to see

01:03:51.22 uh definitely the baseball video on YouTube on our face channel and

01:03:55.11 hopefully also the bean hole saga amazing well Gavin was so dejected we

01:04:00.07 were walking off the baseball field he was he was like I gotta cut I gotta go

01:04:03.23 through two hours of baseball punch I mean between the baseball and the bean

01:04:07.21 hall and all the baseball stuff I had two cameras going and my phone was in

01:04:12.23 slow-mo I've got about four and a half hours of footage

01:04:15.21 oh man that's so much dumbest stuff we need to do a face higher as an editor

01:04:20.21 I mean not that we don't have nick face higher is a supplemental video editor

01:04:26.04 that'd be amazing Eric get the credit card

01:04:28.18 you got it I'll hire an editor with the credit card

01:04:43.11 their weekend to hitting balls and eating beans

01:04:47.08 and uh you guys were wonderful and I'm happy that we there was stuff in the in
