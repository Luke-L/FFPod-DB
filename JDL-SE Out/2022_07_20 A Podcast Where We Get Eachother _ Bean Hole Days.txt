00:00:00.03 [Music]

00:00:07.23 [Music]

00:00:10.16 [Applause]

00:00:15.11 There's not enough weird athletes I agree Zack granky is it we have Zach

00:00:20.23 grenky and that's it Zack ranki's the weird guy and that's all we have and it

00:00:25.22 sucks we need more I don't who is Zach granky he's a pitcher he used to pit

00:00:30.01 well he's back on the royals now but uh I guess the most recent thing that he

00:00:34.23 did where he could like qualify him as like weird guy is uh

00:00:39.06 a fan was trying to get autographs handed him a baseball to sign it because

00:00:44.09 he was signing autographs he took the baseball turned around and threw it as

00:00:49.09 far as he could just away from them and the fan said why

00:00:53.14 did you do that and he said for my amusement [Laughter]

00:00:58.05 and it's weird because with social media you would think you would have more

00:01:02.02 access than ever to the weirdness of athletes but it's like this unfortunate

00:01:06.02 mix of like they got publicists at the same time like they worked out agents

00:01:10.20 and all that [ __ ]

00:01:12.19 yeah there's a team of four people in front of you and your mouth at all times

00:01:16.15 now yeah exactly yeah Zach Frankie is like my favorite professional athlete

00:01:20.08 just because of like the insane stories about Zach granky he's the [ __ ] best

00:01:24.17 I I love him but uh Gavin you can this is episode 112 so you can take it from

00:01:49.22 Into eric's open mouth whenever we can but yeah

00:01:53.22 you seem to be dispossessed of a level of energy this is a delivery problem no

00:01:58.05 yeah it was it was very like a serious like you're actually upset I often like

00:02:03.00 Geoff you gaslight Gavin all the time with asking if he's okay that might be

00:02:07.12 the first legitimate needed are you okay that we've ever had on the show

00:02:12.00 are you okay Gavin no I'm good I just I thought I was doing it right I need to

00:02:37.09 one before though yeah he missed he missed like one I really had nothing

00:02:41.05 yeah it was a really it was a strange call-out

00:02:44.07 I think I understood what you're going for it was just a mix there's a lot of

00:02:47.09 would you like to go again would you like to try it again I'll try next week

00:03:15.01 come see us in one week to hear how Gavin really gets me

00:03:22.19 hello and welcome to another episode of the F**kFuckFacePodcast a podcast where we get

00:03:28.20 each other uh and we tend to do it with a little more

00:03:32.04 energy than Gavin today my name is Geoff Ramsey with me as always Andrew panton

00:03:37.21 and uh the aforementioned Gavin free I believe this is episode 112 is that

00:03:44.04 correct that is correct episode 112 of uh season four year three volume one

00:03:49.18 chapter whatever how are you guys doing I'm excited it's been a while hasn't it

00:03:55.12 I know Andrew is excited yeah I need to talk to you guys about

00:04:00.16 something I'm very curious about well no I haven't done any well I did

00:04:05.03 something in the past as just the reaction to it and the lack of reaction here

00:04:10.12 I I made a complete ass of myself two weeks ago is it two weeks ago now and

00:04:16.04 there was zero I'm so curious if you guys noticed what

00:04:19.20 happened and you didn't address it or if you missed it as well

00:04:24.13 are you do you ever get what I'm talking

00:04:27.02 about you know do you understand I think you may be talking about a cove yeah

00:04:32.02 yeah [Applause]

00:04:34.11 so I didn't I had zero awareness that I [ __ ] that up

00:04:38.15 and it was an incredible the sentence let me just say the sentence as I said

00:04:43.16 it because it is it is a masterworks and stupidity

00:04:48.10 Jake is an endless treasure cove of words that are slightly wrong was the

00:04:54.02 sentence I said I know it's true I could I stepped in a shovel so hard while

00:04:59.16 laughing at somebody else you couldn't have scripted a better foot in mouth no

00:05:04.23 dude it's I wish I could like claim credit that's comedic genius if I

00:05:10.17 purposely did that I'm just an idiot and

00:05:13.07 I had no idea that happened and you guys didn't react to it at all so when the

00:05:17.22 episode came out I don't listen to the show but I look at the comments and

00:05:21.14 there were it was almost all talks about a treasure cove and I was like what is

00:05:25.18 what treasure cove like that it gives me very mini golf vibes when I hear

00:05:30.02 treasure cove I was like we didn't talk about mini golf dude I don't

00:05:34.08 I want a vacation in treasure cove I think it sounded it sounded wrong to

00:05:39.09 me but it didn't register that clearly I guess

00:05:42.06 just because it could be a Canadian thing or a north American thing and I

00:05:46.04 was just like well it seems like he knows what he's talking about like it it

00:05:50.00 it could technically be correct like a treasure like a cove of treasure

00:05:54.20 there's no there's no way to dig out of that it's it's wrong no it's totally

00:05:58.01 wrong I'm not saying it's right I'm the [ __ ] idiot I [ __ ] it up completely

00:06:01.14 but I'm saying as far as challenging it goes I could see there being a little

00:06:06.04 bit of resistance like for a half second but

00:06:09.05 so I was curious did you so Gavin and Geoff did you notice that not at all no I

00:06:13.06 think I think the thing that that and I recognize the audience feels like

00:06:17.11 we should have noticed and going back and listening to it it's pretty [ __ ]

00:06:22.10 like pretty clear sure uh but I think the thing that that gets missed uh is

00:06:26.07 that when we're doing the show like I'm kind of like I don't know about you guys

00:06:30.04 but I'm like giving you guys like 65 of my attention and then the other 35 I'm

00:06:34.16 planning like a bit or what I'm gonna say or how to work something in so it's

00:06:38.05 easy to miss stuff in the moment like that I try and listen with a higher

00:06:42.04 percentage than that I tried to be like like maybe at 90. But some stuff does

00:06:46.22 slip through that's too for sure that's far too high

00:06:50.17 was it always 65 Geoff or is this a sliding scale oh it's definitely a

00:06:55.18 sliding scale okay as the episode number goes up the percentage goes down

00:07:01.11 yeah year four Geoff or your three Geoff is a lot different than your one yeah

00:07:06.21 is it I'm guessing less it's continuously going down by sliding scale

00:07:12.01 it's not going back and forth it's just down it is sliding downwards with time I

00:07:16.23 mean I feel like I tell you guys all the time when I'm like I'm sorry I I tuned

00:07:20.18 out I wasn't yeah not that I feel like in the last steps I was listening to it

00:07:24.15 back and uh there was a period in the last episode where my headphones turned

00:07:28.17 off for like two straight minutes and Andrew you said something really funny

00:07:32.20 during that period where you said that you flipped your phone around to look at

00:07:37.14 the back of the card I thought that was really funny but I do feel like maybe

00:07:41.02 that fell in uh Geoff's 35 of not paying attention because there was literally no

00:07:44.21 reaction to that at all but I thought that was very funny I I'll be honest I

00:07:48.23 wasn't just listening to what you said Kevin what was I doing

00:07:52.08 you want to wait you want to do this another time

00:07:57.14 that was in response to you oh we'll do it again no

00:08:03.09 I'll tell you what I'll tell you what I tell you what no worries I'll go back

00:08:06.10 and listen to that part of the podcast when it comes out great but only that

00:08:10.17 only that part I was uh because there was some some

00:08:14.13 cosmic crisp crisp stuff we could talk about um later you were fun you were

00:08:19.20 annoyed when I talked to you the other day I was annoyed but before we did this

00:08:25.13 I wanted to check to see how we all rated the apple at that time I I didn't

00:08:30.05 get to try it in the actual review but uh so I wanted to listen to it I played

00:08:34.17 it back again an all-time not listening moment I forgot that this happened Geoff

00:08:38.20 you set up what we're gonna do you're like okay we've all had the apple or or

00:08:42.11 all you guys did and now we're gonna do it we're gonna do it on a scale of one

00:08:46.16 to ten ten being the best apple ever uh Gavin you go first what would you rate

00:08:50.19 the apple and Gavin immediately says what's the scale wasn't listening at all

00:08:56.10 it's a great there's a there's an established history of not listening and

00:09:00.17 missing the complete setup to what is what is currently happening

00:09:04.07 yeah it's always it's one of those things where you like you think because

00:09:07.05 you're a part of the process you think you know what's you know the spiel so

00:09:10.19 you're not really the spiel and it's like and what do you think of this goat

00:09:14.10 and it's like wait what and you just realized that you're not as tuned in as

00:09:17.19 you think this is perfect because it was literally 60 seconds of detailing the

00:09:22.07 specifics of the scale and then you immediately ask you well what's the

00:09:26.15 scale very genuinely but do we do we want to talk about the

00:09:29.22 cosmic crisp situation that has happened what's the situation

00:09:34.12 real real fast let's circle the wagons before we do that okay you have cause

00:09:38.14 we're gonna do two episodes I have a lot of notes but none of them are

00:09:42.11 particularly important although I feel like there are two things I should at

00:09:45.18 least mention but I don't even have to get to in this episode Gavin I remember

00:09:48.22 you said last episode you had like seven or eight things to talk about you only

00:09:52.14 got to one and then Andrew I assume you have a bunch too outside of cosmic crisp

00:09:56.22 I have a little bit yeah nothing I'd say essential

00:10:00.06 well let's just dive in with cosmic crisp okay

00:10:03.08 so uh we got I got a notification I was very excited we've tried in the past but

00:10:08.10 for the first time cosmic Chris has interacted with us on twitter in some

00:10:14.02 capacity there's somebody somebody is doing the test of having one

00:10:18.04 of their apples just out and seeing how it has lasted throughout these months

00:10:22.20 and so they did like a collage of this is like the start month two month four

00:10:27.16 months yeah I'll go ahead and pay attention now

00:10:30.13 yeah montage those wrong yeah okay that was wrong that was that was [ __ ] up by

00:10:35.00 me uh mont what is a collage well that'd

00:10:37.12 be if you if they took a picture a bunch of pictures and then sort of cut them

00:10:40.12 all out and stuck them to the same piece of cardboard wouldn't it yeah

00:10:44.17 and what was the other word montage montage as a montage a montage can be a

00:10:51.05 stationary image a collection of like four images well it's more of like a

00:10:55.16 progression of time isn't it yeah and like a bunch of different stories yeah I

00:10:58.18 guess I've just never thought of a photo montage before but you're totally right

00:11:03.07 that makes sense does that mean a time lapse is a photo montage could be anyway

00:11:09.01 sent these photos and they they asked them are you testing

00:11:13.15 our apples and then I got in there a little bit and I was so excited because

00:11:17.03 we've tried to interact with them in the past with zero response which is

00:11:20.15 understandable considering the name of the show um

00:11:23.16 and it was the first time they interacted so so we I commented back to

00:11:27.09 them they liked it I got all excited and then like three hours later I looked at

00:11:33.01 my phone and I got the notification that cosmic crisp is now following the

00:11:37.05 facepod twitter oh and they they only follow like 98 people at the time it was

00:11:42.21 very funny list so I looked.

00:11:47.03 I looked at who they were following and I was I was very excited because 98

00:11:52.02 people I'm like oh this would be a quick thing how many actual people yeah top

00:11:56.19 hundred it's a great way to put it they and it was

00:11:59.01 facepod and then the account they followed after that was Walmart and then

00:12:04.17 the account they followed after that was Geoff Ramsey they just followed Geoff

00:12:10.14 and I was disgusted in the car I was outraged that out of

00:12:15.08 all the people on this podcast the apple company follows the biggest banana guy

00:12:20.10 of the maybe in the world number one banana apple will never come

00:12:24.18 close to your banana fandom I will say I feel like I rated the cosmic crisp

00:12:28.15 higher than anybody else on this podcast that's you did which is well not me

00:12:32.05 because I didn't have it at that time but I'm disgusted with you Geoff because

00:12:36.00 I went back that's why I know the Gavin thing because I was going to put it in

00:12:40.02 part of my argument to be like this [ __ ] gave it a 4.6 and he got

00:12:44.12 the follow you gave it a 7.8 I believe and you ranked it above the average

00:12:49.02 apple yeah I don't remember what you said the average you said it was a great

00:12:52.17 apple so I couldn't I couldn't even use that against you but it was still I just

00:12:56.00 looked at it and shocked that they followed the banana guy they also follow

00:12:59.11 us on Instagram now they follow us on Instagram too

00:13:01.15 wow that's awesome where were they when we were an apple podcaster we're still

00:13:06.21 an apple podcast we're a time traveling basement equipment podcast [Laughter]

00:13:15.18 we are officially a a words.

00:13:22.16 [Laughter]

00:13:23.20 I realized I was having a flubby day until I messed up the beginning of the

00:13:28.15 podcast man I've been able to speak all day that

00:13:32.02 was you know what it wasn't a flub though the beginning of the podcast you

00:13:36.03 needed a vibe sommelier to get you to lead in on that

00:13:39.11 the vibe was off you know I don't I don't want to go off on a in a different

00:13:42.16 direction I don't want I don't want to leave where we are right now but this

00:13:46.04 brings up a point you being in a good mood in a talkative mood today Gavin I

00:13:49.22 saw Andrew let me tell you a little something I saw Gavin at rt two days ago

00:13:54.11 I wanna say okay or maybe it was even yesterday I don't remember uh I came in

00:13:58.20 to film one quick little thing and Gavin was there and I said hi to him and I

00:14:03.11 turned his [ __ ] left he didn't hang out he didn't check on me he didn't

00:14:06.23 like spend 30 seconds he just left I left off to work just ignored me and

00:14:10.18 left yeah I don't know I don't there's a lot of I feel like I'm lacking context

00:14:14.12 to be on your side so you said hi and he said hi not really he was he was

00:14:18.15 on camera and I looked over and I said hi to the guys and dipped in and just

00:14:21.13 said hello to the camera and then I walked over and I was hanging out with I

00:14:25.14 was I was hanging out with like other people from ah in the same

00:14:28.19 room and then I I realized I'm like oh I should probably get going at some point

00:14:32.15 I turn it gavin's nowhere to be seen all right let's go to the podcast I had to

00:14:36.15 be a podcast by five wait okay so you were not in a production you were

00:14:41.18 just hanging out you said hi while he was in he was filming something

00:14:45.12 I came to do a production but I couldn't start until his was over okay and which

00:14:49.11 wasn't a big deal I was just kind of hanging out and I was in no particular

00:14:53.04 hurry I didn't have anywhere to be uh I just wanted to spend time with my friend

00:14:56.09 Gavin just you know if you just a few pleasantries in person uh because I love

00:15:00.16 him so much and then uh he jacked me so what was the distance between you and

00:15:06.08 Gavin for this physical distance physical distance as

00:15:09.22 little as one foot when I went over to like pop up on camera

00:15:13.18 when we were when we were hanging out I would say like 18 feet I would yeah

00:15:18.02 that's a death in an open room how much time do you have to get to the

00:15:22.17 podcast Gavin when did you leave uh I probably had 20 minutes

00:15:26.04 oh god did you attempt did you at least look in the air did did you just not

00:15:30.00 think of it were you not because it's like it's like a 20-minute ride away so

00:15:34.04 I I'm hop I'm taking a piss and uh and then I went to try and get some food I

00:15:37.16 realized I didn't have time for that so I just hopped in a little lube

00:15:42.02 it's a 20 minute drive from where h records to the podcast it took me about

00:15:47.16 I think 18 minutes because it's like a really bad time to go anywhere

00:15:51.16 I would had I known I would have given him a ride over there

00:15:55.02 I don't you're about to be in something I thought you know I'm taking out

00:15:58.10 something I've got to be somewhere else you're about to be in something I'm see

00:15:59.22 you later I'll talk to you on no I don't know you didn't say see you later I

00:16:04.04 didn't even get that see you later one of them I missed

00:16:08.03 you see you later was what I was looking for man [Laughter]

00:16:12.19 I don't want to be late I just want me to be like I turned

00:16:17.07 around and I thought well Evan doesn't like me anymore

00:16:20.14 all right Gavin you're taking an interesting approach to this because if

00:16:24.02 I were you I would just say hey I wanted to do that

00:16:28.14 I had to rush like I felt bad about it you are the way you're phrasing this

00:16:32.19 it's like you made the decision not to it wasn't a thing of like it just didn't

00:16:36.13 cross your mind you actively said I don't want to be late don't got time to

00:16:41.11 say add to Geoff was was this on this Monday that this was

00:16:44.11 this previous podcast yeah this was the one where you were like the earliest

00:16:49.05 you've ever been [Laughter]

00:16:51.22 if you'll remember there was one recently where I was like

00:16:56.14 10 full minutes late oh right I'm not wait

00:17:00.03 right but we're talking about a second early I'm not I'm listen I'm on your

00:17:04.13 side I appreciate that you left without saying goodbye to your friend Geoff and

00:17:08.12 came and did the podcast thank you the amount of time that it takes for someone

00:17:13.14 to show up plus the amount of traffic I would say varies by 15 minutes

00:17:18.15 either way it's it's technically even your car

00:17:21.16 you could have just told me give me a ride to the podcast in my car I need to

00:17:27.20 hey I need to use the car what what does you being late have to do

00:17:33.05 with you now being so early is the I was trying to be like good pleasantry time

00:17:37.07 is for you to be to this show late is that how I'll get pleasantries out of

00:17:40.17 you am I late to this show no but I'm saying you wanted to show up early

00:17:44.10 because you were late to make up for the fact that you were late right

00:17:48.12 is that correct so I'm saying the only way for me to get you early is if you

00:17:52.09 show up late to the show that's the only

00:17:54.05 access to pleasantries but here the only thing I have to do is walk to my desk I

00:17:58.04 actually have to wait for someone to show up and go there that could be

00:18:01.16 that's quite a high variable well here's and it's life I don't want to make a

00:18:06.10 huge big deal out of it I just wanted to say

00:18:09.10 that um I'm gonna make a I'm gonna make a a promise

00:18:12.21 to all four of you right now that if I'm ever in the same physical

00:18:17.17 space with you and I know that you're there and I'm there I care enough about

00:18:21.11 you to come and say hello and goodbye I will always do that from this point on

00:18:25.02 for the rest of my life I don't want to make you feel de-prioritized in the way

00:18:29.00 that some other people may have felt in the past

00:18:31.16 I this was a twist because I really thought I would end up siding with Gavin

00:18:35.10 but I'm with you on this Geoff I feel like that was a disrespectful move by

00:18:39.12 Gavin intention I mean I just I'm like what am I what am I asking jack to do a

00:18:44.10 break show here or something I like that Eric sided with me and then

00:18:47.14 completely sold me out about how early right 100 yeah this again to reiterate

00:18:52.19 this is a podcast where we get each other so

00:19:11.18 the moment had I been yeah there's been no no harm

00:19:14.13 no foul it is one of those things where to me at the time I was like I didn't

00:19:17.19 even consider how it could be rude or how anyone would even miss me leaving it

00:19:25.07 and like checked on you and you were gone I'm like that [ __ ] really

00:20:31.20 have that one here oh you get way more credit for me I it didn't even cross my

00:20:35.16 mind I had the realization that you could do that literally yesterday so I

00:20:39.05 wrote up my notes assuming I appreciate the effort yeah I did it on the we were

00:20:42.17 walking around London we went to we did an escape room and we just happened to

00:20:46.02 walk by one I was like oh my god let me quickly check something but uh no no

00:20:54.13 oven in my backyard with your name on it we can create the world's best branston

00:20:58.17 pickle pizza and if you want I was thinking about this the other day my

00:21:02.12 neighbor is a chef who used to own a fancy pizza restaurant so if we need

00:21:05.12 help we could even pull him over though we don't have to yeah maybe we should

00:21:09.03 get the same we have a we have that a conduit for

00:21:12.03 excellent pizza if we need it or we could just [ __ ] fly blind go you know

00:21:15.21 do it ourselves style doesn't matter to me but I think we I'm excited about

00:21:19.13 making this Branson pickle pizza and I hope we do it soon I would honestly like

00:21:23.08 to see both and as as we've said the uh the baseballs and the bean hall videos

00:21:27.16 are both now out on our YouTube channel so we have uh we have the space to start

00:21:32.07 the next video they're great videos by the way that's the first time I watched

00:21:35.17 oh yeah you were excited for bean hall what did you think of bean hole bean

00:21:39.14 hole was awesome they were both really good videos no

00:21:44.06 background music a little long no I thought it was great [Laughter]

00:21:48.19 I the the build up of the being reveal and like trying to be kind of positive

00:21:54.13 about it Geoff you just staring for a long time going I wonder I wonder what

00:21:59.23 was wrong what went wrong it was great they're great videos

00:22:04.06 speaking of bean holes I do have one small thing you guys might have both

00:22:08.02 seen it because it came to me via social media

00:22:10.19 uh so I assume it probably made its way to y'all as well but are you do are have

00:22:15.16 you guys been made aware of the bean hole festival

00:22:18.01 no I I saw it was the thing but I don't know anything about it please I'll put

00:22:22.10 it in place we just missed it it was this was this week oh [ __ ] in Minnesota

00:22:28.00 there is a in pequot lakes there is a bean hole

00:22:31.01 days come and celebrate bean hole days in pequot lakes July 12th and 13th one

00:22:36.04 of a kind event is a root and tooting good for fun for the whole family dude

00:22:41.19 it gets so much better on the at 530 p.m they bury the beans

00:22:45.18 on Tuesday on Wednesday from 9 to 4 it's a craft fair with food vendors uh they

00:22:51.18 also have kids activities trampoline jump water wars and this is sort of just

00:22:56.11 like beans in the ground all beans yeah beans are cooking 1130 a.m this is the

00:23:01.16 big event to me they crown the king and queen bean

00:23:05.18 that's great I swear to god there's a yearly king and queen bean of pequot

00:23:11.09 lakes Minnesota and then at 12 noon they wake up in scarborough beans

00:23:16.13 I think they crowd I think you're like it's a man and a woman oh I hope the

00:23:20.12 crown is a bean I don't know if it is or not I don't see any pictures I was

00:23:23.14 imagining basically like four guys like a little crown on a little bean

00:23:28.15 and then and then because as you do at a bean festival from 12 to two they have

00:23:34.23 memories of Elvis tribute shows uh and then uh then they have a drive up and

00:23:40.19 pick up to go go to get beans and you can buy bean shirts and a bean mug so

00:23:45.14 here's what I'm saying 2023 it's the year of the bean hole festival

00:23:49.21 days we make it a big deal we have a fan

00:23:53.05 meet we have a community meet up at bean hole days in pequot lakes Minnesota I'm

00:23:57.18 assuming it'll exist in 2023. Let's fly the second they announce the dates let's

00:24:02.13 book our tickets the week we put out the bean hall video and then we missed that

00:24:07.22 by like a that was yesterday at the time the timing is insane damn I love the

00:24:11.23 fact that there is an elf is tribute show just in the middle of this what what

00:24:16.19 else could you need at a bean hole was he a big bean hole guy

00:24:21.03 I don't think so I think they're limited on whatever entertainment is available

00:24:24.19 in town and so it's like let's go go get Gary to dust off his guitar and do the

00:24:29.09 Elvis thing again there's nothing better than the serving of the beans to then

00:24:33.09 have the memories of Elvis in the background I mean beans I want to

00:24:38.12 reminisce about those great memories I wonder if he sings like

00:24:42.11 like a hunka hunk of being in love

00:24:45.12 you ain't nothing but a bean hole farting all the time dude he could do

00:24:50.17 all kinds of bean related parodies that would be awesome it'd be like he could

00:24:54.13 be like for all we know that dude is the weird iankovic of beans [Laughter]

00:24:59.11 I'd love if that person existed I hope that they are if there isn't if they

00:25:03.01 aren't the weird aloe beans we need to find the weird al beans because they

00:25:06.14 totally agree there's some more so anyway uh Eric if you could go ahead and

00:25:10.18 put that on the books uh 2023 bean hole days uh I'd like you got it I'll start

00:25:15.06 full cast together booking tickets or yeah

00:25:17.18 do you think there's hotels or do you think it's like a camping thing like a

00:25:22.04 Coachella or you have to like I'm down for you

00:25:25.12 I love the idea you're down to sleep in a tent at the bean festival yeah dude

00:25:31.14 it's [ __ ] winning Rome man all right these are simple being people

00:25:34.21 living a beanie life I want to immerse myself in their world

00:25:39.07 nick said be careful where you pitched the dead.

00:25:43.21 [Laughter]

00:25:51.19 [Music]

00:25:58.17 [Laughter]

00:26:03.22 I really want you to do round two of beads at the bead festival no training

00:26:08.22 no prep just giving it another go live in front of the people maybe we could

00:26:12.06 screen our bean hole video there and then have everyone tell us what we did

00:26:15.09 wrong yeah that's a great idea we can make a beat

00:26:19.05 we've already got a bean hole themed [Laughter]

00:30:40.17 I got uh I got a clip little video you have a clip I've just

00:30:45.22 got a thing to talk about that's never good this is scary because I asked him

00:30:50.17 specifically before we recorded if he had any audio pulled and he said no this

00:30:56.12 isn't this isn't for my show this is um oh it's too powerful

00:31:00.13 we going to slack going to slack it's like

00:31:03.03 I don't have slack set okay you don't have select uh not on this computer now

00:31:07.21 uh what shall I do for you that's fine just do slack and I'll make it work this

00:31:12.01 is a moment I had with my cat um so if you can play the video what's up

00:31:16.12 it has sound what it what's smee does sometimes is he'll just be howling

00:31:20.00 somewhere in the house and it's because he's got something in his mouth he used

00:31:24.15 to select he used to select beanie babies from a

00:31:27.11 meg's collection of beanie babies he'd like pick one each night and put it at

00:31:30.10 our door um he'll do it with socks and uh he

00:31:33.16 basically just like kills a sock and then wants to show me so he'll like howl

00:31:37.16 all through the house try and walk around the house until he

00:31:40.11 finds me and then dump it at my lap and uh I was just sat in my office and he

00:31:44.17 was like howling and then he he dumped it okay

00:31:51.09 what this is this is an audio podcast yeah uh

00:31:56.06 Gavin followed up a video of a cat walking with a sock in its mouth with a

00:32:01.03 picture of a sock on the ground and the sock has [ __ ] off embroidered on it

00:32:05.16 I didn't even know that was a pair of socks that meg had apparently.

00:32:10.13 I thought that was extremely rude and I just got back as well I was like

00:32:16.02 I've been back in england from england for like an hour

00:32:23.03 oh my god that's a literal that he legitimately just told you to [ __ ] off

00:32:28.13 and that and how it is in that picture on the floor is exactly how I looked at

00:32:34.00 it like it was the right way up and the facing

00:32:37.01 it's like you do my question is what would be more insulting the [ __ ] off

00:32:41.02 sock or if he walked out with the red one your curse sucks.

00:32:46.00 I would have been absolutely terrified I would have been to put him outside I

00:32:52.02 wouldn't have known what he was playing

00:32:54.23 oh Christ I don't think I've ever had my

00:32:58.00 animal communicate to me that way that's funny yeah does your cat not hun

00:33:03.07 not really my cat being as old as she is just mainly just like lays on a couch

00:33:08.18 and yells at people to sit next to her that's about that's about all I got as

00:33:13.12 far as my experience or she just sleeps not a lot of action going on definitely

00:33:18.19 no hunting I want to get uh maybe just 26 pairs of socks with different letters

00:33:24.19 on and see if he starts writing

00:33:28.10 just do like a really because it averages out to about one a day like one

00:33:33.05 kill a day and it basically like the slowest ouija

00:33:36.17 board of all time or what dude what you could do

00:33:39.21 you should definitely try that but then also just get a bunch of socks with

00:33:44.06 words on them like verbs and nouns and adjectives and then he could write you a

00:33:50.02 short story one word at a time what what words would

00:33:53.16 I have how many how many socks am I having to buy here

00:33:56.11 you probably buy a hundred pairs of socks okay with different stuff on them

00:34:00.07 so maybe the the hundred most frequently used words yeah but then the the short

00:34:04.16 story's gonna pay for it like we'll sell it you'll be able to make your money

00:34:08.04 back but it's really important you got to record the meows like when it's when

00:34:11.07 when he's howling uh that'll be the audiobook you need to put all those

00:34:14.15 together for the audiobook of your school.

00:34:17.16 I'm going to cover all markets Eric has oh no he unsent it the hundred

00:34:22.12 most common words in English that's exactly what we need I just figured that

00:34:26.15 would help you with your cat adventure or whatever you never know okay so I

00:34:30.08 need to it could be like you know 3128746 like you don't know

00:34:34.20 what it's going to be but um the cat is going to have a good time should I have

00:34:38.13 the ability to rearrange the words after

00:34:40.07 I've been brought enough or do I have to

00:34:43.01 take it in his order I think it's in his order yeah [Music]

00:34:47.16 let's see what kind of tape first let's let's see how how eloquent the cat is

00:34:52.17 we might have to do some I think one of the most commonly used words is word

00:34:58.13 should we sell as a product a sock of the month club where every month you get

00:35:04.15 a different one of the hundred most common words in america on your sock and

00:35:09.15 then it's over in 100 weeks.

00:35:12.02 I don't know why anyone would need that outside of this very specific case in

00:35:16.20 which Gavin is having his cat I don't know if if anyone would want a sock

00:35:20.12 you're not on it how many socks in the world are

00:35:23.18 there or socks how many cats in the world are there we could start a trend

00:35:27.23 now I just want I just want to make stuff with my socks now I'm maybe I'm an

00:35:31.14 audience of one but if there was a service I could buy to get the hundred

00:35:35.03 most common words uh one at a time on socks I would subscribe and it's one a

00:35:40.13 week yeah or one a month even whatever so two years of socks two years of socks

00:35:45.00 I love the idea of Geoff opening his box of socks getting his one pair of being

00:35:49.06 like I can you believe gong is in the top hundred I would have never guessed

00:35:53.14 this can you believe that like the excitement around yeah

00:35:58.06 why people talk about oil so much it's like a

00:36:01.09 a little present every month you get it oil didn't make the cut this year must

00:36:05.16 have been a bad year for oil I don't know what happened tough year dropped

00:36:09.22 off not enough oil talk this year I think if we made it face based like that

00:36:14.11 hundred most frequently used words of face

00:36:17.16 then it would be a much more interesting collection because you'd have uh Keenan

00:36:21.12 and kale written on some socks that has to be the most mentioned thing

00:36:26.06 I would say yeah I would think so tuxedo's gotta be getting up there tuxedo

00:36:31.18 oh I have a really important question about about the tuxedo and my get out of

00:36:37.13 Greg free card I just had this thought because we got it it's all secure well

00:36:41.22 we don't have we bought it we don't have it it hasn't

00:36:45.07 shipped yet there's part of me that is terrified that somehow it will get

00:36:49.16 [ __ ] up in shipping uh can I use my get out of Greg free

00:36:54.10 card on the tuxedo itself or is that exempt from the cart well how

00:36:58.19 have you gregg the tuxedo well I haven't yet but I'm saying if somehow I did

00:37:02.12 in the show if if something happens to the tuxedo in transit that won't be your

00:37:06.12 fault and you wouldn't need to use the card well I'm saying if like the wrong

00:37:10.17 address was somehow there if I filled out something wrong I didn't

00:37:14.20 but I'm just paranoid I'm paranoid that this is somehow going to blow up in my

00:37:18.04 face if you're not able to rectify it then yeah I think you would be able to

00:37:21.21 use the okay so the card applies to the tuxedo I gained it from successfully

00:37:27.16 doing the tuxedo but I could still potentially use it on a tuxedo Greg I

00:37:31.17 would hate for you to get it for successfully getting the tuxedo and then

00:37:36.19 lose it for [ __ ] it up in the hand off like it just seems like a real waste

00:37:40.23 yeah it had a Greg free card and I also have some plans

00:37:45.07 I have some plans for that [ __ ]

00:37:48.12 tuxedo hear me out uh have you guys ever looked at the tuxedo movie poster yes

00:37:53.14 I think we might want to consider I was thinking like now

00:37:58.04 we have this amazing tuxedo uh how what can we do with it right

00:38:03.01 I think what we could do is potentially recreate this movie poster

00:38:07.10 with Gavin in the tuxedo and vck on the boot of his shoe

00:38:11.09 I could be Jennifer love Hewitt in the pants suit and then Andrew could be like

00:38:16.21 represented in the in the like the wall water strider computer thing in the

00:38:21.20 background and then we could make uh our like but I could just say our tuxedo

00:38:28.12 now this I like this I believe it's a great idea and he's clearly up in the air

00:38:33.18 yeah during that picture so we could even make use of the harness holes oh

00:38:39.08 yeah yeah oh I should be on wire like wouldn't it be amazing to recreate

00:38:43.22 this [ __ ]

00:38:45.07 this exact movie poster also I don't know why we haven't talked about

00:38:50.14 this yet but entertaining and fun has got to be the lamest pull quote in the

00:38:56.12 history of film

00:38:58.19 if you're if you're just listening to this there's a the tuxedo movie poster

00:39:02.13 look it up it's got tuxedo in big letters it's got Jackie chan doing a

00:39:05.15 karate kick with his vck boots Jennifer love Hewitt is like bemused in the

00:39:10.15 background with her arms folded like oh Jackie he's at it again and then uh and

00:39:15.04 then right below his feet in huge bigger than the name Jackie chan bigger than

00:39:19.12 Jennifer love Hewitt a little bit smaller than tuxedo it just says in

00:39:23.15 quotes entertaining and fun

00:39:29.09 you know it's pulled from a quote that's like you would hope a movie starring

00:39:34.06 Jackie chan would at a minimum be entertaining and

00:39:37.02 fun comma but here we are and they're like got it entertaining and fun so we

00:39:41.09 needed I wish I still had my dvd I owned a lot

00:39:44.21 of shitty movies I'd love to go through and try to just find the worst one of

00:39:50.21 those because they all have them I'm always curious the process of like

00:39:54.16 how you get contacted for that like kangaroo jack probably has one of those

00:39:59.09 on the box did they like production reach out to that review what is the pro

00:40:03.18 do you get paid for having your quote on that box if so how much you do you do

00:40:07.20 not uh well I I can speak from Brewster teeth uh uh specifically uh

00:40:14.06 let me see if I can find it what all you gotta do is just take it

00:40:19.12 and put it on okay my favorite shitty back when I get DVDs all the time you

00:40:23.18 always look at the back for like special

00:40:26.06 features and you knew they were reaching when the top thing was interactive menu

00:40:31.12 great just like maybe the trailer and interactive menu top two you know

00:40:36.20 there's nothing it's useless surround sound

00:40:39.20 are you trying to find a box that you were quoted on in some capacity Geoff oh

00:40:45.11 I was looking for an old for the original

00:40:47.23 we used to have a quote I can't find it I just didn't want to misquote it wasn't

00:40:52.13 this someone for the bbc uh the one on the the one that's up there is bbc but

00:40:56.17 when we initially made it we uh I think it may be on the back somewhere um or

00:41:01.06 maybe we replaced it at some point but and I'm gonna butcher this story because

00:41:04.18 it's an old [ __ ] story but uh we got a review from the village voice and I

00:41:09.01 think the guy the guy who reviewed it said it was like clerks meets star wars

00:41:14.00 uh like but but as well as the quote we pulled and put on you know quote clerks

00:41:18.23 meet star wars because we thought that was hilarious but what he really said

00:41:21.14 was like every time you get a bunch of idiots that don't know what they're

00:41:24.23 doing together they try to make clerks meet star wars

00:41:27.20 so we were like perfect thank you and we put that up and then I guess uh years

00:41:32.17 later some that dude was a professor and some student who was an rt fan was like

00:41:37.00 hey you're on the cover of this dvd that uh that I love and he's like let me see

00:41:40.17 it and he was like those son of a [ __ ] they misquoted him so

00:41:45.05 while I was in england uh you remember a while ago we were talking about a bunch

00:41:50.00 of ideas that we didn't do for rtx but one of them was to have everyone write

00:41:53.13 or draw the ian on the wall and then I talked about how at my uh nursery school

00:41:58.05 they did a tea towel with everyone and everyone had their self portraits on I

00:42:03.07 went to my grandparents house and look what I found

00:42:07.22 oh my god where is it is it slack it should be a discord I don't see it

00:44:14.23 memories I must have been I must have been like two or three years ago so

00:44:20.15 if you're gonna mushroom three I love it so much if you wanted to describe this

00:44:25.19 to somebody just listening if they wanted to attempt to draw it how would

00:44:30.06 you describe the standard arms uh he's got standard ear arms and chin

00:44:34.21 legs and hairball I'd love if people want to try to draw

00:44:38.19 based off of that I would love to see what those look like.

00:44:43.18 I I just love the progression like you can see the ones on the bottom are the

00:44:47.21 people just about to leave nursery and the people on the top are the ones

00:44:51.22 who've just arrived god yeah poor Nicola yeah so 1991 yeah so I was I was three

00:45:58.04 who idea this is I would do worse no have no

00:46:01.22 here's what I mean I want to meet Geoff here's a question for you guys you

00:46:06.05 probably already met him here's a question for you do you think anybody on

00:46:09.18 this towel is dead oh they must be yeah probably right yeah I think uh

00:46:14.12 statistically a few of them have died do you think it was Thomas

00:46:19.11 I hope not I hope it's not heather heather had pretty eyes

00:46:23.12 I like the idea of any one of these committing a crime in real life and

00:46:28.14 having to try to give that description as the witness eight foot legs

00:46:33.12 lying right down the middle of their face I also love the idea of this being a

00:46:38.21 legal issue because we're using people's likeness.

00:46:50.00 I just want to look at these forever they're so good we have to do this we

00:46:54.19 have to do this at rtx next yeah we have

00:46:57.20 to yeah I think it'd just be such a nice and it was always the thing that they

00:47:01.05 said to the parents like I remember my parents had it in blue and my

00:47:04.12 grandparents had it in black and they they like displayed it proudly like it

00:47:07.11 was this throughout my entire childhood was

00:47:10.11 like dangled over the radiator by the dining room table so like I could always

00:47:14.17 see it that's so good it is I wish this is I wish this was a

00:47:18.15 tradition in america I wish I could say that I had one of these from

00:47:23.12 yeah it's quite 19 cute tradition 77 or whatever it would have been that's great

00:47:27.23 that's really cool man that I really I really do want to make

00:47:32.12 some version of this have you seen have you seen Ross Ross

00:47:36.13 where where where are we near you about below based on this he might be dead

00:47:41.22 he's he's below me he's on the line below towards the right

00:47:46.10 oh god he's all chopped up oh frost Ross what happened man

00:47:52.23 I wonder where he started because the legs are great

00:47:56.08 the legs were fantastic did a great job on those and then but unfortunately the

00:48:01.16 rest of them is in pieces going the other way yeah

00:48:05.18 look and to the right of Ross it looks like somebody honestly it looks like

00:48:09.02 somebody shot joanne right in the chest you could tell that the more advanced

00:48:13.11 students were able to write their own names as well I I clearly wasn't at that

00:48:17.15 level of being able to spell my name you're there now though I can do it now

00:48:22.00 yeah get it wow that's incredible I love these I'm gonna just honestly

00:48:27.01 when we're done when I have free time I'm just gonna look at this study Carly

00:48:30.22 Carly made like a melty happy face that's pretty cute oh Steven made oh

00:48:35.21 Stephen made like a looks like a little kitty cat kinda

00:48:39.03 all right we should move on for this entirely yeah yeah

00:48:42.19 nick feel free to cut all that out or some of it up

00:48:52.13 okay that's okay I mean yeah people do you want me to cut the school name out

00:48:56.01 or does it matter I didn't think it was okay all right well then yeah people

00:49:00.09 could look at this on our Instagram it might be more interesting to for anyone

00:49:03.23 who listens that just happened to go to the same nursery school as me and had no

00:49:07.17 idea oh that's wild that'd be cool I'll post if you're on the tea town not

00:49:11.14 dead let us know yeah we'd love to hear about your memories of making the tea

00:49:15.11 towel and if and if you knew Gavin during his quiet period

00:49:19.16 yeah or just if you're Harriet really want to meet Harriet

00:49:25.12 um that kind of leads me to what I was gonna ask Geoff I feel like 40 minutes

00:49:30.17 ago when I said I had a question for both of you

00:49:34.11 rtx happened yeah uh how are the grown tubes what happened with that well let

00:49:39.11 me tell you something let me tell you something right now

00:49:43.02 uh the grown tubes were in my estimation the biggest success in the history of

00:49:48.05 rtx wow if you're a regulation listener or comment leaver who came to us from

00:49:52.17 iTunes or however you found us on Spotify and you're not intimately

00:49:56.12 familiar with rooster teeth as an organization we do a yearly convention

00:50:02.04 uh in July here in Austin Texas and uh at the convention center uh I think like

00:50:07.11 comic-con but uh way smaller and uh but awesome

00:50:09.15 and uh this year we we released the grown tubes there and they sold out

00:50:14.11 pretty instantly and I saw them constantly and I did the uh I will say I

00:50:19.09 did the off topic which is another podcast roosty does it was like the

00:50:24.02 the podcast to end rtx and so when I got there I I was like let's hear the

00:50:28.10 [ __ ] grown tubes and we had everybody doing them so much that it made Michael

00:50:31.23 so [ __ ] mad michael's the guy who runs that podcast

00:50:35.05 that he went over and told the guardians

00:50:37.18 to kick anybody out who groaned tube for the rest of the [ __ ] podcast and I

00:50:41.11 think he was sad I think he was like really angry which I told the audience

00:50:45.13 you've done your job thank you like I was like it's not every day that I get

00:50:50.08 an up I get the opportunity to actually annoy him and so uh it was a huge

00:50:54.18 [ __ ] victory uh and a bit of a bit of a bucket list if I'm being honest with

00:50:57.23 you so what did they all sound like all together I mean was it just like a

00:51:01.12 constant groan or was it like a bunch of people were they all timed right or was

00:51:05.02 it just no no it's a big mess it just it sounded like it would come in waves

00:51:08.16 where it would like start quiet and then

00:51:10.12 get loud and then get quiet and get loud because people were like turning them

00:51:15.03 over none of them were like consistent or at the same time so it was like a

00:51:21.01 cacophony of just wow it was crazy you know what's interesting too

00:51:25.15 I I told you guys last time I did that event in Atlanta and I signed a ton of

00:51:29.16 baseballs I don't think I assigned maybe

00:51:31.18 like two or three at rtx it was weird it was like not a baseball town I guess um

00:51:35.15 so I don't know if this means we're not a baseball equipment podcast anymore but

00:51:39.12 I definitely signed a lot of zimmers they were they were out in droves that's

00:51:43.12 great have you gotten one of the grown tubes Gavin yeah I got one

00:51:47.07 it's amazing how much the plastic silences them I didn't real like I kept

00:51:51.17 mine within the plastic case it came in as this

00:51:55.22 was what do you mean it's a it's plastic no but but you know like a cape

00:52:02.19 it came in a in a plastic like wrap it was wrapped in plastic and I just had

00:52:07.22 been using it in that I still have it in

00:52:10.12 it and I took it out I could not believe how much it silenced it those are

00:52:12.12 [ __ ] loud I guess it's kind of disappointing at first that they're kind

00:52:16.00 of quiet but they're they're loud I will say compared to the grown

00:52:19.06 tubes I had as a kid they have much shorter travel time yeah yeah these are

00:52:24.12 like what like less than a second I had I swear I had one that was like

00:52:29.16 like a real long one it wasn't it wasn't physically longer it just moved slower

00:52:34.13 like it was packed in tighter or something yeah now are you sure this is

00:52:39.01 true or is this like a rose-tinted glasses thing looking back

00:52:43.03 it could be you remember exactly when I had legs coming out my chin and a

00:52:47.22 ball on my head it sounded a lot longer [Laughter]

00:52:52.06 I'm glad that they were a success and that they were annoying in a great way

00:52:57.05 and and by the way I spoke to so so so so many regulation listeners and so many

00:53:03.07 comment leavers and it was a genuine joy to meet you all uh thanks for coming up

00:53:08.10 and saying hi and uh taking a photo or like making fun of Gavin or whatever you

00:53:13.12 did for me I really appreciate it and uh

00:53:15.06 thanks for coming out and supporting rtx it was really cool there were so so so

00:53:18.16 many uh face uh official there were so many [ __ ] out there it was awesome

00:53:23.21 it made me so happy to see all the photos from the meet up

00:53:26.18 the first oh yeah the meet up was meet up was awesome I went to the meet up

00:53:31.01 uh I know here's what I'll tell you one thing

00:53:34.00 I got [ __ ] tongue tied there for a second uh I went to the meet up I wasn't

00:53:38.20 supposed to or anything I just heard and I wanted to show up and say hi and say

00:53:41.03 thank you to everybody and jack told me about he goes hey did you hear there's a

00:53:44.17 meet-up and I was like yeah of course he's like I'm gonna go check it out and

00:53:47.18 I was like cool we can go together and then then the meet up came and jack was

00:53:51.09 nowhere to be found ran into him like an

00:53:54.00 hour later and Emily was like hey I miss you at the meet up buddy and he was like

00:53:57.05 oh yeah forgot about that and then around here

00:53:59.16 somewhere oh and he just kept going so like he prioritizes the brake show I

00:54:04.21 think jack's just on another level he's screwing with us on a

00:54:09.07 on in a level that's he what

00:54:12.23 he's he yeah he's he's functioning on some level

00:54:16.19 above us and he's [ __ ] obviously got a much lower level apparently yeah is it

00:54:22.21 are you is it is the cat in the room with you are you feeling nervous

00:54:28.00 the stock's still here though also rtx related you did a panel with bobby lee

00:54:36.02 oh yeah which I didn't know the face or something different no it was just he

00:54:42.12 was just there I I know it I would never

00:54:45.09 cross bobby lee with rtx in my head like I was surprised to see him there but I

00:54:49.10 was excited about it I was when you I think you tweeted you you're gonna do a

00:54:53.12 panel with them and I was like holy [ __ ]

00:54:55.22 bobby lee is there it's a great draw how did that go what

00:54:59.18 was that experience like uh I'll be honest with you it was uh it was

00:55:03.20 like a highlight of my career um he I did not really know what to expect

00:55:08.15 and it was uh one of those things where I kind of came together at the last

00:55:11.17 minute and they were like hey will you do you want to do a panel with bobby and

00:55:14.06 I was like yeah absolutely what do you guys what do you want to do and they're

00:55:17.09 like you figure it out so I wasn't quite sure how to do that uh

00:55:22.12 but I like a challenge and I'm I'm bad

00:55:25.05 at saying no to stuff so I was like [ __ ]

00:55:28.06 yeah I'll figure it out and then so he flew in and uh I met him for lunch

00:55:33.18 so that we could build up some form of rapport before we perform together for

00:55:39.08 the first time uh so like maybe two hours before the event we went

00:55:44.23 and had lunch downtown and uh I don't know what to say other than um

00:55:49.13 he might be the most spiritually uh aligned with face out of any other

00:55:55.03 person I've ever met my entire life like

00:55:59.02 it was weird he uh we we sat down and we

00:56:01.09 had the lunch we started to kind of riff off of each other and get to know each

00:56:05.09 other then we got into an argument about

00:56:07.05 how the lunch was going and then we both agreed to rate the lunch so that we

00:56:10.12 could see where we both sat on the spectrum but then we couldn't figure out

00:56:14.17 a rating system and then we argued over the rating system of one to ten for a

00:56:18.18 while and then we finally agreed and then we rated the lunch differently and

00:56:23.05 then that made us fight and then we did a panel together and it was one of the

00:56:27.12 funniest panels I've ever done and then he was we were pretty much attached at

00:56:31.12 the hip for the next two days I just like kind of had had meals with him and

00:56:35.04 hung out with him and uh he's just a really funny lovely dude and I probably

00:56:39.22 sh this is probably too early to say stuff like this but uh he uh [ __ ] I

00:56:44.04 don't care uh I'm unprofessional as [ __ ]

00:56:46.03 uh I got him to agree to do a podcast so uh with me so we're gonna do like uh I

00:56:50.05 don't know if it'll be I mean obviously face is sacrosanct we don't touch it but

00:56:54.17 uh at least like a couple times a year I'll do some sort of

00:56:58.09 shoulder content podcast with bobby lee that I don't know if it'll live in the

00:57:01.12 face universe if you guys want it it can or it can be just in the larger roost

00:57:05.07 teeth but yeah he's he's a he's a lunatic in all the right ways I was

00:57:09.14 worried that you weren't doing enough podcasts so that's a really

00:57:14.04 how do I say no to doing a podcast with bodybuilding though no that's fair uh

00:57:19.22 I'm curious so when you reviewed the lunch how did you deliver because in my

00:57:25.01 head that'd be a problem of the person who says it first is then sort of

00:57:28.19 guiding the response review was it a situation which you both said

00:57:32.12 at the same time or did you like write it

00:57:34.23 we both kind of said it at this we both kind of said at the same time at the

00:57:38.06 same time I said eight he said eight and a half and uh that would they would

00:57:42.10 there was a vast difference between eight and eight and a half in our minds

00:57:46.09 and he was in point five highly insulted by what I thought eight was so

00:57:51.00 sounds like he's he's uh heavy on regulation he's a pretty heavy on

00:57:54.20 regulation yeah yeah I would say that he's a he's a regulation dude for sure

00:57:59.05 get on with Andrew pretty well by the sense of it uh

00:58:02.20 you know it was it was funny because I was thinking to myself uh

00:58:07.02 as I was kind of like you know just spending the weekend with them

00:58:10.06 explaining rooster teeth to them and showing them around and all that stuff I

00:58:14.04 realized I'm kind of uniquely prepared for this because I've been working with

00:58:18.02 Andrew for a very long time and I feel like I feel like it's just like
