00:00:23.06 [Music]

00:00:30.05 [Music]

00:00:32.22 [Applause]

00:00:37.09 Uh we've been going for yeah like a second we're just starting

00:00:42.06 but I loaded into a ranked match just when everybody was like we're gonna go

00:00:46.06 so I'm in the sand right now in a halo infinite rank game not expecting us to

00:00:51.14 be to be recording uh so I'm doing two things at once at the moment

00:00:55.22 Geoff what episode is this hello and welcome to another episode

00:01:00.04 of the F**kFuckFacePodcast my name is Geoff Ramsey with me as always Gavin free and

00:01:05.12 it sounds like we have one half of Andrew payton's attention

00:01:09.10 more than I'd say it must be an important soccer match going on if

00:01:13.18 you're not paying attention I believe this is episode three I think this is

00:01:18.17 the second ep or third episode of year two season

00:01:22.10 three you've confused me with that that's just exciting you said you said

00:01:26.08 81 should be the first episode of series three season three but then you made

00:01:31.11 last episode well see no you you're the reason for that I said 81

00:01:35.12 should be and then you said we don't have to follow a specific path

00:01:39.15 they don't have to be the same number apart and I said okay they won't be

00:01:42.18 we'll start next episode so there's one episode of difference so each season

00:01:48.02 will be incrementally longer than the or shorter who [ __ ] no

00:01:52.03 all I know is that this is officially well into season three year two and uh

00:01:57.07 year three is right around the [ __ ]

00:01:59.00 corner I don't know about you guys but I'm very excited to be in year three

00:02:02.11 season three uh that's when I feel like that's when we hit our stride what if

00:02:06.17 this is the season finale of season three I like it cause we're gonna see two

00:02:11.22 episodes long I didn't really want to be in season three but I'd be I like I'd

00:02:16.04 love to meet in season four I support that season three of a show is always a

00:02:20.01 really good season though what do you mean now

00:02:22.18 I disagree I'll go I'll go to exactly I'll go further

00:02:26.19 uh season three of always sunny was phenomenal I uh it was absolutely the

00:02:30.22 best season at that point and the best season probably till season five and

00:02:34.15 then seasons three of friends I think was good uh like

00:02:38.17 shut up joey and chandler had their stuff stolen that was funny did they oh

00:02:43.02 was that season four that might be season four is that the one where joey

00:02:47.12 chandler had their stuff stolen is the episode title

00:02:51.11 what is the or is it a plot I don't remember the I feel like the uh

00:02:54.21 lost season three I feel like sucks I feel like last season three isn't very

00:02:58.12 well I feel like lost sucks uh how about like when you look at that

00:03:03.01 show in its totality you're like no I wasted my time absolutely not I couldn't

00:03:07.11 disagree more this is really this is as bad as your

00:03:10.03 home loan opinions which we don't need to get into now first off you're gonna

00:03:14.21 piss off Eric first off going for I want let me finish I I was

00:03:18.12 going to say it's not just tv shows and things with seasons that are the third

00:03:22.12 of the best I think the third song on an album is almost always the best song on

00:03:27.18 the album you guys ever noticed that no it was the first

00:03:31.12 if I listen to a new album I listen to the third song first every time because

00:03:34.19 I know that's where the because the first song

00:03:36.17 is always going to be a [ __ ] around intro bit then the second song's like

00:03:40.02 and the third song is when like you get you like [ __ ] that's when they kick

00:03:44.10 it in and that's when it gets the third song on thriller um [Music]

00:03:48.23 but it's by the best song yeah there you go

00:03:51.09 oh is that the right and that's just a list of singles track listing the girl

00:03:55.14 is mine

00:03:58.17 that is a great song what are you talking about the girl is mine's a funny

00:04:02.12 name it's not the song of the album though

00:04:04.22 your whole point was the best song of the album is always the third song

00:04:08.04 that's not the best song of that album I don't say always well I guess I did say

00:04:12.10 always but I find it to be the case more often than not there's probably

00:04:15.19 exceptions to every rule uh but I find it to be more often than not the third

00:04:20.17 song is the best song the um oh god cat just jumped

00:04:24.09 how many songs did he do with Paul McCartney Michael Jackson yeah he did

00:04:29.09 say say right and and the girl is my friend the girl is mine I had the sport

00:04:35.05 that might be it that I can think of I don't so this is what I know is that

00:04:43.14 Michael didn't Michael Jackson own the Beatles catalog

00:04:47.11 wasn't that a whole thing yeah it's it's funnier than that

00:04:52.04 like I kind of it's a thing that I vaguely know about and the way it's

00:04:56.06 described is almost like Paul McCartney got drunk and lost it in a poker game

00:05:00.04 like I don't understand no no I can I can I can tell you I can tell you the

00:05:05.03 story as I remember it I'd love to hear it

00:05:07.03 Paul McCartney and Michael Jackson were friends they played those songs together

00:05:10.06 they were Michael Jackson was getting advice they were just talking about

00:05:13.05 careers and stuff and Paul McCartney said uh gave Michael Jackson the best

00:05:17.16 [ __ ] advice you can probably give a musician that's

00:05:20.12 what Taylor swift's going through right now uh he said you should own all your

00:05:24.05 own music so you should if you can you should buy back the rights to all your

00:05:27.14 music you should buy you should own the rights to music and Michael Jackson went

00:05:31.04 oh that's really smart and then he went and said why why would I just buy my

00:05:34.18 music the Beatles are really good I'll buy their stuff too

00:05:37.22 and he had the money to do it he said I just own the rights to your [ __ ] too

00:05:41.05 while I'm at it why not it's great advice that is fantastic and he didn't it

00:05:45.06 wasn't a move to be like hey I got this for you merry Christmas could you

00:05:48.12 imagine coming I was like thanks for your advice

00:05:50.18 that was really smart I'm gonna make I'm gonna build wonderland never land ranch

00:05:54.12 now off the proceeds of apple records or whatever I I couldn't imagine a cooler

00:05:59.11 Christmas gift than coming downstairs and then seeing the entire Beatles

00:06:03.11 catalog is now yours you just know this open up the gifts just all of the

00:06:07.16 Beatles rights what a time what a weird thing why didn't Paul McCartney

00:06:12.15 do that ahead of time why did he not why how did he have the foresight I don't

00:06:18.08 think he realized that Michael Jackson was going to turn around and buy all his

00:06:23.16 [ __ ] no but if he all the [ __ ] if he knew that was a great idea

00:06:28.11 how did he like how did he know enough that you should do that yet didn't what

00:06:31.23 does he own who's did he just have his like is this just uh I give great advice

00:06:37.12 but don't follow it no I'm sure he probably owns like the

00:06:41.20 full catalog to wings which was a huge band uh

00:06:45.00 and uh probably all of his solo stuff and who knows maybe he owns maybe he

00:06:48.20 owns the rights to some of the Beatles stuff he wrote I have no idea I'm not

00:06:52.10 close Paul and I aren't close I'm just retelling the story that I remember as I

00:06:56.10 remember from when I was a kid I feel like there could be worse people that

00:07:00.10 own the entire Beatles catalog than aren't that aren't that aren't Jackson

00:07:05.00 like I feel like weirdly and people like unfairly take digs at Ringo it just it

00:07:10.08 would be hilarious to me if Ringo ended up with it all [Laughter]

00:07:13.22 I like Ringo starr so much he has so many albums he has too many

00:07:17.23 too many albums and I say that with one of us should buy one of us should buy

00:07:22.00 face yeah what's it what uh I don't know but you're the one

00:07:26.06 it sounds like you're volunteering let's get a price Eric what's it worth yeah I

00:07:29.19 was gonna say I feel like this is just a scam where Eric will tell us an amount

00:07:33.00 and we'll give it to him and he'll just like write on a piece of paper that you

00:07:36.08 own it this is a great idea this is how nfts work I think so we'll say

00:07:41.01 we'll say sixty thousand 60000

00:07:45.07 yeah so if you want to make that check out to me that's fine I'll put five I'll

00:07:51.16 put 500 bucks in wow Gavin you come up with the rest

00:07:55.06 could I just buy episodes or do I have to buy the entire catalog yeah you can

00:07:58.15 buy individual episodes however they they are more expensive that way options

00:08:05.01 you get a volume deal I have no idea if 60000 is an absolute bargain or a

00:08:10.06 complete rip-off I have what I literally have no idea which way that would go

00:08:16.02 can we buy somebody can we buy something can we and I mean we're trying to buy a

00:08:21.21 [ __ ] superhero and it's not working that's I feel like we're more likely to

00:08:27.00 buy some like kind of who is like an artist that is known but not known like

00:08:31.16 not like it wouldn't be I don't know trying to think you would think we'd be

00:08:35.11 more likely to buy the [ __ ] that we already own

00:08:38.21 this is our podcast yeah but I mean it does didn't work out well for Paul

00:08:43.05 McCartney well we should I think I'm gonna go I'm gonna well he's dead

00:08:48.13 his dicks but I'm gonna I'm gonna assume Paul McCartney is doing just fine oh

00:08:52.20 totally fine financially and otherwise if we pull a Jackson maybe we could just

00:08:56.15 buy like black box down or something that's gonna say yeah oh that's that's

00:09:00.15 what we want to do like we'll go yeah let's go buy face jam

00:09:04.16 that'd be [ __ ] awesome what is we'll buy one of them that's fine

00:09:08.21 that's 60000 also you can just make write me a check for 60000.

00:09:12.18 Do you know what I wish we could do go ahead Eric was just saying that he

00:09:16.08 probably owns the wing stuff and I was just going to say that's

00:09:18.23 just going to say I don't I don't think wings gets enough credit it was a

00:09:22.17 fantastic band fantastic music but they were they uh live and let die was that

00:09:25.22 technically wings I believe so yeah and banned on the run

00:09:29.07 and yeah there were so many what were they running from

00:09:33.22 Michael Jackson.

00:09:38.21 I love the idea that Paul McCartney regrets that and he's like he's like 78

00:09:43.11 years old and sitting at his [ __ ]

00:09:46.06 kitchen table balancing his checkbook going god damn it Jackson [Music]

00:09:50.22 here I am broke trying to pay the bills I'd only listen to my own advice to what

00:09:55.12 and could could we just like throw it on eBay as like an auction like could that

00:09:59.11 is that like a path what are the rules to

00:10:01.22 I feel like there must be rules to this you can't just buy it's not just like an

00:10:06.02 open market well it has to be for sale I think step

00:10:08.21 one you gotta find something that's for sale

00:10:11.20 yeah I think I think I think that's where you're gonna get hung up we you're

00:10:15.12 right you can't just buy anything it has to well it means to be available if the

00:10:19.11 price is right I'm sure you could buy it anything unless that's true machine

00:10:26.08 negotiations yeah I was trying to buy a pinball machine recently and the guy

00:10:30.12 basically was like you know what I'm not gonna sell it my kid wants it and I

00:10:34.20 assumed he was he just wanted more money because he was like you know maybe if

00:10:38.06 the price is right I'll give my kid the difference and that will justify him

00:10:41.21 losing his pinball machine so I was like oh this freaking guy trying to

00:10:46.12 trying to con me out of money so I offered him more and he was like no

00:10:51.20 seriously my son really wants to keep it the negotiation just died

00:10:56.10 so why is it on the market doesn't sound like it is yeah so some I guess I

00:11:01.17 I should have just kept offering like not that I would pay it but I should

00:11:04.21 have just seen what the guy's price truly was yeah at what point will he

00:11:09.00 betray the request of this kid I'd love to know what that number is do

00:11:12.16 you ever wish that you could just try stuff out that's illegal but

00:11:17.20 what I mean like well I basically I wish

00:11:21.19 you could try stuff but but up front say that it's just a joke so like don't

00:11:26.19 apply the law to it no.

00:11:30.17 I was watching uh I was just like falling asleep to crap on YouTube and at

00:11:36.03 some point I guess it steered into the realm of like

00:11:40.10 customs agents like documentaries about airports and stuff and they were like

00:11:46.10 x-raying bags to see like oh there's uh 8000 cigarettes so this this one

00:11:50.05 oh there's a little bag of coke in this one and it's always like it always

00:11:53.21 starts with the x-rate where they're looking for like containers that stand

00:11:59.07 out from the rest of stuff but then I just thought

00:12:02.13 what if you just filled an entire suitcase with just loose cocaine like

00:12:07.09 full to the brim of only cocaine what would that show up like on the x-ray I

00:12:12.06 thought it'd be really funny to try to see if I could get like an only cocaine

00:12:16.03 suitcase through customs because it would just look like nothing Kevin

00:12:21.05 you're also I don't you're just describing a hidden camera

00:12:25.07 prank show is all you're doing this is all you've done

00:12:28.19 you usually do like classic just invented punk

00:12:31.21 it doesn't need to be actual cocaine you can get something that looks like you

00:12:36.04 can do the exact same there yeah exactly Ashton kutcher is just waiting in the

00:12:40.15 you just didn't your idea is pumped yeah congratulations

00:12:45.16 also like what a weird [ __ ]

00:12:48.10 do you ever wish that like you get a j get out of jail free card is how you set

00:12:53.06 it up and then your get out of jail free card is just being caught with a giant

00:12:57.15 bag of code like it's not the yeah the problem with the get out of jail free

00:13:01.14 card is you would use it immediately on something dumb yeah I wouldn't actually

00:13:05.19 want to

00:13:14.15 let's say you get applied a get out of jail free card right except it

00:13:19.12 immediately is used the moment you break any law of any kind how much more

00:13:23.15 complicated your life would be jaywalking technically a fine like you

00:13:28.02 got to always use the line your life would become so much more convenient by

00:13:31.18 like the small weird laws what would you be saving it for though or

00:13:36.04 just kill somebody immediately just immediately murder somebody like what do

00:13:41.05 you do you still have to live with the memory and the guilt

00:13:44.20 of murdering someone no no no no no I would never okay I wouldn't no I would

00:13:48.10 immediately try to rob a bank robin hood did it he seemed good we

00:13:52.00 didn't rob a bank you know there would be you know there'd be some sort of a

00:13:55.04 [ __ ] loophole where you try to rob the bank and the cops come up and you're

00:13:58.13 like no no no no I have this get out of free Jill get a jail free card get out

00:14:03.02 of free jail card and uh and the complicity goes this is only there's

00:14:07.07 only valid in the continental united states yeah this uh yeah this had to be

00:14:12.13 presented before you committed the crime yeah walked on the way [ __ ]

00:14:20.00 you are going to get out of jail free for breaking the glass to get into the

00:14:25.01 bank offense after that is quickly saying put the money in the bag [ __ ] was

00:14:30.20 assault and that was your first crime [Laughter]

00:14:35.18 yeah the crime would have to be victimless and it would happen oh yeah

00:14:40.15 and I think you'd have to really read up on all of the laws because I assume

00:14:45.16 people break the like road laws all the time oh constantly without even

00:14:50.15 realizing maybe I wonder if there's like once you read

00:14:55.04 can I is there just a book of laws can I just like where do I find the book of

00:14:59.11 laws what's the law isn't it it's like I know it okay is there a document can I

00:15:04.13 can I like airbud rule it and be like there's no law saying I can't like when

00:15:10.02 you're defending someone in court they're not saying like they're not

00:15:13.22 quoting laws from nowhere it's written like the law is in place

00:15:18.18 physically somewhere where do I download the law I wonder how

00:15:24.04 big how big is the pdf of the law Canadian book of laws I'm assuming is

00:15:30.17 what it would be called yeah the Canadian book of laws now now we know

00:15:35.10 what to get you for Christmas oh I cannot wait to read because we can find

00:15:39.22 I recently and very comparable I just recently read through the entire nfl

00:15:43.10 rule book and there's some there's some fun stuff in there there's some room to

00:15:47.22 do whatever you want to do there's a thing speaking of it this is actually a

00:15:54.06 perfect segue [ __ ] Gavin won seven coin tosses in a row last episode we

00:15:58.17 recorded or released yep there is a rule that was fun to listen to by the way

00:16:03.20 just that in the nfl there's a rule where for the coin toss so every game

00:16:09.05 opens with a coin toss and the away team has to make the call and then they

00:16:13.20 essentially decide if you win if you want the ball in the first half or the

00:16:17.10 second half is your decision and there's I think an advantage to having in the

00:16:20.23 second half so there's it's you want to win the coin toss technically speaking

00:16:25.23 the people that are allowed to take the coin toss are I think captains of the

00:16:30.10 team either on the roster off the roster or

00:16:33.16 an honorary captain which typically is used for like members of the armed

00:16:39.08 forces or like just like heroes of some kind but technically speaking

00:16:44.04 you could hire a coin toss specialist as a team and have somebody who's just

00:16:48.19 really good at coin tosses I would love to take an nfl coin toss how could he be

00:16:53.13 good at coin tosses I I think you could what you say that you won seven in a row

00:16:58.12 last week you were solved not only did I not flip any of

00:17:02.21 the coins or I didn't even call the coins you took the one I was gonna have

00:17:08.10 and I was left with the drags yeah but you you won seven in a row that coin

00:17:12.04 tilted towards your favor I think you're

00:17:15.18 you are an above average coin tosser and there's sadly no official tournaments

00:17:20.12 I actually think it's the opposite uh I think you're exceptionally bad I think

00:17:25.12 it was I don't think it was that Gavin being good because he's he's had coin

00:17:29.22 toss problems in the past okay.

00:17:36.08 I think it had more to do with you and less to do with him I do think you're on

00:17:40.15 to something though like I don't know why if you're a team

00:17:45.01 uh I don't know los Angeles rams uh uh eric's favorite team uh what if you

00:17:49.22 what have you hired like the amazing crescent or Frederick de silva or some

00:17:55.09 like famous mentalist like shin lin or like some or like one or like uh one of

00:17:59.02 those like people that the cops hire in to come in and who's like psychic and

00:18:02.20 tell you how to like touch a piece of fabric and tell you how somebody was

00:18:06.19 died like I would have that person on retainer for every coin flip

00:18:11.07 I don't like initially when I read it I thought oh they have to be a part of the

00:18:15.08 staff so like or maybe an active player which you have a cap on so like I would

00:18:19.12 understand maybe not worth having a coin toss specialist but it

00:18:23.15 doesn't have to be you could just have somebody that that's all they do and it

00:18:27.11 doesn't impact you in any other way and I feel like teams are not utilizing the

00:18:31.17 fact that they could have a specialist in that position such as Gavin no I

00:18:36.17 agree I think I think you've I think you've found a glaring loophole

00:18:41.20 in the bylaw nfl bylaws that could be exploited uh to the extreme

00:18:46.18 can all teams share the same tosser or the same uh coin guy the the coin

00:18:51.22 I love the idea of another team hijacking the coin toss specialist next

00:18:57.14 season what a play that would be uh no I well I mean I I think per game I

00:19:02.10 don't know how that worked I guess it would depend on what contract and

00:19:06.02 exclusivity you signed with the person you deemed your

00:19:08.22 specialist could you here's the thing too that thing snowballs right like

00:19:12.13 let's say I don't know eric's favorite team the rams they uh they hire a coin

00:19:15.20 toss specialist they hire like like somebody from Vegas is a mentalist who's

00:19:19.05 really good at it right pro coin tosser goes really well it's so [ __ ]

00:19:23.02 successful that they put him on retainer on contract right he's now like on

00:19:27.06 contract with the the eric's favorite team the rams and uh and then other

00:19:32.03 [ __ ] teams start to do it how long until teams are trading coin tossers

00:19:36.20 back and forth like players they're like more valuable I

00:19:40.09 would love to see the court does trade it's like all right we'll trade Adam

00:19:43.20 vinatieri and and this mentalist for uh two first-round draft picks it

00:19:49.12 would be such low value it's like when you're trying to do a trade in monopoly

00:19:54.01 and someone's like throwing their get out of jail free card into the mix it's

00:19:59.09 like wow 50 bucks literally they know they jaywalked right before like it added.

00:20:04.23 [Music]

00:20:06.23 I agree I I think it would be amazing and uh it's something teams should take

00:20:10.12 advantage of it's it's upsetting that they don't there's another just like

00:20:14.17 quick other pivot for rules for a moment

00:20:17.18 you're not allowed to block a field goal that's going in

00:20:20.04 under the grounds of like if you so it's

00:20:22.23 it's impossible first of all because the ball is flying like 30 feet too short

00:20:27.04 too short but if you were able to do it they could still disqualify it on the

00:20:31.17 grounds of that's just unfair so like if you it's like a weird like side rule

00:20:36.06 where if you if you had a team of players drag a tree

00:20:39.21 out in the middle of the play to block the kick it's I mean there's technically

00:20:43.20 no rule against that but it's unfair I like that that's what you go you go for

00:20:47.13 a get a treat you you don't go for something that's actually doable like

00:20:53.01 throw a helmet or kick a shoe or I or how about you how about you have

00:20:57.02 like taco fall or minute bowl or Lexie pokemon team did that well

00:21:01.10 seven and a half foot tall dude who just shows up to block extra point I don't

00:21:05.02 know why they don't do that no they they did that there's a team that did that

00:21:08.08 and it didn't work because he's even at like seven feet tall you're way too

00:21:12.09 short for how high the ball goes that's like a thing that was the initial

00:21:16.12 setting of the rule but it's just I love the clarification it's unfair like just

00:21:21.22 there's no specifics to that what do you deem as unfair and I would argue Gavin

00:21:27.20 it's easier to drag a tree out onto the field than it is to hit a field goal

00:21:33.09 kick with your helmet by throwing it I agree I I feel like if you can if you

00:21:38.00 can throw a helmet at a kicked ball you deserve to block the field goal

00:21:42.13 yeah you should actually get points for that I just really want to see them like

00:21:46.16 staple a jersey to the front of a tree and have it on a wagon and just see a

00:21:51.16 team of like 11 guys immediately try to pull it out that or

00:21:56.15 it's probably hard to hit a field goal with a helmet but there's 11 people on

00:22:01.18 the field so what if you're throwing 11

00:22:05.14 helmets at once it's like you're carpet bombing

00:22:08.17 it's like that the uprights with helmets that makes a pretty good wall when a

00:22:14.13 plane takes off through like a flock of birds that blows out one of these

00:22:20.08 that's the new defense like they don't even rush the kicker

00:22:24.08 everybody just stands in place and throws their helmets in the air like

00:22:28.23 it's a graduation I just hope oh my god we are innovating he's in the nfl

00:22:34.06 yeah we are I feel like we're gonna I've been thinking a lot about 2022 that's

00:22:37.23 next year right 2022 that's the one yes yeah is this the last one of 2021 uh I'm

00:22:43.16 gonna need some Eric on that this is the

00:22:46.19 last one of 2021 okay well that's good I was trying to I was thinking about next

00:22:48.08 year and then I realized this is about an hour ago then I realized I don't know

00:22:52.02 what this year is and I had to sit down and figure out it was 20212021 still

00:22:56.21 uh so next year's 2022 I've been thinking about content uh and what we

00:23:02.19 can do and uh I think I I think that we can

00:23:05.00 hit sports in a big way next year and maybe this is it maybe we need to like

00:23:10.17 but maybe we need to we we need to be rule innovators in in professional sports

00:23:15.14 I think that'd be great that's push plus no no that's that's not post plus thank

00:23:20.04 you that's a football he's got a squeaky football

00:23:23.11 nothing else on earth matters or has mattered to Henry Hatfield

00:23:27.18 in the last 60 days other than this [ __ ] football and it is resilient he

00:23:32.21 usually destroys the squeaky toy by now or the the squeaking mechanism this

00:23:37.23 thing is going strong I don't know if the audience has ever noticed but you

00:23:43.03 only hear the squeaks when Geoff's talking that's because I assume nick has

00:23:47.23 to cut out the squeaks of the other time during the podcast

00:23:53.14 it's constant work it's one of my favorite trends to hear somebody else

00:23:58.14 talking and like nobody else speaking except you

00:24:01.21 just hear the squeak just in the background what's funny too is

00:24:07.07 is like and and I I truly believe this dog is as intelligent as a human just

00:24:12.21 just doesn't have the vocal cords because this [ __ ] has been in

00:24:17.07 this room with me all day I've had three meetings in here

00:24:19.23 like hour long meetings he is silent he doesn't care but he knows like he knows

00:24:25.09 when faith starts it's time to start squeaking he doesn't do it on other

00:24:29.13 podcasts that I sit in on other videos that I guess then on no conference calls

00:24:34.20 no zoom calls no nothing but this particular podcast he's like he's like

00:24:39.09 wakes up he's like oh [ __ ] I'm sorry I'm on the clock I gotta get to it it's

00:24:44.04 bizarre oh man I just looked at him and the way he's sitting I saw thr into his

00:24:48.04 [ __ ]

00:24:50.17 There's a lot of dog butthole.

00:27:09.03 Hello fresh america's number one meal kit

00:27:14.15 have you ever seen those little things that that people like put around the

00:27:20.13 tails of their cats and stuff and it like drapes a little

00:27:24.15 uh anus blocker down so it like hangs in front of their arsenal like

00:27:28.11 like an [ __ ] curtain yeah it's like if you don't want to see

00:27:31.17 your cat's anus don't get a cat like what that's the most what if we sold a

00:27:36.15 face anus curtain I hate this oh is that a kitty butt plug oh that's

00:27:42.10 even worse because that seems sick no it's not bad it doesn't go in their ass

00:27:47.11 what Eric showed is no I think that's hanging around his tail singing around

00:27:51.18 its tail oh it looks like it almost looks like a

00:27:55.09 metal evolver they put that inside the cap

00:27:57.19 I'm looking at a tiny thumbnail of a cat

00:27:59.19 with a blue disc sticking out of its ass I don't know how it got there I don't

00:28:05.05 I don't I the here's my issue with this product to me it implies that you're

00:28:11.04 looking at your cat's [ __ ] so much that you bought a product to stop doing

00:28:15.06 it that you just naturally weren't the fact that you had to spend money to get

00:28:19.22 rid of this problem I don't it's just it's a strange vibe that that gives

00:28:24.09 yeah it's kind of like it's kind of like at that point like you're the one that

00:28:27.12 keeps looking yeah the way that nick is defending this

00:28:31.07 product it's like he owned six of them it's like he's a pig

00:28:35.18 nick is sitting on a cache of these things uh that that being said

00:28:39.19 this is a product I want to sell now that I know it exists I absolutely

00:28:44.06 want to put a face logo on that so you should make sure it's not cruel like it

00:28:47.20 doesn't get in their way when they're cleaning themselves and stuff because oh

00:28:51.19 it doesn't seem right to hang something over the anus of another creature

00:28:56.19 yeah we do it to ourselves all day every day oh that's true

00:29:02.23 like I've never Gavin you and I have been friends how old are you 30 what 30

00:29:08.12 233933 years old I've known you since you were 15. So what is that 28 years 15

00:29:13.19 years whatever I don't know whatever the matter is

00:29:18.06 18 years uh I've never seen your [ __ ]

00:29:20.21 I've never come close to seeing your [ __ ] you've never seen my penis

00:29:24.09 either I've never seen your penis unfortunately that doesn't go that

00:29:28.13 conversation we can't say that both ways uh you've seen my penis so much but uh

00:29:33.05 but yeah I have no idea what your butthole looks like

00:29:35.22 um I mean I don't entirely know I've never sort of yeah got in front of a

00:29:40.05 mirror it's not an easy thing to get a look at uh what percent of Gavin have

00:29:45.12 you seen asks Eric you must have seen knight

00:29:49.16 you see me in like swim trunks I've seen I would say I've seen like 87

00:29:53.22 of Gavin I've probably seen ten percent of Andrew yeah I'm trying to think like

00:29:59.12 how do I even equate that hands and face pretty much um

00:30:03.14 as a big shorts guy I feel like ten percent is a low

00:30:08.02 number I think a pants guy you can maybe make that case

00:30:11.18 I mean if if I'd ever seen your back I would probably have seen 80 percent of

00:30:16.00 you I assume because it is back yeah you're right you're

00:30:20.08 right that's actually a great point it is 80 back

00:30:23.17 I have a question for you Gavin okay because we're talking about Geoff and I

00:30:26.22 were talking and it kind of relates to something else we should talk about that

00:30:29.23 we're actually gonna sell that we haven't mentioned on the show yet um

00:30:35.07 yeah but before we get to that I just I'd love to hear gavin's thought on this

00:30:40.05 if you were if you were to sell a niche product for face and you knew it would

00:30:44.14 be like it would be fine it would be profitable people would buy it doesn't

00:30:48.12 matter what it is what would you pick oh my god I think I'll be something

00:30:52.14 funny no it could be whatever you want it doesn't have to be funny at all

00:30:57.18 um one of those things that goes over over the bread bag to keep it closed

00:31:02.06 I what do you mean like well like I clicked like like a bread clamp not

00:31:06.20 necessarily a clamp sometimes you get those things where it's kind of like a

00:31:11.05 those plastic it's like a dog it looks like a dog tag with like a little

00:31:15.16 divot cut in the middle and you just kind of shove it

00:31:18.15 over the spun around bread packet looks kind of like henry's anus actually

00:31:23.22 now that I think about it I don't feel like I'm imagining the

00:31:26.19 right thing or Geoff is wildly incorrect based on that description I'm thinking

00:31:31.14 of the thing that closes the bread like when you buy it from the store one of

00:31:36.04 those plastic clips right yeah I'm thinking of the hold on I'm gonna

00:31:41.09 pull up I would immediately like I appreciate I mean that's uh

00:31:46.03 that's loading um oh yeah okay that's just a

00:31:49.03 fascinating way to uh describe that yeah Geoff holy [ __ ] that came out on my

00:31:54.12 birthday June 19th that's awesome

00:32:00.06 that's [ __ ] badass me and me and the bread clip have the same birthday

00:32:10.06 the bread expired

00:32:14.23 look at a picture like that do you ever wonder who took that like who thought

00:32:20.20 I'll get a close-up of this and post it was it taken specifically for Wikipedia

00:32:26.17 I don't yeah oh dude that's the official Wikipedia one that's amazing

00:32:35.07 that's so good I don't know what that means but it means it definitely means

00:32:40.20 something yeah I love it face one of them I I do use those I never use those

00:32:47.16 after the first use are you are you a are you like a spinner

00:32:52.10 and then crusher kind of guy yeah

00:33:02.13 is is what you do what's a spin and tuck

00:33:05.09 it's exactly what we just described yeah

00:33:08.02 you spin it and then you you put the the other end under the bread and let

00:33:11.10 gravity handle it yeah I do that as well

00:33:13.07 but only after that piece of [ __ ] little

00:33:15.02 clip breaks on the second because they suck

00:33:18.00 so if we had I mean that one's probably good that's a display model I'm sure

00:33:20.22 that one's made out of titanium or something but yeah what if we had a high

00:33:25.07 quality aluminium custom cut face bread closer

00:33:29.12 I don't think you'd be a spin and tuck guy after that what if it was really

00:33:34.20 nice and smooth to put on too you didn't have to like get it caught in the

00:33:38.15 plastic it was just like a deluxe premium item

00:33:41.02 I love this idea because I feel like this product was invented and hasn't

00:33:45.02 been innovated on since that time it's been the exact same for however many

00:33:49.04 years we can even make it collectible yeah collectible bread clip yeah like

00:33:53.18 everyone has a different date on it and there's one for every day of the year

00:33:57.19 you know how we can get away with this too this is this is how we capitalize on

00:34:02.10 this this is great this is the new metal straw do you

00:34:05.05 remember when everybody got all up in arms about straws and then they were

00:34:08.13 like holy [ __ ] they're destroying the environment this is plastic too we gotta

00:34:12.03 eradicate plastic bread clips they're destroying the fish that's a fish killer

00:34:17.01 right there you're looking at that thing murdered a trout you need a metal

00:34:21.07 aluminium permanent bread clip you buy it once you have it for the rest of your

00:34:25.11 [ __ ] life and you save the fish save the world think about future generations

00:34:29.22 think about our children for god's sakes but they selling the bread just open

00:34:33.18 them like how are they closing in the stores probably with a twist height

00:34:39.09 I thought you were saying I thought your point Geoff was that we

00:34:43.12 make an alternative to that yeah and then it just the whole world adopts the

00:34:49.03 face bread clip yeah we take it over I love it I like this idea a lot I feel

00:34:52.15 like I must have 10000 of those in my house because I lose every one and I've

00:34:56.10 never seen them again I don't know where they go I have pieces of 10000 of them

00:35:00.20 for sure why do you keep them what do you mean you said you had a load of them

00:35:06.03 they get lost yeah like I they I lose them immediately

00:35:10.03 and I've never seen them again so I feel there's some okay so they have us

00:35:14.09 ours needs to be magnetic then so you can have like a little

00:35:18.06 storage spot for it when you when you've got no bread in

00:35:21.20 and then you know exactly where it is every time you buy bread

00:35:24.21 I love it okay well if it has to whatever we do it has to be compatible

00:35:29.14 with the the wrist pocket and how that carries whether it's velcro

00:35:34.04 or velcro whatever it is that needs to be part of that I feel like we've gotten

00:35:38.01 off track on some of our wrist innovations the last couple weeks which

00:35:41.01 I get I mean it's the holidays we've got

00:35:41.18 a lot going on there's a lot of business to close at the end of the year so I I

00:35:46.04 think that we're going to dive back into that early early in 2022.

00:35:49.16 Uh and I I agree with you I think this is we're going to end up oh my god we're

00:35:53.16 going to have the most amazing utility belt of dumb [ __ ] when we're done with

00:35:59.03 this thing speaking of dumb ideas I just literally

00:36:01.22 just had the best dumb idea while while you guys were talking about this I was

00:36:05.12 thinking of [ __ ] we could sell that people don't currently sell that make so

00:36:09.18 much sense we sell two left socks right that's a dumb joke that we have because

00:36:13.21 of my sock issue uh we kind of you know what nobody saw the left left sock in

00:36:17.20 the right leg yeah we saw the left left sock and the

00:36:21.05 right left stock do you know what nobody on earth sells

00:36:25.14 go for it bread a pair of socks that has an extra sock three socks three socks

00:36:31.04 because you always lose a strong sock in the dryer right so you buy buy us buy a

00:36:35.08 pack of socks but it has a third extra sock then you set that aside and in a

00:36:39.17 month when you can't find your extra your other [ __ ] sock because you did

00:36:43.04 your laundry and it's gone forever you just break out the extra sock boom it's

00:36:47.18 the same thing as when you buy a button-up shirt and they sew that extra

00:36:51.12 button on the inside it's like they sew a shirt onto the inside of the shirt it

00:36:56.06 makes no sense no it makes total sense that makes total sense

00:37:00.09 everybody loses socks no I haven't I have a side of a drawer full of full of

00:37:05.14 unmatching socks because socks go lit missing constantly this

00:37:09.18 nobody should ever sell two socks again you should only sell socks and pairs of

00:37:13.01 threes but if you're worried about it buy two pairs of everything four is

00:37:16.06 better than three why would you ever want three because there's at least 20

00:37:20.06 extra you can use both pairs until you drop one ludicrous that's ludicrous why

00:37:25.18 stop before buy a hundred I agree with Geoff I think all socks

00:37:28.23 I do they need to be sold in odd numbers

00:37:31.08 and then you have a separate drawer that is you're for not in new socks and then

00:37:36.00 whatever you're missing you lose a sock you go into the non-use socks

00:37:40.00 immediately you have spares if you have four there's no waste from

00:37:44.12 storage spares you just have socks all the time that can be worn no because

00:37:49.13 then I'll be upset that I've now lost okay so if I have three socks

00:37:53.20 let's say I have four let's say I have two pairs right I lose one sock now I

00:37:58.23 have a pair and a half and then I might lose another then I have one pair if I

00:38:04.23 have the psychology behind it yeah if the worst case scenario being what you

00:38:09.22 want you were like no no no no no it's not right it will happen but

00:38:14.23 instead of losing two pairs I have just gained one because I had a third

00:38:20.03 exactly when I buy four socks I can't like even if I'm buying say I buy a pair

00:38:24.09 of socks that comes with two extras I'm not buying a pair of socks that comes

00:38:28.00 with two extras I'm buying two pairs of socks so that when I lose one of the

00:38:31.22 socks now I'm down a pair of socks that [ __ ] sucks but if I only buy one pair

00:38:36.00 of socks and then I lose a sock if I can break out the extra then I'll back up a

00:38:41.07 pair it makes total sense oh my god we got to do this tomorrow

00:38:44.09 I just Geoff and I looking at a package that says one pair of socks plus two

00:38:49.05 spares it'd just be like you can't [ __ ] trick me that's just two pairs

00:38:54.00 I'm buying this [ __ ]

00:38:57.01 oh my god psychopaths no we're gonna be rich psychopaths we're gonna be sitting

00:39:02.20 in a [ __ ] pile of gold that sucks and then you know what we're gonna do once

00:39:06.17 we got all that [ __ ] sock money Gavin we're gonna buy your bread clip right

00:39:10.17 from underneath yeah we're gonna Jason and then there's nothing you can do

00:39:14.15 about it you two are both about just kidding yourself it's like people who

00:39:18.17 set their clocks 10 minutes but what

00:39:22.13 did you travel in time 10 minutes you [Laughter]

00:39:34.08 catch up to your mouth it is one of my favorite things oh oh [ __ ]

00:39:40.17 hey you know oh my god I wish I did.

00:39:46.21 I have I have two product ideas okay before Geoff I forgot I forgot you asked

00:39:52.14 me this question yeah that's how we got saying what you wanted to come up with

00:39:56.08 well do you want to say yours Geoff because

00:39:59.07 yours were great too I don't feel like yeah my bad

00:40:03.00 mine are toilet related typically uh I wanted I would like to sell face bidets

00:40:08.00 uh I mean we already humped bidets for for [ __ ] advertisers right so why not

00:40:13.00 and it's something that I use every day of my life multiple times a day it's

00:40:16.12 something that's brought me a lot it's changed my life so I think

00:40:19.22 so so in Siri in all seriousness a face branded bidet I think would be great

00:40:23.08 because I feel like it'd be it'd be spreading cleanliness to the world and I

00:40:27.04 want to promote that the second one is more of a joke I think we should sell

00:40:30.06 giant pink port a potties I think that would be fun too

00:40:34.10 full size like functional yeah like why you always go down you always

00:40:39.05 go down to like the park or like at a construction site and you see it's like

00:40:44.04 shitimatic or like whatever their [ __ ] brand is you know the turd bird

00:40:49.01 or whatever why not one face yeah

00:40:53.07 yeah I feel Facebook for your butt it'll be cool to be at venues like when

00:40:58.02 you see them all in a line like like festival [ __ ] if they all just said

00:41:03.12 face on him I just feel like no one's going to buy a one-off face

00:41:07.23 bog I I suggested we get some like bootleg legos and have a build your own

00:41:12.12 [ __ ] type thing have your little set which could be great

00:41:16.09 to which I suggested we should sell dioramas of andrew's apartment room

00:41:22.12 let people like let people navigate around and move the sushi container and

00:41:28.00 yeah it'd be fun I wanted like a shot for shot remake of

00:41:31.21 that halo 3 diorama trailer but with all just [ __ ]

00:41:36.19 was was that halo 3 or was that reach it was halo 3. Because it was master chief

00:41:42.12 that was an amazing amazing commercial so I have two product ideas and one of

00:41:46.05 them Geoff knows about okay okay wanna do should I go with the

00:41:49.23 one you know about Geoff or should I go with the one I have today because I

00:41:53.03 think the one I have today is a real [ __ ] winner as well oh let's let's go

00:41:56.12 go with the old one and then we'll then okay so the first one this is like a

00:41:59.12 string I can't wait to get your reaction

00:42:01.11 this you know the channel Gavin uh where it's just a burning log and it's for

00:42:05.15 like they played over the holiday season yeah I want us to do one of those but

00:42:10.00 there's like no bit I just want us to make one of those and I want to be the

00:42:14.17 log guy because I feel like I'd be a great log guy I watched this guy

00:42:18.12 yeah he like throws an extra log in he pokes the fire he distributed he keeps

00:42:22.04 the flame going you gotta have good technique I'll watch those for a long

00:42:25.05 time and I've got a lot of opinions on log technique some of them the guy just

00:42:29.00 has no log management skills at all his placement is all off I would love to do

00:42:33.05 one of this did you just see the log guy yeah every once in a while you see the

00:42:36.10 hand come into frame and they start poking it with the fire poker and they

00:42:40.00 throw another log in the log management by some people in these tapes leaves a

00:42:44.00 lot to be desired and I think we could go in and fill this market up so we'll

00:42:48.04 just see like your arms and shins yeah you just see my arm come in every once

00:42:51.15 in a while while you see me throw a log in you see that fire be maintained I

00:42:55.09 will keep that fire going for the entirety of however long this tape is

00:42:58.18 you do realize there'll be tremendous judgment on your log management skills I

00:43:04.08 am right I've talked it up I've been practicing in the shadows for years

00:43:08.05 Gavin and I am ready to be judged I have an elite log management skill I believe

00:43:12.19 do you have access today to a to a fireplace no I do not you could

00:43:16.22 you need to get one seriously we need to get one we need to

00:43:20.09 film this and then we just need to put it up on the face YouTube channel with

00:43:25.05 military we should put the appropriate metadata on it oh

00:43:28.05 it's got a lube it's got to be hours long well it has to be so long like at

00:43:31.18 least eight hours yeah I'd assume yeah three hours of real time yeah eight

00:43:35.00 hours of real time because you gotta have real time to put new logs in you

00:43:39.11 gotta be able to display the log management skills

00:43:42.01 and this is exactly how many logs you'll need oh I've see you you think I don't

00:43:46.13 you don't think I'm a big [ __ ]

00:43:49.09 fireplace guy or my head in my head you're a little um

00:43:52.23 these are some [ __ ] you know what I was gonna I was gonna do it I was gonna

00:43:57.02 buy your dumb bread clip just as a gag it's not personal I'm not coming for

00:44:01.18 that bread clip I'm gonna get a patent in right now as soon as we're done

00:44:06.12 recording I'm I'm patenting our newborn no not our new version

00:44:09.12 not the new version with the magnets and whatnot.

00:44:13.12 I'm patting it can I say Andrew that this reminds me this is

00:44:18.00 in support of your phenomenal idea this reminds me of a conversation I just had

00:44:23.22 with my girlfriend on Sunday uh before I even knew about this before you even

00:44:27.17 posed this question to me and you explained the the fire idea to me my

00:44:31.07 girlfriend and I she we had a party at the house on Sunday uh for like uh or

00:44:35.17 like a work party for her and I on the tv just so you don't have like a

00:44:40.10 [ __ ] blame off tv I would turn on we turned on one of

00:44:43.05 those fire uh when I was like Christmas you know fireplace videos on YouTube and

00:44:48.15 then we got obsessed with trying to find the scene in it of where it uh of where

00:44:53.16 it it repeats because it's clear that the log is not burning down and we

00:44:58.16 probably [ __ ] around with that thing for throughout the course of the night

00:45:02.00 probably spent about two I probably spent about 20 minutes staring at that

00:45:05.15 thing just trying to catch it repeating and never able to and just driving

00:45:10.10 myself mad trying to figure out if the log was actually burning down or if it

00:45:14.08 was just if it was just repeating and uh I I'm all about it I think it's I I now

00:45:20.05 it's all I can think about is uh I want I want to watch a fire

00:45:24.14 actually go down over the course of like eight hours I don't want to watch

00:45:29.11 three minutes of a fire on Luke for six hours no those are [ __ ] I want to

00:45:33.12 watch eight hours of Andrew tending a fire and I wish we I wish I could film

00:45:37.12 it today I could film it here I have a gas fireplace unfortunately so it would

00:45:41.07 be boring and lame we should future proof it we should shoot it in like 8k

00:45:45.18 or something oh my god that's a great idea [Music]

00:45:49.20 8k of footage of this do you have the ability to shoot an 8k Gavin yeah

00:45:57.16 okay coming in 2022

00:46:00.15 at some point some point during year three season

00:46:04.13 three four or five potentially face is going to release an eight hour

00:46:10.12 fire tending film on YouTube that is going to you will ring in every holiday

00:46:15.18 for the rest of your life in stunning 8k it is going to be so crisp and the fire

00:46:21.17 is going to be so well tinted you'll swear you can feel the heat I'm going to

00:46:26.19 need some more memory cards

00:46:29.11 how big will that file be 20 terabytes [Laughter]

00:46:35.22 like I cannot most of the year to figure it out oh yeah

00:46:40.08 this is product 2 I mean first one I mean that sounds viable within itself

00:46:43.22 that's happening now that's locked in second one I think we could do it's a

00:46:48.00 summer item so I think we're going into the season for it it's it's perfectly

00:46:53.16 timed um this is what I want to do let me save a photo of this um summer what

00:46:58.06 is a staple of summer summer fun it's outside you're gonna play

00:47:02.17 what what is a great childhood item a toy I guess you could call it

00:47:07.03 paddling pool paddling pool is a great flip inside right nick um

00:47:12.13 slip and slide a slip inside is a is a fantastic thing my images don't want

00:47:17.18 update so I'm not going to use an example I'm just going to explain it

00:47:19.11 this is what I want slip and slide you know how they have like those things

00:47:23.10 that you can inflate over a slip and slide or maybe it's like a little bit to

00:47:26.21 the left of it well I want one of those oh it's just like a piece and sometimes

00:47:30.20 it's an elephant sometimes it's just like a visual prop it doesn't

00:47:34.09 necessarily really matter I want a slip and slide where either to the left of it

00:47:40.02 or maybe directly in front of it is Pedro Martinez

00:47:44.12 and you can be don zimmer you run at Pedro Martinez then slide down the slip

00:47:49.09 and slide get the real don zimmer experience

00:47:52.04 I think we should do a zimmer slide is what I think we should sell is he

00:47:55.05 holding out like an inflatable arm at the end you just have to have hit you

00:47:58.08 right in the middle of the head and push you down

00:48:01.17 I'm open to ideas I just want to slip and slide with Pedro Martinez at the

00:48:08.02 front of it uh I I think we should fully investigate that and uh

00:48:11.21 assuming that we that for whatever reason Pedro Martinez is not on board

00:48:16.23 with this and obviously he and the zimmer estate would be uh but if we run

00:48:20.12 into any kind of licensing issues when you were saying I thought you kept

00:48:24.06 saying slip inside and that got me thinking what if we made a slip inside a

00:48:28.06 slip and slide that's got a like it's like a tube that you uh it's like

00:48:32.18 inflatable and then so you slip it's like instead of going on a slip n slide

00:48:37.12 you go through a slip inside and then you call it slip inside okay

00:48:42.00 no no no no no no something in it I don't know it's like

00:48:45.23 I can round this idea out when you enter the tunnel as you

00:48:50.06 progress through it it goes

00:49:03.01 which perfectly segues to what we need to talk about [Music]

00:49:11.07 nick doesn't dick doesn't know about this he wasn't here

00:49:14.21 Eric tell nick tell dick what it sounds like hey nick we have uh we talked about

00:49:20.04 on our last break [ __ ] uh we needed to uh create a new piece of thing that you

00:49:27.06 know that tube that turns over that goes

00:49:30.06 yeah they're called grown tubes and baby we're making them

00:49:35.09 it's it's better than that nick and and I'd like to apologize to the audience uh

00:49:40.03 we we made a uh we made a promise a long long time ago maybe promises a strong

00:49:43.18 word made a statement a long long time ago that we were gonna try to keep uh

00:49:49.07 Maine uh like main face canon out of the

00:49:52.10 side stuff like the face break [ __ ] is

00:49:54.17 is like side content I don't want if you just wanna listen to podcast I don't

00:49:58.01 want you to miss stuff by that happens in the in the break [ __ ] because you

00:50:02.04 don't want to watch that content I get it but unfortunately something happened

00:50:06.13 so brilliant on the last break [ __ ] that they as the episode was starting

00:50:12.01 which by the way feel free to watch this on YouTube or the rusty site it's a

00:50:15.22 phenomenal video as the episode was starting uh

00:50:19.16 the guys got into a conversation about those grown tubes and what they were

00:50:24.15 called and before the episode was over merch had our ecom had already had

00:50:28.19 already mocked up and locked up a version of it and submitted we approved

00:50:33.16 it Eric approved it and we had already submitted the order

00:50:38.08 they are on their way right now before the face break [ __ ] episode was over

00:50:41.22 this product was on order and we're gonna call it the [ __ ] stick and I think

00:50:46.08 it's phenomenal and I we also discovered I'd never I'd

00:50:49.20 never seen or heard of these things before I don't know how you've avoided

00:50:55.01 them it makes no sense they didn't exist when I was a kid it was three people on

00:50:58.23 set just going

00:51:01.12 and Geoff going what what what it was perfect should we all do it now should

00:51:06.09 we all do at the same time to recreate what it was like yeah go ahead

00:51:16.15 so if you uh if you didn't watch the face break [ __ ] you missed an hour and a

00:51:22.11 half of that

00:51:24.13 anyway I thought that was that was a brilliant example of of creativity and

00:51:30.12 action had the idea and before the show was over it was it was already

00:51:35.04 being built I [ __ ] I don't know when they're going to come out but you can

00:51:38.23 watch it all on YouTube you can yeah yeah yeah we have YouTube it's going to

00:51:42.10 be go and you I'll be honest I'm not trying to market our [ __ ] here or

00:51:45.18 anything far be it but you should probably go to that YouTube channel and

00:51:49.11 bookmark it anyway because in some six months to a year the world's best 8k

00:51:53.07 fire footage is going to come out and you're going to want to go back and

00:51:56.13 watch I I would be terrible for the environment

00:51:59.20 but it would be really funny to do one of those where it is one of those videos

00:52:03.14 for like seven hours and then the fire leaves the fireplace

00:52:08.04 and then by like the end of the stream the entire house around it burns down

00:52:13.01 it's just everything's destroyed it just slowly zooms out

00:52:16.00 catches it on fire yeah or maybe it never even leaves frame it's just like

00:52:19.04 you you kind of pull out from the beginning and can see the whole

00:52:22.02 fireplace it's gonna be like right up in it like it typically is and just like I

00:52:26.13 don't know maybe like a stocking catches on fire and then it just expands and

00:52:30.18 then the whole wall eventually goes that'd be great terrible shouldn't do it

00:52:35.03 but be funny I mean worse is done for movies they burn [ __ ] all the time

00:52:39.03 that's fair true it's a very good point as long as you get the great that's all

00:52:42.20 that matters it is yes literally all that matters

00:52:46.09 I'm very excited to get my hands on a [ __ ] stick and make the noise because I

00:52:51.16 only know the noise through you guys and so I'm excited to see it in action

00:52:55.11 which movie has the worst carbon footprint do you think in terms of like

00:52:59.09 how much stuff like how much explosions or maybe something like Apollo 13 where

00:53:04.17 they actually kept doing like vomit comet to get the zero g stuff I bet that

00:53:10.15 was terrible for the environment oh man

00:53:14.00 I watched oh hold on do you talk amongst

00:53:17.01 yourselves I'm going to Google something I'm trying to think of

00:53:20.12 does it have to be that sound can we make it whatever we want like what is

00:53:24.23 how does that sound get created I think certainly the physics of it yeah I was

00:53:28.17 going to say nobody picked that sound that just had to have been the result of

00:53:32.19 there wasn't someone somewhat accidentally put something in the tube

00:53:36.00 once and went Jesus it's not like taking it back to breaking bad where

00:53:40.03 they're trying the different dipping sauces there's no guys sitting at a table

00:53:44.09 flipping those over to a variety of noises there was like that one I won

00:53:49.07 yeah I feel like they didn't audition [Laughter]

00:53:54.19 what do you think the alternative sounds would have been if they were creating

00:53:59.06 them deliberately I don't know but I like the idea of it being like a child

00:54:04.08 invented it it was just like dad I want a toy that goes

00:54:10.00 if a slide whistle is from heaven the stick thing is from hell oh absolutely

00:54:15.09 undeniable are you done go ogling chef yeah what is

00:54:19.22 Geoff doing yeah like what how long no I'm working I'm working working on what

00:54:24.20 he's like trying to find a movie I'm just trying to find him I watched a

00:54:29.18 movie uh last year we're talking about carbon footprint and just like

00:54:34.08 terrible things I watched feeling Eric in like he wasn't listening

00:54:38.07 been here the whole time I got it you don't have to reset it's a podcast

00:54:42.23 yeah I'm trying to find the name of the movie it was I

00:54:47.01 believe it was a an uh uh Michael antonioni film from the 60s and I

00:54:53.16 believe it starred Monica vidi uh but I can't seem to track it down anyway

00:54:59.18 the point is it was a really cool uh it was a really cool movie about uh

00:55:04.23 I don't know it's just that people in in Italy in the 50s that were uh

00:55:09.20 disconnected from their lives uh but it was kind of like uh it had kind of like

00:55:14.22 a weird like industrial almost like pre-David lynch industrial kind of like

00:55:20.17 portending that industrialization is going to destroy

00:55:25.13 uh society kind of bent to it and it was a black and white film

00:55:30.08 but they wanted to even such they wanted to

00:55:33.13 desaturate the world and so they cut a bunch of lead like silver paint

00:55:38.13 and gray paint and they painted all the trees and all of the nature

00:55:43.05 permanently with this paint and just killed

00:55:47.05 god Jesus Christ all the foliage in this area of Italy to make it look more

00:55:50.02 industrial then you know they didn't realize what they were doing at the time

00:55:53.12 but yeah it was just [ __ ] brutal and

00:55:55.09 I bet that kind of [ __ ] happened all the

00:55:55.09 time from like 1920 to like 1960. I was going to say Michael bay but I think

00:56:00.07 that's why I think you won I think you took it with that

00:56:04.08 yeah I was [ __ ] up it's terrible is it lenote

00:56:07.21 no it wasn't that one anyway I'll figure it out somewhere it's not important you

00:56:10.23 guys are never gonna watch it yeah well since we have to record two of these we

00:56:14.14 should wrap this up happy new year to everyone happy new year yes

00:56:18.21 absolutely what are you guys going to do

00:56:21.00 for new year what what I guess yeah what are your big new year's plans do you

00:56:24.08 guys have anything crazy you're going to do

00:56:26.13 new year's plans uh well immediately when we're done here I'm going to the

00:56:32.04 patins office and I'm going to file a new product called the edgewise.

00:56:38.05 [Laughter]

00:56:45.11 People were kicking off about edgewise comparing it to like

00:56:49.20 well what about like clockwise and it's like how does that make any sense either

00:56:55.09 you want to slowly rotate your point into a conversation

00:56:59.09 what are you on about there's nothing I love more than slowly rotating my point

00:57:03.18 into one of our podcast conversations it's something I strive for every show

00:57:07.16 we record

00:57:09.22 and that's a wrap on 2021. See you guys next year or whatever there's a little
