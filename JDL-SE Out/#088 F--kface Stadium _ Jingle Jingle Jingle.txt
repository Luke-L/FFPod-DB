00:01:06.08 very disappointed in you what do you mean you remain unpleasant you are just

00:01:11.21 as unpleasant as you were the previous week zero pleasantries for Gavin because

00:01:17.16 I showed up at one o'clock and you showed up at one once again

00:01:21.02 we had this whole thing I thought you bought in I thought you're gonna be a

00:01:25.03 pleasant guy going forward your mood would be better

00:01:28.00 still just as unpleasant I'll be honest I completely forgot about the

00:01:33.01 pleasantries of course you did you don't value the pleasantries this is well

00:01:38.02 established we have so many pleasantries outside of school

00:01:41.22 that doesn't count we have zero pleasantry scenarios outside of there's

00:01:47.12 one other thing okay I think for maybe maybe for episode 90 I'll attend the

00:01:53.03 pleasantries that you can't whatever is this well wait what episode this is 88

00:01:57.12 atm you're doing I thought you're doing a sneaky thing I thought we're doing 89

00:02:00.18 we're doing two today and you're like I'll be there before the start of the

00:02:04.13 90th one you're already here okay I'm gonna I'm

00:02:07.16 gonna hold you to that pleasant Gavin episode 90. Why don't you give me a

00:02:11.10 brief summary of today's pleasantries and what was covered and what I missed

00:02:15.02 okay uh we were talking about arena names our favorite sports arena names I

00:02:19.09 guess it doesn't have to be a sports arena although most arenas are for sports

00:02:23.18 uh we're discussing that all sorts of great names do you have a favorite arena

00:02:27.13 name either of you well I feel a little on the spot right now honestly uh

00:02:32.00 I haven't had time to think about all my all of the different arena names around

00:02:35.14 the world Gavin Hugo I don't know a lot of arena names I know

00:02:38.19 the ones that they uh made fun of in basketball like uh

00:02:41.21 maxi tampon stadium or whatever but they were all just funny jokes what are some

00:02:45.19 of the real ones are they funny jokes because that's how arenas are named like

00:02:49.00 I know that that's probably your joke but it also is just sort of how they are

00:02:54.02 yeah my personal one was uh the kfc yum center I love hearing

00:02:58.23 about the kfc yum center in Kentucky it'd be like when you watch a ufc event

00:03:02.23 they'll be like ufc 76 at the yum center two heavyweights going at like this is

00:03:08.12 such a uh Eric had a great one for I don't remember what city it was for is

00:03:14.04 new Orleans and they have the smoothie king arena or the smoothie king center

00:03:19.06 uh okay I have one uh the boca rat on bowl is the roof claim.com boca rat on

00:03:26.04 which I think is because uh so many roofs blow off in uh

00:03:31.16 in hurricanes in Florida uh that they that it's such a big industry that the

00:03:37.22 roof company uh the roof insurance company sponsored an entire bowl wow

00:03:42.12 henry's really hitting it hard today straight off the uh

00:03:46.06 it's a defiant thing so the other day I was doing a different podcast I think I

00:03:51.00 was doing the uh rt podcast from home and uh he started up and I had to take

00:03:55.16 the I I it's not that podcast they wouldn't get it you know so I had to

00:04:00.23 take the football away from him and so I th he was pissed off he has more

00:04:06.06 creative freedom while he's uh yeah for likes for like a day

00:04:10.01 and so I think that he's being defiant but also he's like checking like wait a

00:04:14.08 minute I thought the rule was I start squeaking when we're doing the podcast

00:04:18.00 and then I I don't think he understands the subtleties between like different

00:04:21.03 podcasts and so he's kind of looking at me right now with the football in his

00:04:24.15 mouth going like am I doing this or not like what

00:04:28.11 he has his role yeah exactly but there's no nuance to it that's the

00:04:33.19 problem maybe that will be seasoned by season six maybe he'll have a variation

00:04:37.22 of the squeak it won't be constant how much money does it take to get your name

00:04:41.13 on a stadium like what's the shittiest cheapest stadium you could get your name

00:04:44.15 on oh maybe the boca rat on bowl how many how many seats is a stadium

00:04:50.23 what's the smallest stadium I could have I certainly couldn't call a six-chair

00:04:56.17 building an arena world's smallest stadium is it a capacity thing or is it

00:05:02.06 just like a specific facility within the stadium that classifies it as a stadium

00:05:06.20 I don't know what defines a stadium does it need like eight food courts and then

00:05:10.16 it's a stadium [Laughter]

00:05:13.07 it needs to serve at least three different variations of hot dogs and

00:05:17.10 then it becomes a stadium we should look up the requirements because we could

00:05:21.09 potentially build a very small face stadium I can't get the link to work but

00:05:26.05 according to Google Eden park in new Zealand is widely considered as the

00:05:30.11 smallest international cricket stadium in the world but I don't know what the

00:05:34.00 [ __ ]

00:05:35.18 Eric says a stadium is a PlayStation venue outdoor sports concerts other

00:05:39.09 events consist of a field or stage either partly or completely surrounded

00:05:43.22 by a tiered structure so it just needs some heated speakers yeah yeah we could

00:05:48.07 absolutely make a stadium yeah because this one this qriket stadium has a

00:05:52.14 capacity of 15000 people I feel like we could come in way smaller than that 15.

00:05:57.09 Yeah 15 people before we get away from the names nick

00:06:00.11 said his favorite name was the chick-fil-a stadium or something like

00:06:05.01 that in Atlanta is that where the falcons play does that

00:06:08.01 still exist well the falcons play in Atlanta

00:06:11.18 I know they play in Atlanta I knew that part I didn't know what their

00:06:16.06 so did kanye west live in a chick-fil-a technically for a while did he live in

00:06:20.03 the stadium kanye west moved into the falcon stadium for a little bit he went

00:06:23.20 through this whole thing where he's living in stadiums they eventually

00:06:27.09 kicked him out is that when he was doing his like his like Sunday service thing

00:06:31.17 no I think like it was more recent than that oh I assume more people were aware

00:06:36.15 of kanye west stadium habits what kind of room did he have do you

00:06:39.13 have like one of them I don't it's a great question he moves stadiums now

00:06:42.21 because I feel like the playoffs were starting in the nfl or

00:06:46.12 something they're like you can't still be here you got to go I think it was too

00:06:51.01 loud it may have been the Sunday service stuff it was recent it was like within

00:06:55.06 the last three or four months huh and I don't remember where he moved I think he

00:06:59.12 moved to new Orleans he may have went from chick-fil-a to a smoothie king

00:07:04.06 potentially do you think that's a step up or a step

00:07:07.00 down or a lateral move going from a chick-fil-a uh I haven't had either but

00:07:12.11 I feel like there's a chick-fil-a is is a more I don't know

00:07:16.11 is has a company ever sponsored the name of a stadium and then not provided the

00:07:21.14 catering for the stadium like is there a chick-fil-a stadium that doesn't serve

00:07:25.07 chick-fil-a I would be shocked if the chick-fil-a stadium serves chick-fil-a

00:07:30.02 it's certainly not on a Sunday when they play football right [Laughter]

00:07:34.23 isn't that the point of chick-fil-a I guess yeah they closed on sun days

00:07:39.17 are they I've never been I've never I don't have any you've never eaten a

00:07:44.06 chick-fil-a in your life no I don't have any around here

00:07:47.09 good chicken nuggets man do they oh yeah what about compared to like mcdonald's

00:07:51.14 nuggets where would you how do you rank them uh how do I rank chick-fil-a

00:07:56.00 nuggets yes amongst other food nuggets yes I think they're better than

00:08:00.13 all the other fast food nuggets combined oh wow yeah they're like it's like a

00:08:06.03 different it's like a different level that's such a weird phrase I like the

00:08:09.12 idea of all the other fast food nuggets forming into a voltron line and it would

00:08:14.19 not be better that voltron nug would not compare yeah is it nugget only good

00:08:18.14 because of the ratio of the fried part to the internet like if you had a big

00:08:23.20 nugget steak would it be less delicious no I I have a chicken fried steak right

00:08:28.14 isn't isn't a chicken fried steak just a big chicken nugget oh is that what that

00:08:32.15 is I don't know what do you I think the most important

00:08:36.23 part of the chick nugget is the crunch for me it's just it's really the coating

00:08:43.02 the breading I want a nice crunch I will say the I agree when it comes to like

00:08:48.12 mcdonald's and those like that you're in it for the breading right but with

00:08:52.08 chick-fil-a it's good all the way through I will say does any nugget have

00:08:56.18 the fried pot on the inside oh like like an inverted nugget yeah it's there

00:09:02.06 an inver how would you do that [Laughter]

00:09:05.03 I'm sure that's doable you'd have to just you start with oh what if you

00:09:10.03 started with a tiny nug right okay wrap wrap that in chicken nugget again

00:09:15.01 and just keep doing it until it's like a nug sphere

00:09:20.13 I feel like if I were to show you that product that you just created you would

00:09:25.10 be annoyed by it you would hate it the thing you just invented in your head

00:09:29.06 you would if I showed you a photo you'd be like who has the [ __ ] time to do

00:09:33.00 that get out of here you would hate it I

00:09:35.07 love that you just invented that I think I would say you Andrew are quite an

00:09:38.22 expert in fast food because you've you know you've got the source empire idea I

00:09:43.06 think you could craft a really interesting unique fast food menu item I

00:09:47.22 need to think about that you're right I think I could do something in the space

00:09:50.23 I'm currently I'm I feel like I'm taking down mcdonald's right now I learned a

00:09:54.23 secret this changed my life my mcdonald's are you gonna reveal the

00:09:58.12 secret because you are gonna not reveal it I I'm on the fence I'm on the fence

00:10:02.22 about revealing it because it's so good it's changed it's changed my whole

00:10:06.21 ordering process you wouldn't even tell me about it why wouldn't you want to

00:10:10.10 share it why why would you want to hold on to this information because what if

00:10:13.14 they because it's they're they're making

00:10:15.14 a mistake Geoff the people the mcdonald's

00:10:19.05 is making a mistake I don't know if it's

00:10:22.06 local to my specific mcdonald's I have a feeling it's not are you already gonna

00:10:25.11 be patched I'm afraid that someone's gonna go tell

00:10:28.14 mcdonald's what they're doing and it's gonna get patched and there's a whole

00:10:32.02 other layer that I haven't I haven't talked to you you knew that I had a new

00:10:35.20 trick Gavin you don't even know the side benefit of what I'm getting

00:10:38.18 I'll say I'll [ __ ] say it because everyone I've told didn't know this was

00:10:43.12 the thing mcdonald's has a pancake happy meal they have a hot

00:10:47.08 cake happy meal for the morning but you get two

00:10:50.19 at least on all the promotional images that's what makes it like the kids meal

00:10:54.10 version of the hotcakes you just order hotcakes you get three

00:10:56.21 if you order the kids hotcakes you're supposed to get two

00:11:00.11 but they don't know this I just get three so I order the kids hot cakes

00:11:05.18 which comes with a drink it comes with a hash brown which is two dollars and

00:11:10.19 what should be two pancakes for I get three so for the price of essentially

00:11:15.00 one order of hot cakes I'm now also getting a drink and a hash brown and a

00:11:19.02 toy how are you getting three you're ordering three I'm ordering two but they

00:11:22.15 just give three because I don't think anyone actually knows what like people

00:11:25.20 don't seem to be aware that there's a hot cakes happy meal and nobody knows

00:11:29.14 what it is so they give three they just give a standard order of hotcakes

00:11:33.18 they're only supposed to give two so your secret to your secret uh cheat

00:11:38.23 is you order the hotcakes happy meal and

00:11:41.16 that's all you do well yeah because they give three

00:11:45.15 they give three hot cakes instead of two and they give you a toy

00:11:49.22 and you get a drink and you get a hash if I were to just order

00:11:53.15 if I didn't order this in happy meal right like I was just ordering all the

00:11:58.02 items of it the hotcakes the three hotcakes is like four dollars eighty

00:12:01.09 cents the hashbrown is two dollars the drink is like another dollar

00:12:05.18 I this is like an eight dollar meal I'm good for five dollars plus I get a toy

00:12:09.20 uh what's this it'll change my mornings that's a fantastic question Geoff what is

00:12:14.08 the toy now originally right now they're doing sing two toys is

00:12:18.03 their main thing who who wants that they're not great they're not great toys

00:12:23.01 but two times ago I open up my box and I got a [ __ ]

00:12:27.09 beanie baby I got a beanie baby how exciting is that the whole beanie baby I

00:12:32.12 got a whole beanie baby it was the greatest morning I've had in

00:12:35.14 quite a while it lifted my spirits I was excited about it then I realized the

00:12:41.03 beanie baby was from 2019

00:12:42.21 that beanie baby's just been hanging out in that mcdonald's since since before

00:12:46.12 the pandemic started the world has changed since that beatty baby was

00:12:50.15 delivered do you think it's even a mcdonald's beanie baby or do you think

00:12:53.16 they're at a point now where employees are just trying to get rid of [ __ ] they

00:12:57.09 don't want in their house I like your idea but I think it's a

00:13:00.17 mcdonald's beanie baby and I'll say I'll say why because I think they're out of

00:13:04.15 sync too stuff and so they're just giving away what they currently have so

00:13:08.04 I ordered happy meal this morning I got [ __ ] pokemon cards oh pokemon cards a

00:13:13.09 lot of people eat those now right I've been hearing that

00:13:16.02 I just can't imagine anything better at sucking up the fast food smell than the

00:13:20.22 material used in a beady baby that thing must smell terrible nice listen it's in

00:13:26.23 a bag it's got a bag keeps all this the oil stink out

00:13:31.03 I was gonna say it's gotta it's in a bag it's got a beak like the beak would be

00:13:36.08 don't forget to talk about things that would penetrate the bag is the better

00:13:42.04 option of the two what is the beanie baby uh it's uh it's guild of the flamingo

00:13:47.08 birthday February 262017. Gilda the flamingo I I gotta admit I'm slightly

00:13:52.15 let down by your get the [ __ ] out of here get out of here

00:13:56.12 I thought I was picking get out of here I I was picturing you like on the kiosk

00:14:01.01 being like uh like ordering on the screen being like well if you add this

00:14:04.06 and then uh subtract this and you'd order this without the thing and then it

00:14:08.00 comes and you get really you're just ordering a item from the menu

00:14:13.12 I have I've noticed a hole in their system I've noticed

00:14:17.05 what do they give to everyone I don't care about clearly

00:14:21.18 no they clear I I think listen why would they all started [ __ ] Eric

00:14:26.06 said I think your hack is good no it's a great hack because I'm stuck the hat

00:14:30.17 Gavin is you get for the price of three hot cakes you're not just getting a hot

00:14:35.08 cake I don't know how many times I have to say it you're getting a hash brown

00:14:38.13 you're getting a drink a delicious [ __ ] apple juice or a chocolate milk

00:14:43.22 or an orange juice your choice you can make it

00:14:47.12 it's just on the menu but it's at a cheaper price it's half the price

00:14:52.10 what do you want what do you [ __ ]

00:14:54.19 what did you expect me to say I ordered three big macs and a [ __ ] sprite and

00:14:58.13 it turns out they deliver a Porsche like what do you want me to say

00:15:03.01 what the heck well I think that the I think the hack

00:15:06.12 if you will comes down to your local mcdonald's doesn't know what they're

00:15:09.18 doing that's what I don't know that's the possibility like can you try a

00:15:13.06 different mcdonald's cause I looked it up on their website and it shows it even

00:15:16.16 says get two hot cakes with your choice of apples hash brown yogurt or a drink

00:15:20.21 so they're advertising it as two on the mcdonald's website so I don't know that

00:15:25.20 it's a hack as much as as you just have a mcdonald's that is playing fast and

00:15:30.21 loose with the rules the hack is that I don't think any mcdonald's knows that

00:15:34.16 they're only supposed to give two you know the Andy mcdonald's in on earth

00:15:39.01 knows even though the website knows all the marketing materials fast maturing

00:15:43.07 you think that the mistake that your local mcdonald's is making is global

00:15:47.10 well this is a perfect thing to talk about on a podcast we got plenty of

00:15:51.09 opportunities for field research I want to know people who order happy meals

00:15:55.23 get the hot cakes happy meal let me know how many hot cakes you get uh yeah get

00:15:59.07 it if you if it's through the course of something you already do don't go out

00:16:02.12 and buy a hot cakes happy meal just to give the mcdonald's corporation

00:16:06.12 money just for Andrew it's probably some secret like

00:16:09.12 you got some sort of a secret deal on the back end here where you said

00:16:12.15 mcdonald's no absolutely I no I don't have I don't

00:16:16.10 know any stocks in the mcdonald's company I'm not an investor I get no

00:16:20.07 benefit from this I did the stock market thing once and it didn't work the way I

00:16:26.12 hoped it would I lost money I bought pizza it was

00:16:30.12 it was during the pandemic I bought it's so stupid

00:16:34.13 I I bought pizza hut which is yum stock which is pizza hut I bought a single

00:16:39.20 share of yum my favorite arena uh which is taco bell kfc and pizza hut

00:16:46.10 and I was like I think they're gonna I think it's gonna go up today I think

00:16:50.11 today is a good I think people are going to get lunch from them today

00:16:54.12 and then I sold as soon as I bought it it tanked it went down then it went back

00:16:59.03 to where I bought it after maybe two hours and then I sold and I lost money

00:17:03.13 on the transactional fees of the process hard to be a day trader it is I got out

00:17:07.12 of the game so I don't know any mcdonald's stocks I have no incentive to

00:17:10.12 do that I'd just be curious because you're right I don't know that that is

00:17:14.04 the argument unlike [ __ ] gavin's dumb argument of it not being a hack in any

00:17:20.08 way expecting a [ __ ]

00:17:22.19 rainbow of gold to appear if you ordered six things in a certain way

00:17:27.08 someone's gonna be on my side about this no no I hear what you're saying I have

00:17:32.00 the reverse of that where I can't worry nick yes nick

00:17:35.11 what is what is next I'm on your side Gavin yeah I thought I thought it was

00:17:40.23 pretty clear that Geoff was on your side I'm right there with you wait

00:17:44.13 this isn't minor I thought Geoff was with

00:17:46.09 me why was I with you I thought Geoff was with you I thought you were

00:17:50.17 you seemed more supportive you're killing her are you supportive of the

00:17:54.01 hack yeah I thought you were like I'm saying that I don't think it's a

00:17:57.01 hack I'm saying I think that your mcdonald's doesn't know what the [ __ ]

00:18:00.08 they're doing that's possible okay well how did you get anything other than that

00:18:04.13 out of what I said Eric I just didn't think you just I didn't hear you dismiss

00:18:08.23 it as a hack I I just I immediately it was Geoff going well it sounds like your

00:18:13.07 mcdonald's just doesn't understand or did something okay

00:18:16.06 this is you're right this isn't I mean it was him saying it's not a hack

00:18:19.20 without saying okay I also said like this would mean that every mcdonald's on

00:18:23.22 the globe is doing it wrong and I don't think that's the case and then Andrew

00:18:27.12 was like this is my backdoor opportunity to sell some [ __ ] hotcakes and you

00:18:31.07 know I'm sure you get some sort of a vig on the back end from mcdonald's nope

00:18:36.18 I was just uh you're tell it was you did it politely Geoff all right I

00:18:42.08 apologize I misunderstood the support you broke my heart softly with it where

00:18:46.09 Gavin was just like this isn't I just don't I sometimes I thought Geoff you're

00:18:52.04 like this could be a good hack but it's not a hack

00:18:54.13 it raises the question that I ask myself all the time which is why do I talk

00:19:00.15 just generally like there's like a 40

00:19:03.05 percent chance gavin's listening to anything I say oh

00:19:07.07 I would give Andrew like a 70 but even if I if you guys are listening and and

00:19:12.12 everything I say is misconstrued anyway then just what's the point I I might as

00:19:16.01 well just sit back and enjoy the podcast I it's I feel the same way a lot of the

00:19:20.11 time not necessarily no you can't you can't feel the same way I already feel

00:19:23.18 that way that's why you can't steal my feelings no I'm stealing your feelings I

00:19:26.23 feel that you can't be a feeling appropriator how dare you I'm stealing

00:19:31.15 your feelings they're my insight [Laughter]

00:19:35.01 what about you Gavin what about me well what do you mean

00:19:39.05 in reference to I just stole jessie's feelings what about me

00:19:44.04 Kevin why are you in a bad mood today she's always in a bad mood no

00:19:50.06 I would say oh yeah I do try and listen I was just I think I was still

00:19:56.23 I was still just thinking about how it's so easy to hack mcdonald's

00:20:01.09 because they have those screens where you can like deduct and add different

00:20:05.07 things to different foods and sometimes you end up with like a negative balance

00:20:09.18 I got that but the other way they're [ __ ] me on the sausage it dries it's

00:20:14.20 upsetting to me I can't I can't just order I like a side

00:20:19.12 of sausage with the hot cakes right it's

00:20:22.07 the thing I enjoy I can't but there's no ability for me to order just a cider

00:20:27.00 sausage through the app oh it has to come in an English muffin is the best I

00:20:30.23 can do to get it but you don't want the bread pot it's cheese in the bread part

00:20:36.12 and I in that screen I can add an additional sausage for a dollar 25. So I

00:20:40.22 know how much it costs to order one and I can do it but I need the bread

00:20:46.04 part so if I wanted two just sausages I'd have to order one hot cake or not

00:20:51.03 hot the English muffin and then an additional but the math doesn't even

00:20:56.02 work out because you can also order a piece of cheese and an English muffin

00:20:59.18 and it costs more to do that than it would it none of it makes sense it's

00:21:03.20 chaos what is your goal is your goal to save money mainly or is your goal to get

00:21:09.01 one over on mcdonald's well it's started to save money and it

00:21:12.10 ended up being I'm getting one over on mcdonald's because I'm paying I'm paying

00:21:16.18 way less than I should be for what I'm getting so it's a double win imagine the

00:21:21.07 joy Gavin of thinking you're getting two hotcakes and you get three

00:21:24.22 and then thinking it's a mistake that would happen once and it's happened

00:21:28.00 every time nick asks how many times I've done it I've done it about four or five

00:21:31.14 times at this point I always and it's 100 consistency with your hack

00:21:35.18 a hundred percent consistency and the toy is changing every time I don't even

00:21:40.17 know it's going to be in that box it's a

00:21:42.16 mystery box every morning I thought they did away with toys

00:21:46.15 no you can get a book too but like why would I who [ __ ]

00:21:50.13 yeah who can read yeah [Laughter]

00:21:53.06 interesting I don't even know why I speak completely learning how to read

00:21:58.15 well congratulations on your hot cake hack thanks I think it's great that's it

00:22:04.01 that doesn't sound anything like a hack to me but uh let me be clear

00:22:09.03 I don't think it's a hack okay if if people order this that are pla based on

00:22:14.17 your words if people who are ordering hot cakes

00:22:17.14 naturally decide to order the happy meal

00:22:20.03 at what percentage do those need to come back with three for you to accept this

00:22:24.06 as a hack nick says once is a mistake four or five

00:22:27.09 times as a hack I disagree four or five times it's just a pattern it's just a

00:22:31.22 pattern of of uh miscommunication and poor workmanship I

00:22:35.14 think it's just an uneducated workforce that doesn't understand the work I just

00:22:50.04 or tell me privately while we're playing Taylor because he's scared mcdonald's

00:22:55.17 will plug this hole wait a second like somebody at corbett's

00:22:59.17 like what do you mean we're giving away an extra free hot key that's my fear

00:23:04.21 there's only two in the picture they're gonna put a press release out

00:23:08.03 that there needs to only be two it'll ruin everything I put a lot on the line

00:23:14.04 here and I didn't expect [ __ ] on for it god damn it

00:23:17.19 not even a secret menu item no well it's a secret you get three

00:23:22.18 if you would look at the [ __ ] photo you would not know you're getting three

00:23:26.04 hot cakes I just gave you a little bit more secret I don't cross-reference a

00:23:29.08 lot of food I get with the picture yeah I don't I guess that's fair I'm just

00:23:32.16 saying if you saw it I may have been hacking my entire life without knowing I

00:23:36.21 uh I will say that the mcdonald's that I

00:23:39.11 frequent kind of some but kind of close to my house uh

00:23:42.22 they've been going through some staffing problems which I think a lot of uh just

00:23:47.12 a lot of the establishments across the america have honestly uh but since then

00:23:51.19 it's kind of a crap shoot what I get when I order something like they're very

00:23:57.01 routinely do I order like a number one and end up with like somebody else's

00:24:00.18 crispy chicken sandwich or an extra fry I don't consider it a hack I uh I

00:24:05.05 consider it as a mistake and I feel like I feel like that's what

00:24:08.23 you're dealing with here I think nick made a great argument of if it's

00:24:12.14 consistently the same thing I think that's not a mistake I see what you're

00:24:16.08 saying I think it's just misinformation I think the only argument I will accept

00:24:20.02 is if it's just my mcdonald's failing at their job

00:24:23.13 then it's no longer a hack that's that's like a shareable thing okay that's

00:24:28.12 really the deciding factor for me well Eric and nick both think it's a hack now

00:24:34.08 um you know what hey Gavin you asked me what my cool [ __ ] my ridiculous item

00:24:38.17 would be it's ordering two hot cakes to getting four that's my [ __ ] cool item

00:24:43.19 cause getting an unexpected amount of hot cake it's called the hacker meal and

00:24:48.04 you get four four [ __ ] hot cakes we're following the sock logic is that

00:24:52.08 one spare or two uh that's one spare from a standard hotcake order four okay

00:24:59.09 yeah get one extra good that's on us we mentioned a birthday during that I

00:25:05.12 and I don't remember when or why someone's birthday was mentioned at some

00:25:09.08 point I feel like we need to call out that it was don zimmer's birthday a few

00:25:12.12 days ago oh yeah Monday it was don zimmer's birthday happy birthday to don

00:25:16.01 zimmer how old would he have been oh that's a great question no I know it's

00:25:21.01 it's a great question and I I want it to be known that I [ __ ] have learned

00:25:26.15 from my uh what was oh [ __ ] oh what was her name oh no oh no I haven't learned

00:25:32.06 anything apparently was it Leona waddell was that her basket woman the basket

00:25:35.23 woman yeah yep I had in my notes to bring up zimmer's birthday happening and

00:25:40.14 I knew that there would be a follow-up question before that I wasn't prepared

00:25:44.03 last time I believe zimmer would be 92.

00:25:47.09 Oh man we've got to do a blowout for his century we do really

00:25:52.04 should we really should 91 I was close do you guys think everybody uh

00:25:57.01 associated with this podcast will be alive in eight years ooh um we could try

00:26:01.02 we could make a good effort I don't want to go down this route yeah

00:26:05.03 well I will certainly endeavor to be alive

00:26:07.16 Eric said no but he won't say who I'm kind of I kind of right there with you

00:26:11.09 yeah if everybody [ __ ] starts getting three hot cakes you know who took me out

00:26:17.11 you know who came for me Ronald McDonald is a menace is he still

00:26:21.10 around Ronald no he's gone oh like his caboose it's been stolen it's been taken

00:26:26.05 no longer they've gotten rid of all traces of Ronald McDonald this is I want

00:26:31.18 to say I'm I'm I'm happy that this episode the last so we have we have uh

00:26:36.09 an intern listening to this episode that came with Eric this has happened once

00:26:39.16 before do you remember the last time this happened that we had an intern

00:26:44.04 listening as you recall yes was it the uh I bet you do I sure do

00:26:48.07 was it the condiments it was the condiment episode I feel like we have

00:26:52.06 enough distance where we could talk about the condiments

00:26:55.23 it was by far our condiment argument is not just within the context of the show

00:27:01.16 the most argumentative heated uncomfortable conversation I've ever had

00:27:06.01 with Geoff by far in our friendship I'd say as a whole between all of us

00:27:11.05 it was the worst conversation we've ever had and it was recorded

00:27:16.00 and it's bad I feel like it probably sounded bad in the edited release it was

00:27:21.11 oh unbelievably worse in the moment here's the problem when I get mad yeah

00:27:28.10 so it was edited in such a way that didn't

00:27:32.12 it was edited in such a way that I agree with by the way that I fully support

00:27:37.12 that took that took away a lot of my arguments that I think made my point but

00:27:43.02 unfortunately I made them in such a mean way that they needed to be removed.

00:27:51.11 I think you guys understand what I'm saying here right no I didn't yeah oh

00:27:57.01 yeah I was there I I think I was right but I was right in such a such an angry

00:28:02.14 angry way that as nick is saying it took a lot of context away from me yeah I uh

00:28:08.01 I really faced myself in being improving my point in the moment but

00:28:12.05 proving it in such a cruel way that we had to cut it I I feel like I don't you

00:28:16.11 definitely proved that condiments and what is the sauce what is it is a

00:28:20.06 [ __ ] impossible there's no good answer there's gonna like there's I feel

00:28:24.12 like it's so hard to make a judgment I would say it was more of a condiment

00:28:28.13 hack

00:28:30.17 nick said it it took away it absolutely took away context from Geoff uh if I

00:28:36.05 could have had you retake those lines it would have worked

00:28:40.02 I would love a version where you're like really really agitated

00:28:44.05 but all the lines you adr are like really upbeat and jolly and just cut in

00:28:49.03 amongst the uh the sour saltiness I was a whole thing where I didn't

00:28:54.04 realize that you were a it was whatever it was the worst thing the

00:28:57.08 worst conversation we've ever had and it was recorded on a podcast and it was a

00:29:02.01 weird argument and it was in front of an intern it was the only it's the closest

00:29:06.07 thing we've had to a live audience that wasn't like regularly part of the show

00:29:12.04 and that was the only thing they've heard from

00:29:14.09 it's just the worst you didn't realize I was angry because I was still making

00:29:17.08 jokes because that's how I deal with everything is is through you know anger

00:29:21.07 sadness uh whatever through comedy but so I was still making jokes

00:29:27.12 you were a furnace of rage and I didn't understand that and I kept throwing coal

00:29:33.06 in because I thought that we were doing a bit when we were no longer doing a bit

00:29:36.16 that was equally my fault you were throwing coal in and it was somehow

00:29:39.22 coming out as gold but like damaging the furnace as it was happening yeah it was

00:29:44.06 it was I I agree it was gold I feel like

00:29:46.15 I was very funny in all that [ __ I that got cut it's just unfortunately the

00:29:50.08 audience can't hear it but I was hilarious I was making myself laugh as I

00:29:54.19 was furious is it the type of thing that we could put out eventually like uh

00:29:58.13 maybe on his 100th birthday so no it was miserable I wanna we're not we're not

00:30:03.14 gonna glorify you I say we do a vinyl release on the 100th birthday of don

00:30:09.07 zimmer a vinyl of the most uncomfortable

00:30:12.06 not at all fun in eight years Eric what you want us nine years yeah what do you

00:30:17.23 want to stop this podcast earlier than that Eric what what year

00:30:21.21 so what we're doing the vinyl in eight years

00:30:24.09 well I think it's nine years because zim is only 91.

00:30:27.09 Okay nine years one of us one of us will be

00:30:31.01 dead also apparently by the time this releases one of us will be gone

00:30:34.23 but we will get the vinyl a year later yeah I mean we don't need three of us to

00:30:39.16 put out a vinyl well that's a good question so

00:30:42.09 I always assumed that when one of us dies we'll stop the podcast

00:30:46.15 because I wouldn't want to continue without all of us but

00:30:51.05 will we still continue to to release posthumous merch

00:30:55.07 like if one of us dies three years from now do we just show up back on the scene

00:31:00.08 in nine years can you please save could you put all of

00:31:03.21 the edited out audio in its own folder and will release like posthumous albums.

00:31:09.02 [Laughter]

00:31:10.08 None of it makes sense it's just all bad it's just all terrible uncomfortable

00:31:17.14 the pauses we could call it the sound of sounds I think it really annoys audio

00:31:22.15 files if you say a vinyl I think that's the incorrect

00:31:25.09 terminology isn't it put out a record put it out on vinyl what's the correct I

00:31:30.10 don't know what I'm saying I don't know what I'm

00:31:32.12 you can't buy vinyls right you buy records or you buy stuff on vinyl David

00:31:37.05 has never wished that he didn't speak more I wish I'd noticed

00:31:41.11 yeah you tell us expert you're the one with all the records got a fair few you

00:31:46.15 got you got you got three of everything right I don't know how you roll

00:31:50.19 got three insides.

00:33:21.11 phone I wish we had solutions like ship station back in 2003 when we started

00:33:26.08 rooster teeth and we were selling DVDs and t-shirts out of my spare bedroom and

00:33:29.20 we were loading up the back of bernie's truck and driving around to filling up

00:33:33.18 mailboxes all over town uh because we didn't the technology didn't exist yet

00:33:37.20 if we'd a had a ship station honestly if we'd had ship station back

00:33:41.00 then who knows how much more successful roof teeth could have could be today

00:33:44.14 well we'll never know unfortunately uh but luckily you won't be forced to make

00:33:48.21 the same uh inefficient mistakes that we did because you have ship station

00:34:34.20 online therapy we talk about better help a lot on this show and this month we are

00:34:40.00 discussing some of the stigmas around mental health I'm gen x and uh I know

00:34:44.19 from my generation a lot of people think therapy

00:34:47.06 I'm gen x so uh maybe a little older than the target uh demographic of this

00:34:52.19 podcast but I know that most people of my generation uh

00:34:55.23 were raised thinking that therapy was for so-called crazy people but that's

00:35:00.00 not true therapy doesn't mean there's anything wrong with you it means that

00:35:03.01 you recognize that all humans have emotions and that we need to learn to

00:35:06.21 control them not avoid them which uh was not something that was taught to us

00:35:11.01 widely back when I was younger and we've

00:35:13.00 been taught that mental health shouldn't be a part of normal life but that's

00:35:17.03 wrong too we take care of our bodies with the gym the doctor and nutrition we

00:35:22.13 should be focusing on our minds just as much

00:35:25.20 I've been in therapy now uh off and on for most of my adult life but for a

00:35:31.05 solid clip the last uh five or six years

00:35:34.04 uh though and it has uh it has helped me

00:35:36.17 transform myself it's helped me overcome a lot of limitations that I've had uh

00:35:40.13 help me understand myself a little bit better understand some of my impulses

00:35:45.05 and urges uh know when to spot uh the beginnings

00:35:48.17 of unhealthy behavior patterns for me and uh and be cognizant of that and be

00:35:54.06 able to do something about it in the moment it is it is actually it's it's

00:35:58.12 revolutionized my mental health uh and and I can say that with a hundred

00:36:03.22 percent uh honesty better help is customized online therapy that offers

00:37:08.05 didn't I was scared to reply to it I was like this is some sort of setup I'm I

00:37:13.19 can only mess this up I just ignored it well people understand why

00:37:18.12 in the future okay I texted you jingle jingle jing because I was doing

00:37:21.20 something and it related to the thing I was doing and I expected you

00:37:26.17 to reply but then you didn't and the longer you didn't the more weird the

00:37:31.12 text felt I honestly I read the text and

00:37:34.06 usually I I I'm usually excited to see a text review it's like there are certain

00:37:37.18 people in my context where if I get a text I'm excited Geoff and Andrew both on

00:37:41.20 those lists you sent me jingle jingle jingle and I was filled with dread I was

00:37:50.06 getting played somehow I'm gonna respond to this wrong I just couldn't deal with

00:37:53.11 it I just had to stare at it and be like oh no without any yeah I understand if

00:37:58.08 you would have replied it any way of it would have immediately explained out of

00:38:03.03 panic anxiety of I don't think what if he doesn't know what this is

00:38:23.23 okay well well how far away how far away is this is the solve to this mystery

00:38:29.07 let's say two episodes from now well oh my god all right well Gavin we have

00:38:34.08 ourselves a mystery okay let's put on our sleuthing hats

00:38:38.08 and uh and get our magnifying glasses Gavin should be able to solve this

00:38:42.23 and let's all let's figure out what could Andrew possibly be talking about hmm

00:38:48.06 what was the context around what was the last conversation you had with them

00:38:54.02 before before the jingle jingle jingle it could be a story about three santas

00:38:58.12 as they go around hacking various fast food restaurants I mean it could be

00:39:03.06 I guess it could be is there any I what have you guys been doing together

00:39:07.12 playing a lot of halo right is it is could there be playing halo any sort of

00:39:11.11 a halo connection there uh hmm did you did you lose your keys recently no

00:39:20.10 hmm no I had a door handle that almost exploded but I don't think Andrew knows

00:39:25.21 about wait what what uh yeah the door handle go bad yeah let's

00:39:31.01 stop down let's take a break from the mystery and well first of all what did

00:39:35.22 the bread clip say on it when did it expire that joke landed

00:39:41.11 that was a great joke let's talk about how well that went that was a [ __ ]

00:39:46.07 holy [ __ ] to that bomb everybody's dead that's just [ __ ]

00:39:51.05 Horrendous don't edit out that silence nick just leave that in oh my god

00:39:59.07 devastating I was excited about that one

00:40:02.10 too I thought that was good why were you

00:40:04.10 excited about that I I was probably just like hey we're trying it into the bread

00:40:07.23 club I thought let's get let's get a full mental process on that I mean I

00:40:11.14 thought you were I like the throwback yeah I thought it was a good throwback

00:40:15.04 bread clips have been talked about recently I thought it was a good

00:40:18.07 throwback I was excited about it and there was a nothing let's well let's

00:40:22.05 you know let's not assume something Gavin did a bread clip have anything to

00:40:26.19 do with your door handle exploding no and I don't

00:40:30.06 know not as far as I'm aware hmm well that's too bad

00:40:34.08 I I will say I'm trying to help you out there

00:40:37.11 sorry excellent recovery because your reaction to your joke was

00:40:40.20 I thought hilarious oh for sure oh it was well there's nothing it was just I

00:40:46.06 thought you could have told me that I dropped from the call it was so silent

00:40:51.20 it was as if I had downloaded the law again the level of just not being able to

00:40:56.08 but I hadn't so I had to live with it but I want to know about your door knob

00:41:00.10 exploding um anything to put him further away from that dream let's just keep

00:41:05.09 driving away from the bomb site just keep going I'm a I'm a big handle guy

00:41:10.19 uh not a knob guy when it comes to doors and I have a major issue with my cat uh

00:41:17.05 getting into the bedroom at night you know we can attempt to lock the door

00:41:21.02 from the inside but he just [ __ ] the handle over and over and over again and

00:41:25.16 eventually he gets in because he can open the doors so I thought we need a

00:41:30.11 handle that only humans can use so I got a fingerprint scanning handle um

00:41:37.11 Eric says that's a knob I don't want the knob Eric I don't like the feels of the

00:41:42.03 knob it is a knife what do you mean how much of your life do you spend with

00:41:47.07 a knob in your hand man it's like less than two seconds to me there's so much

00:41:52.01 satisfaction lost in a doorknob that you d you just lose all of the satisfaction

00:41:58.00 from the handle am I am I alone on this yeah

00:42:03.01 the action with turning a knob and the action of turning a handle are the same

00:42:07.06 it's just your hand is in a slightly different position there's just a more

00:42:11.11 positive feel feedback there's like a nice haptic feedback from a handle

00:42:17.09 that I think a knob is lost on you a knob

00:42:20.04 you don't always know when you're at the end of the knob reach and then

00:42:24.01 eventually your hand has to slide where the knob stops and I hate I don't like

00:42:29.11 that feeling the handle ends you know hand or paw has a hard stop on it but

00:42:35.01 your hand doesn't keep going anyway I got cheap piece of [ __ ] 35

00:42:40.11 fingerprint reading doorknob and uh that was my first mistake I probably should

00:42:45.01 have gone for one that was more expensive and I don't want to use

00:42:49.15 the fingerprint part of it I just want it to you know read any fingerprint

00:42:53.12 because I don't think smee knows about the

00:42:56.15 fingerprint part I don't think he knows to sort of touch his

00:43:00.05 little beans against the fingerprint reader so he just hits the handle and it

00:43:05.14 doesn't go because he hasn't touched the capacitive part and uh it it took four

00:43:11.00 aaa batteries and I think when when I was installing it I may have sort

00:43:16.02 of kinked a wire or done something when I was putting the cover back on to the

00:43:20.08 point where I was testing out the handles like oh this seems to work

00:43:23.16 pretty well smee can't open it I can open it anyone can open it that's great

00:43:28.12 but then I started to smell something and then I realized on the inside of the

00:43:32.06 the room the handle was insanely hot to the point where it's like I couldn't

00:43:36.10 even touch it for more than three seconds I was like oh it's burning me

00:43:39.21 and then I saw the little cover start to bulge and I was getting really worried

00:43:44.02 because I'd already put away my screwdriver and stuff but I was freaking

00:43:47.16 out ended up running to my garage to get my tools because I thought

00:43:52.01 the door handle was gonna explode I made it I mean I made it back in time I got

00:43:55.07 the thing off it was like burning me it

00:43:57.22 was like [ __ ] was melting inside it was starting to stick I just flung the

00:44:01.09 batteries out because they'd all started to sort of angle outwards I think there

00:44:05.18 was some sort of piece of the board that was like a capacitor or something that

00:44:07.05 was about to pop or something like that but it was just really a continuation of

00:44:12.00 my bedroom problems that I don't think most people have you know with like the

00:44:16.21 exploding apple remote the ripped sheets the exploding door handle but I know a

00:44:21.14 little part of me thought I should have just waited to see if the

00:44:25.12 door handle exploded but I just didn't want to burn the room down because I'm

00:44:28.21 sort of still in that phase of I want to be careful in this room yeah because

00:44:32.11 [ __ ] keeps going wrong in it okay did you did you check the reviews to see if

00:44:36.17 anybody mentioned spontaneous combustion

00:44:39.14 uh I'll be honest it was a pretty poorly reviewed door handle

00:44:44.12 you can't we cannot like get um you cannot get away with the

00:44:47.18 statement you just made you're like I've been having bad luck in

00:44:51.03 that room doorknob almost exploded the exploding apple remote you broke the

00:44:54.17 apple remote you snapped that in half you decide you made that decision

00:44:58.16 they're not the same thing Andrew it's all my fault I can't be blaming anything

00:45:03.05 I decided to do all of these things well

00:45:05.01 maybe I mean the sheet was an accident I wasn't trying to break that but it was

00:45:08.09 all me doing it didn't you break your bed in a different way that you didn't

00:45:13.09 think you didn't mention on the show is that a thing did I make that up uh

00:45:18.21 are you are you thinking of you Andrew no I'm not thinking of me my bed is fine

00:45:22.23 I have a bed frame on my patio still but outside of that every everything's good

00:45:28.02 how did my bed break you might be right I don't know

00:45:31.02 I think you said that you it broke a second time or something else happened

00:45:35.03 to it but I guess I'm wrong I guess I made that up for some reason that's

00:45:38.10 something that you don't remember I don't remember jingle jingle I swear to

00:45:41.15 god if we're playing halo later and you're like hey

00:45:45.16 oh I just remember the bed thing I'm gonna kill you we will not

00:45:49.06 definitively we will not all be here in eight years you will be dead I just need

00:45:52.17 to stop messing with stuff I'm gonna text you at like 11 o'clock tonight and

00:45:56.13 go oh I just got the bread clip joke really funny [Laughter]

00:45:59.22 what's that what's up Eric oh yeah do you have a knob now honestly

00:46:03.18 I still think the exploding handle is better than the knob you're insane shut

00:46:09.07 up why are you serious shut up what are you talking about

00:46:13.20 you're out of your mind you're gonna burn your house down uh I mean your

00:46:17.14 triple a batteries are gonna burn your [ __ ] house down because you have a

00:46:20.19 camera he's he's certainly not using the battery part now right like it's just

00:46:25.14 you have a knob that doesn't have a thing you just have a knob I rearranged

00:46:29.11 I rearranged the wire and I packed in oh you're [ __ ] you're a [ __ ] lunatic

00:46:34.17 I think it was an era with one of the batteries oh you are

00:46:38.13 an insane person I packed in four new ones monitored it and I have

00:46:43.07 you know fingers crossed a relatively cool fingerprint doorknob handle [ __ ]

00:46:48.15 that works and I think I think I'm gonna keep it for now because I still think

00:46:53.18 that's better than a knob between Geoff's bikes and your doorknob batteries

00:46:58.17 are just a no-go for this show yeah can't enjoy batteries they will always

00:47:02.12 expect that dangerous they are dangerous I do

00:47:05.05 I don't know if we talked about it but I really appreciated Geoff that your your

00:47:10.02 bike essentially kept exploding every time you ride it and that you had

00:47:13.11 multiple times of like after the first time it exploded you didn't give up

00:47:16.19 you're like we'll give it another go I made another fix hopefully it won't

00:47:20.11 explode this time process of elimination you gotta try all the different uh

00:47:23.14 permutations until you fee until you narrow it down to what the real problem

00:47:27.02 is so is every single person in disagreement about the knobs before we

00:47:31.00 move on yes yeah yeah you're you're you're in the wrong here 100 okay so

00:47:35.18 what if you have no you've got stuff you've got something in both hands what

00:47:39.19 you need to use an elbow to open the door you're [ __ ] out of luck with the

00:47:43.17 knob dab not only are you wrong about this you are so wrong that it makes my

00:47:48.14 mcdonald's take look even more right because if you disagree with that being

00:47:52.05 hacked nick said he likes handles handles are great but I I don't I'm not

00:47:57.07 pat like I don't I've never considered nobody hates handles

00:48:00.22 this isn't an anti-handle thing yeah nobody's anti-handle here man I think it

00:48:05.05 was a pretty pro-handle podcast we're also just pro doorknob and pro common

00:48:09.11 sense hmm well I mean what would your solution be just go with a knob deal

00:48:13.12 with it yeah go with the knob is it weird if all of

00:48:17.05 my doors have handles and one's got a knob is that weird

00:48:20.09 yes that is weird do yeah I don't want to redo the whole house

00:48:24.07 right but also your house burning down because of one knob is also weird if you

00:48:29.00 think about it

00:48:32.12 we really should saw it coming after it nearly exploded the first time

00:48:37.09 so wait a minute so you installed this handle

00:48:40.21 recently before that it was a knob no no before that was a handle so your

00:48:45.19 whole house has been handled this whole time when you moved in was it all

00:48:49.01 handles or did you move in and go oh look at these [ __ ] knobs I'm not

00:48:54.04 about it let's get this fixed uh yeah it was handles to begin with

00:48:57.16 handles to begin with got a handle house that's interesting apart from a few

00:49:02.15 pocket doors yeah huh I wonder if cause you have a newer home

00:49:05.16 I wonder if knobs are on the way out I wonder if handles are or like the new

00:49:09.18 the new hotness that's an interesting question no I think it's because my

00:49:13.12 house is very pleased my house is very very old but it's all it's all knobs

00:49:16.23 it's knob city what about you Andrew I don't

00:49:20.02 I don't know if I've ever lived in a house that was knob centric

00:49:25.03 I'd say majority handle Eric says no handles are for office buildings knobs

00:49:29.19 are for homes I've always thought handles were default and knobs are for

00:49:34.15 like apartments hmm I'm not sure I'm trying to think about

00:49:38.10 it I feel like knobs are better suited for like other people entering a room

00:49:42.22 that's more like keys and knobs wasn't the whole basis for when we were selling

00:49:47.18 bat knobs didn't you want that to be a knob is

00:49:50.12 that the only time you've ever fought for a knob you've advocated for the knob

00:49:55.06 well a bat a bat with a door handle at the end would be a bit weird don't you

00:49:58.21 think well no I feel like you wanted it to be like a not like you wanted it to

00:50:02.19 be a cabinet knob essentially it was what you described that's the cabinets

00:50:06.18 the cabinets can be you don't have cabinets wait a second we can't go back

00:50:11.18 to this we cannot that that's in a different season we can't go back to the

00:50:15.16 knob conversation please we can't.

00:50:18.10 I don't know maybe we can I think if you're gonna do

00:50:22.19 this you gotta you gotta be a [ __ ]

00:50:25.08 man about it and you got to get rid of every knob in your house which means you

00:50:28.19 can't have a knob on any of your cabinetry in your bathroom your kitchen

00:50:32.09 anywhere you have to handle all of your kitchen counter or cabinets

00:50:36.05 the the [ __ ] under your sink that's all got to be handles if doorknobs were

00:50:40.19 like our bat knobs a little bit more ergonomic for the hand I'd I think I'd

00:50:45.18 be into it I just don't like grabbing a sphere it's not very satisfying to me

00:50:49.12 now I do like grabbing a sphere I find spheres to be incredibly like a sphere

00:50:53.06 is what you want to throw you want to put your hand around it feels good to

00:50:56.12 hold a baseball a sphere is great when held from underneath but you don't grab

00:51:01.16 a doorknob from the bottom I I can't follow that line of thinking I

00:51:06.12 don't even know what to say about that what if your doorknobs are baseballs

00:51:12.19 what about that would you be okay with the knob I'd be fine with that because

00:51:17.20 the grip would be excellent it's the slip at the end of the doorbell of oh

00:51:23.18 god I really do wish I'd never started talking yeah isn't it terrible

00:51:28.07 at least we're listening to you speaking is always a mistake um.

00:51:38.08 I'm having a bad talk day I got so excited I woke up and I saw that the the

00:51:43.18 company that made Garfield card too curious racing announced that three more

00:51:49.01 Garfield games will be coming out over the next few years this is the Italian

00:51:54.12 company this is I think they're french they're microwaves is their name and I

00:51:58.07 was so excited that I was like I need to I need to retweet this I need to quote

00:52:03.05 to eat this and so I first I just retweeted it by mistake without putting

00:52:07.20 anything there then I here I'll post it I'll post the discord so you can

00:52:12.16 read it Gavin then you can see what I did what I followed it up with I made I

00:52:17.03 made a quick adjustment I'm like no can't can't read that you can read

00:52:22.02 read what I wrote

00:52:27.09 beings my dynasty beings was my second attempt

00:52:33.09 and I felt like he replied to it you left and replied things I suck because

00:52:40.10 I felt like you can't retry three times so I'm now stuck with beings but I have

00:52:45.18 to much like my great bread clip joe that was today as well we're having a

00:52:51.07 bad words day oh that looks great Geoff just posted a

00:52:54.21 photo of a door that has two baseballs as the knob that looks awesome that's

00:53:00.12 gotta be we've gotta all three of us do our offices like that I'm yes

00:53:05.12 I support this oh looks like those are Atlanta braves

00:53:09.07 baseballs we need well okay we is it what version of zimmer it's cubs right

00:53:14.23 for what for the the like if we're getting baseballs I feel like they

00:53:19.10 obviously the boys of zimmer was cubs era yeah so we got to get zim assigned

00:53:24.23 balls no I'm saying we have to get cubs balls if they're [ __ ] braves like

00:53:30.13 uh face baseballs so because I gotta hit

00:53:34.05 them all we are that's true I can't wait for that it's gonna be I have a

00:53:39.16 I have a ken griffey jr ball I could use for my handle

00:53:42.14 yeah yeah why do you have that I just did a video with him and he

00:53:46.23 signed it oh that's nice he's a nice guy is he have you met ken griffey jr

00:53:51.14 I have never met him but they say uh oh he's just lovely they say that's so

00:53:55.09 exciting everything I've read is that he's just

00:53:57.14 like he's just a a delightful person but I don't know maybe I'm wrong Gavin

00:54:00.18 what'd you what was your experience working with ken garvey jr the man who

00:54:04.10 by the way to this day I think probably had the most natural swing in the

00:54:08.23 history of baseball just a beautiful swing I'm sure Gavin would agree

00:54:12.15 sweetest swinging baseball it's what you swing

00:54:20.10 ken griff where would the nickname go for a ken griffey jr I feel like it's

00:54:24.22 tough to have the like the nickname in the middle when you have three names or

00:54:29.06 when you have a junior on it do you know what his nickname was Gavin no I don't

00:54:33.13 know what was his name well he had two uh I remember him being referred to as

00:54:37.18 the kid a lot but they also called him junior because his dad ken griffey

00:54:41.23 senior also played baseball so his nickname was the kid or junior and

00:54:46.11 until injuries he was uh probably going to go down as one of the greatest

00:54:49.18 players of all time I mean I guess maybe he still has but yeah I mean having

00:54:54.21 never really seen a baseball game uh I didn't know

00:54:57.05 of his career but I knew the name did you ask him about the staple didn't ask

00:55:00.21 about the staple honestly I didn't really want to ask him about anything

00:55:04.03 that he'd done because I just didn't want to embarrass myself in front of him

00:55:07.10 yeah yeah sure I I feel like if I was Andrew I would have sent him an email

00:55:11.16 before he showed up saying I don't like your uh games of baseball no

00:55:15.17 just just so we're on the record I don't like the Seattle mariners and I never

00:55:19.17 have anyway it's nice to meet you but yeah it was nice he he was injured

00:55:23.22 actually when we uh I felt like he was in pain while we were filming with him

00:55:27.00 he'd hurt his foot it would describe most of his career unfortunately

00:55:31.18 he was a trooper and uh he he slams the balls and uh the

00:55:35.21 balls that he missed or he didn't go for dan caught and one of them broke his

00:55:40.12 finger so great dan partially holds ken griffey jr responsible for his broken

00:55:46.02 finger so tony hawk broke his wrist and king

00:55:50.12 oh man uh we're getting the the rap sign from Eric

00:55:55.01 um I do feel like though we should mention at this point uh that

00:55:59.18 I believe the tiki toilets are out they're out ooh

00:56:03.18 yes yesterday we should mention I think depending I think this I think this is

00:56:09.12 tomorrow for when you hear this it's very exciting

00:56:13.21 I can't speak today I'm rattled I've been what are you yesterday they came

00:56:18.18 out that they came out on the 1st of February but it's not that day for us I've

00:56:23.21 noticed that there's there's six people on this discord we have um we have nick

00:56:29.09 Eric and kat what if the three of us just sub out and they can do the next

00:56:34.04 one I don't think that's part of cat's internship plan to take over an

00:56:37.14 established podcast I don't think it could be that much

00:56:41.08 worse than the three of us trying to talk again the bar is left

00:56:45.16 I'm just glad that we don't hate each other by the end of this one

00:56:50.21 and I'm very excited let me let me properly not sell but talk about

00:56:55.18 the port a potty I bought.

00:57:00.02 I think you all right no not no I'm not I bought one a year ago on February 1st

00:57:07.20 it's a year they come out on the same on the anniversary of when I bought them

00:57:14.10 which is which is uh kind of cool that it's coming out on the anniversary

00:57:20.19 but also just goes to show you how difficult supply chain issues are right now

00:57:26.12 we tried to buy that much like the much

00:57:30.08 like the [ __ ] stick which we bought and

00:57:33.02 ordered in a [ __ ] break show which is by the way no longer on order we're

00:57:37.22 still working it out we've had suffered some some [ __ ] stick setbacks

00:57:42.04 uh it took a year it took a year for us to get these these port a-potty tiki

00:57:47.06 shoes lots of [ __ ]

00:57:49.13 there were quality control issues with the first couple suppliers and then the

00:57:56.06 supply chain and now a full year later we have pink port a potty

00:58:01.06 tiki mugs and I would certainly appreciate it if you

00:58:05.20 are in the market for a tiki mug I would certainly appreciate if you would buy
