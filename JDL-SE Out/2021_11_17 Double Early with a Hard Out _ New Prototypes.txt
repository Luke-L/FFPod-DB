00:00:31.12 [Applause]

00:00:36.08 Oh there's Gavin two minutes early that's weird wow look it's an early day

00:00:42.13 oh wait okay why didn't so we're starting this ten minutes early

00:00:47.14 because you have a heart out at four yeah why didn't you just show up early

00:00:52.12 because we're all here around that time anyway

00:00:56.05 you're now two minutes early to being on time which is 10 minutes early what's

00:01:00.05 the problem with that by the way you're double you'll double you're a dude who

00:01:03.12 refuses to show up early or late and you're double early today you're double

00:01:07.16 early today with a hard out I feel like it's responsible to be double early so

00:01:12.02 that we're not rushed there are so many goddamn rules to you showing up to

00:01:15.22 things it's a couple just show up just show up when you want to

00:01:19.14 five-minute window before or ten minutes after

00:01:22.12 that's exactly what I did what you told me that's a rule you just gave him

00:01:26.15 another rule no it's just like that's a general thing gavin's got sub categories

00:01:31.02 he's got if I'm if you just start out then you got to be early you just said

00:01:34.16 what's this [ __ I you're showing up whatever you want

00:01:37.20 to show up whenever you want you idiot there's a range is what I'm saying I

00:01:42.01 think we all kind of live in a soldier five minutes I was two minutes that was

00:01:45.14 within the range what do you want from me Andrew yeah but you go against the

00:01:49.14 range is my point you are not a ranged guy you are an odd time guy you've been

00:01:53.11 very vocal about this we've argued about this so I'm just saying it's kind of

00:01:57.06 wild that you're here early I already pre-warned about the earliest today I

00:02:01.00 said it about noon yeah but you're earlier than your pre-warning of early

00:02:06.06 you're before the early he is bringing up a point that everybody

00:02:10.12 acquiesced to your tyrannical demands to move the podcast up 10 minutes we all

00:02:16.08 relented because it's like it's Gavin what are you gonna do we're

00:02:19.23 used to it it's who he is so we all say yes and move it up uh as as we do

00:02:24.15 because we're team players and then on top of that you then showed up

00:02:29.10 earlier it's just very out of character for you I don't care personally by 10

00:02:34.17 minutes to be earlier and I look at discord and every single person is in

00:02:39.04 there already except me why would I wait when I've already got the that's what

00:02:43.13 I've been saying forever what do you mean we're talking in general things you

00:02:47.21 will wait you've said in the past you will wait outside of a thing before

00:02:52.21 entering there's no hard outs hard outs mean we

00:02:56.05 gotta we we might have to cut it short so being earlier than

00:03:01.12 than expected like surprise early is okay in your eyes but only if there's a

00:03:07.21 hard out in play if you if you said come over uh at seven and we

00:03:13.07 have to stop hanging out at eight and then you were like so feel

00:03:18.00 free to come over whenever I'd probably come over earlier than if you just said

00:03:22.17 come over come over seven and we'll hang out indefinitely holy [ __ ]

00:03:26.13 there's like a whole strategy to get Gavin to show up at a certain time

00:03:29.13 without saying a time you just need to like display it in a certain way but

00:03:33.03 here's the issue and here's why you can't be mad I'm never late

00:03:38.00 no you haven't you haven't that's also not true it's rare

00:03:41.19 it's rare it's very rare but you haven't I just I also think it's uh Eric says

00:03:47.10 that you do have subcategories and you think he agrees with Andrew I agree as

00:03:51.08 well but I just think it's weird that Andrew who I feel like and I'm not

00:03:54.22 trying to poke a bear here start a fight but I feel like Andrew is the king of

00:03:58.20 subcategories I just think it's it's an interesting kind of hypocrisy for Andrew

00:04:02.20 to call somebody else out on subcategories even though even though I

00:04:06.08 agree with them all sub categories and regulations totally agree with them I

00:04:12.00 feel like I am been very vocal and consistent in my any additional amount

00:04:15.21 of thought or effort is too much and I feel like that's on par with my

00:04:19.19 complaint of Gavin he has like rules of my when I show up to a thing does not

00:04:23.21 matter if there's a heart out or not I feel like it would have been easier for

00:04:27.15 me at this point to be less considerate and just not mention the hard out I just

00:04:32.10 pissed off exactly at four I'd be like oh god go buy like surely that would

00:04:36.09 have been less blow back and potentially made a crappier product especially if

00:04:40.19 Andrew was futzing around with technical issues like sometimes he does

00:04:44.12 what that was that last time that happened was like seven months ago okay

00:04:49.16 and if we're doing measurements Geoff I still feel is in the lead and a lot of

00:04:53.10 the time I was delayed with my futzing around it's because nick would tell me

00:04:57.20 the foots nick would [ __ I me before the recording and I'd be [ __ ]

00:05:02.08 Around because of nick you're the only one who's been fussed by nick I think I

00:05:07.09 have been I wonder why because I'm the only one

00:05:10.07 here early I'm the first one way hey hey first one here hey

00:05:14.10 you can say you're the first one here all day I don't know I really argue with

00:05:17.16 that you're not the only one here no that's true that's true that is actually

00:05:20.18 that's like completely you're right I misspoke what I was gonna say is that I

00:05:25.07 don't think you even needed to alert the

00:05:27.18 10-minute early thing Gavin we all would

00:05:29.14 have been here you could have just shown up he's right about that we were all

00:05:33.02 already guaranteed to be here also recording already yes there's literally

00:05:37.16 zero times where you have joined the show and we've had like prep ahead of

00:05:42.21 time there's that doesn't exist look I apologize I I should have uh

00:05:46.18 I'm not gonna I'm not gonna tell you guys anything

00:05:51.01 you know what's weird I don't I don't know what I want from

00:05:55.00 you because I don't want you to apologize I don't want the apology I

00:06:00.13 don't feel you need to apologize but I don't understand how you came here

00:06:06.02 two minutes early it's insane to me Eric and nick accept your apology Gavin

00:06:11.05 and just like that we're already five minutes into episode 76 blew all of the

00:06:16.10 early time arguing about how early it was and now we're starting at the normal

00:06:20.15 time the F**kFuckFacePodcast I can you believe it's been 77 weeks already my name is

00:06:25.23 Geoff Ramsey with my guys Gavin free and Andrew panton they don't like each other

00:06:31.20 it's okay I like him oh where were we I like how girls

00:06:34.17 quite a bit has it been 77 weeks are we counting that week where we didn't do

00:06:38.23 one well I guess like what 70 how many weeks

00:06:42.07 are we at 75 right because we're two ahead 78 weeks then says Eric so 76 like

00:06:47.15 how many weeks from the point in which we first recorded to now has it been

00:06:52.23 more or less well because we recorded the first one two and a half weeks early

00:06:57.09 right um sorry I said anything no I'm just we gotta figure this out that's a

00:07:01.15 great point you just you know I was thinking in the car on

00:07:05.14 the way over here about everything everything we have to talk about today

00:07:09.22 and uh I forgot that I didn't tell a series of

00:07:13.08 bicycle issues I had last time although we had so much else to discuss uh

00:07:17.06 obviously we got some everybody went out

00:07:20.10 and got some 100 dark chocolate so we're gonna do the chocolate thing

00:07:25.12 uh what else was there oh oh oh I just realized uh I'm about to embark

00:07:30.04 on a whole apple weekend and I didn't even tell you guys about it

00:07:34.16 oh yeah yeah exactly and this is my third apple weekend that I've had and I

00:07:37.21 realized that's not something that's ever come up or that we've discussed but

00:07:41.20 I have apple centric vacations and uh and it's never crossed my mind to talk

00:07:46.08 about it are you doing like scrump vember or something what's going on but

00:07:51.22 one thing I wanted I was thinking on the drive over here I had to uh I was at

00:07:57.12 over at the day job we had a lunch with some guests in from out of town and we

00:08:01.12 were you know doing the wine and dine just everybody having a lunch getting to

00:08:04.21 know each other with the talent and it was a lot of fun and I was kind of sad I

00:08:06.08 had to leave early and then in the car I was driving over here I was like oh I'm

00:08:10.06 not sad because I get to record this episode and I realized how excited I was

00:08:15.05 to record this episode and then I got to thinking

00:08:17.12 do you ever I mean I know we know I know intellectually we know what we've done

00:08:22.23 what we've accomplished here but do you ever take a step back and think

00:08:27.03 how many obstacles to success we put in front of ourselves with this podcast and

00:08:32.08 still managed to survive and and dare I say

00:08:35.16 thrive I'm pretty proud of all of us like we named a podcast face

00:08:42.00 you can't sell it it's unsearchable we shot ourselves in the foot from day

00:08:48.23 one everything we did for this podcast was to the detriment of

00:08:54.08 the success of this podcast yet somehow 77 or 75 or 78 nobody seems to know the

00:09:02.04 math weeks later here we are I'm still driving across town like giddy that I

00:09:08.00 get to come and sit in front of a microphone and record with you guys like

00:09:12.19 because it's the highlight of my week maybe even right now the highlight of my

00:09:16.12 life and it's it's stupid that we're even in the

00:09:20.00 place that we are how did how did I mean thank god for the comment leavers right

00:09:24.15 for supporting us oh absolutely well nick race is a good point too

00:09:29.03 if you hashtag face uh the hashtag ends at the asterisk so it's

00:09:32.14 just everything you do is hashtag f so we can't even tag our own stuff either

00:09:36.21 like not even yeah it's the fact that it's unsearchable it's unhashtagable as

00:09:42.10 well we had to convince rooster teeth hey we want to make this show we want to

00:09:47.04 call it something offensive the like uh maybe the second most defensive word on

00:09:51.10 earth probably and uh and then we want you to we want you to go to advertisers

00:09:56.04 and tell them to give us money and then we want to name it something that's

00:09:59.19 impossible to search for it's impossible to find you got to be a goddamn

00:10:03.16 scientist to to to connect the dots to find our podcast on anything and it's

00:10:09.03 like yet here we are so I just want to say congratulations to everybody

00:10:12.17 involved in in place that's I'm super happy and proud about that that's very

00:10:16.02 cool though I'm not sure how much we deserve it but

00:10:19.16 it's definitely still the highlight of my week too

00:10:22.12 it's like strangely therapeutic and how much I miss it like when it we're in a

00:10:26.19 routine of it it's just like oh yeah this is the highlight of my week when we

00:10:31.01 take an off week it is like a noticeable gap in my week that week it sucks

00:10:35.08 it's like I have to put my life on hold and I can't talk about stuff right I

00:10:40.04 [ __ ] hate it I [ __ ] hate it and then you gotta queue up your life so

00:10:44.20 that you can remember to like it sucks really does it's also nick brings

00:10:49.02 up a good point it's also stupid we bleep the [ __ ] name unnecessarily

00:10:54.00 every time we say it to make it even harder so now people

00:10:57.00 don't do do they do we search for f star

00:10:58.18 star do we start for [ __ ] do we search for f bleep I don't know I don't even

00:11:02.21 know I feel like we we're always talking about the comment levers but what do we

00:11:07.20 refer to the people who don't leave comments but still listen because surely

00:11:12.21 it's just as important I think it's all just comment leavers I think Eric said

00:11:18.10 what what if we ever said listeners I think I

00:11:22.14 think it's either I I'm okay with Andrew

00:11:24.15 saying comment leavers like that kind of encompasses everybody I know that we

00:11:28.00 talked about uh calling them the Ians or the [ __ ] uh but I think comment

00:11:32.17 levers or if you wanna because I know we like

00:11:35.23 to sub categorize here because we like everything to be regulation we could

00:11:39.22 call them zimzoners I've heard a lot of zimmers a lot of zim stuff uh

00:11:43.20 what if we call them comment unleavers what does that mean we got comment

00:11:47.14 leavers and then comment unleavers people who leave comments and people don't

00:11:52.00 yeah it sounds like they're removing comments no they're just unleaving

00:11:56.09 comments they're just not leaving them dude I mean we call them the comment no

00:12:01.11 leavers do you want to call them that no comment comment no unleavers comment

00:12:05.20 on lures no comment leader I don't care.

00:12:12.06 Eric's Eric seems mad Eric uh why don't you chime in I don't why

00:12:17.01 comment lever seems fine as an encompassing thing and I understand that

00:12:21.17 everything for some reason in the show is subcategories for whatever reason

00:12:25.12 that is just why would you not just call them listeners why does it have to be

00:12:30.17 why did it have to be another thing because now we have comment on the big

00:12:36.15 idea is comment unleavers yeah they don't leave comments they're like

00:12:40.15 they're like the un leaver one who doesn't leave although I

00:12:44.00 do like the idea of everyone being called comment leavers whether they've

00:12:47.08 left a comment or not it's like long time comment leave a first time comment.

00:12:54.21 I uh I just went in to the very first invite I got for recording this podcast

00:13:00.08 76 weeks is where we're at okay okay 76

00:13:04.02 weeks clear answer but this is 78

00:13:30.02 have uh we're doing a special thing next week where we're all gonna eat apples

00:13:33.11 together I'm very excited about that we have the cosmic crisp launch coming I

00:13:37.22 meant to ask about that I know that was put on the schedule I wasn't listening

00:13:42.01 when that conversation happened uh what what is that what are we doing I like

00:13:46.13 your favorite part of the week you can't

00:13:48.12 bring yourself to listen the entire time no no no it was the po it was after it

00:13:53.20 was after the episode it was after I ate the chocolate and I was just I was like

00:13:57.22 completely zoned out and I thought we were yeah I thought we were talking about

00:14:02.10 when we'd record the next episode I did not realize that this is an apple event

00:14:06.09 of some kind we're eating yeah we're going to get we're all going to get the

00:14:09.07 apple the cosmic crisp so we're going to eat cosmic crips together crisps

00:14:12.20 together and then uh review them it's an apple okay okay it's an apple event and

00:14:17.22 it's on it's okay I'll look at the calendar it's on

00:14:20.14 the calendar I don't know yeah we all we all agree it's not an episode it's

00:14:24.17 specifically we're gonna eat apples to talk about it like what is this

00:14:29.01 we're gonna review the cosmic crisp we've been we're talking about for

00:14:32.23 months I'm just now that it's finally out I'm just asking just asking okay

00:14:38.21 I'm ready for the apple event so can you do it on that day or not

00:14:44.05 what day was it oh my god it was the day you agreed to

00:14:48.02 what do you care what you're doing on that day you're waiting for the time

00:14:53.09 what does it matter no no I'll be yeah I'll be there well I

00:14:56.11 don't know when but I'll be there does that mean I don't know when it is but

00:15:00.14 I'll be there strict requirements about what he'll show up for no I want to show

00:15:05.08 up for it I just didn't know it was its own thing I thought we were scheduling

00:15:10.17 the next November 9th from 1 to 2pm central time cosmic crisp apple event

00:15:15.22 now how many weeks ago it's 11 a.m that's 11 a.m your time next Tuesday yeah

00:15:20.19 oh yeah okay I remember that now I remember that part 11 yeah got it

00:15:24.23 I'm excited to eat an apple I'm excited to eat a cosmic Christmas even I

00:15:29.02 am concerned about your apple thing because I feel as though I am strongly

00:15:33.02 the apple guy of this podcast but if you're taking vacations based around

00:15:37.15 scrumping it sounds like I don't know if I can hold that title I didn't say it

00:15:42.23 had anything to do with scrumping but I'm glad you mentioned

00:15:45.21 apple centric but scrumping implies stealing apples I'm not stealing

00:15:49.15 anything uh I will say though uh this brings up another excellent point I'm

00:15:53.01 pretty sure last episode we were talking about all

00:15:56.00 the [ __ ] merchandise that we may or may not be making that nobody can

00:15:59.14 remember when it's coming out in all of that conversation I think we

00:16:03.00 forgot the [ __ ] scrumping sign is is coming out or is already out at this

00:16:08.04 point when this area be long comes out tomorrow I think to buy so

00:16:12.19 this will be all what is like November third or something

00:16:17.09 fourth uh today is November September 5th November 5th

00:16:20.07 what is going on today is the fourth it comes out on the fifth where did the

00:16:24.02 seventh time why does it [ __ ] matter to the people listening I don't know but

00:16:28.00 they're talking about it I'm constantly confused when people sat in front of a

00:16:31.21 computer don't know the date or time when it's right in front of them.

00:16:38.19 [Laughter]

00:16:40.17 Anyway I hope you bought a scrumping sign and they're not already sold out uh

00:16:45.18 if they are we'll order more and if they're not buy a [ __ ] scrumping sign

00:16:52.02 so they sell out and we have to buy more did we ever get more hats

00:16:56.01 like I feel like we I'd the hats people like the hats Russian [ __ ] hats yeah I

00:17:00.19 feel like they just went away like we never got more it's a great question

00:17:03.22 they're probably hanging out with all the jet ski gear and the uh

00:17:08.00 I like to imagine it was just in a shipping container that fell off a boat

00:17:13.03 it's just like in some beach somewhere

00:17:15.22 [ __ ] floats to some island somebody opens it up he's like why do I have 2

00:17:20.22 000 orange ping pong balls let's say 19

00:17:23.05 on them in like four years we're gonna learn about the jet ski army like the

00:17:27.22 Tupac army where they just stole all the Tupac shirts and also it's gonna be a

00:17:31.18 bunch of people in jet ski and uh [ __ I the pat merch it's gonna be a great

00:17:36.19 army the Russian [ __ ] army yes [Applause]

00:21:34.08 all right uh apple event so well first off what's going on with y'all hell oh

00:21:39.14 my god can we talk about something before we get into apple event sure.

00:21:47.03 I [ __ ] I sat down to eat my today is uh we're recording a podcast today so

00:21:53.08 obviously I eat my pre-podcast pastrami uh went to a restaurant ordered a

00:21:58.15 pastrami sandwich by the way guys there's such thing as a bad pastrami

00:22:02.12 sandwich and I am sad to say I had it today I don't want to call the

00:22:05.12 restaurant out but uh it was a local Austin restaurant and their pastrami

00:22:09.13 sandwich was dog [ __ ] was it the quality

00:22:12.21 of the pastrami was it what they added to the sandwich I was the flavor of the

00:22:18.02 pastrami the bread wasn't great the whole

00:22:21.07 the whole thing just it just didn't it wasn't like all the pastrami that I've

00:22:25.04 had thus far has been thin sliced and so it just like layered on top of each

00:22:29.05 other this was like thick almost like brisket it was just like it was wrong in

00:22:33.12 a lot of ways and it really it really bummed me out because I I didn't know

00:22:37.12 that you could have bad pastrami but also I got me thinking like if this was

00:22:40.14 my first pastrami experience it'd probably be my last so I'm really glad

00:22:43.19 that I got a good pastrami sandwich when I did uh but I was sharing this over

00:22:47.22 text and Gavin you mentioned that you also had a pastrami sandwich today and

00:22:51.11 then you've been perfecting pastrami sandwiches at your home and I am blown

00:22:55.18 away by this I want to hear everything there is to know about it you said you

00:22:58.17 became a pastrami guy so I was like let me get involved I'll order some on my

00:23:01.18 next grocery order and I've been trying to

00:23:05.06 sculpt the ultimate pastrami sandwich just by adding different stuff every day

00:23:09.00 maybe removing stuff you know trying it with mayo trying it with pepper just

00:23:12.17 sort of changing one variable at the time before I finally I've been doing it

00:23:16.03 for about two weeks and I think I'm closing the ultimate sandwich do you

00:23:19.17 want to hold off on what the ultimate sandwich is till you get it yeah like

00:23:23.12 hammer yeah okay red onion tomorrow I'm gonna see what

00:23:27.01 that does to it and I can I'll tell you what I think the current perfect

00:23:31.18 pastrami sandwich is after that let's see if they're very see if they're

00:23:35.01 similar Andrew do you wanna are you interested

00:23:37.10 at all in pastrami and would you be interested in also joining the quest for

00:23:41.08 the ultimate pastrami I'm very interested in joining it I don't think

00:23:44.17 I've ever tried pastrami that's where I was yeah I don't think I've had it is it

00:23:49.18 like a readily available can I get pastrami anywhere I would think so okay

00:23:54.05 I think it is very similar to brisket it is it's just prepared differently

00:23:57.21 it's also very similar to corned beef like corned beef is the same thing but

00:24:01.14 it's boiled whereas uh pastrami's cooked more like a brisket is yeah I don't

00:24:06.21 think I could even recognize pastrami in a lineup

00:24:10.12 look at it I was dramatic I was I was just like you until very recently

00:24:14.03 and I think a lot of I think a lot of people are Andrew and that's why part of

00:24:17.23 why I want to bring pastrami to the masses I want to raise the global

00:24:22.06 consciousness about pastrami because I feel like a lot

00:24:25.16 of people are missing it we're missing out on it myself you a lot of a lot of

00:24:31.05 people is pastrami is this a deli meat would this be

00:24:34.06 considered like a a general deli meat I mean it's like with the cold cuts and

00:24:38.17 stuff in it sometimes definitely a Jewish deli meat I'm not uh

00:24:42.03 I mean I would say I would say it's a pretty I'd say pretty prevalent yeah

00:24:46.05 okay and I was just like trying to put in my head of like if there was like you

00:24:49.18 know like the police line up and they had all the deli meats walk out I

00:24:53.12 definitely couldn't have identified pastrami by size

00:24:56.14 by sight yeah I'd have no idea telling what the pastrami was I wonder if you

00:25:00.13 could do it by smell ooh I don't know if I've smelled a

00:25:03.13 pastrami I guess we'll find out that brings up a question I actually uh I I

00:25:08.12 came up with uh the other day actually today when I was buying all the

00:25:12.21 chocolates do you think if we if we did a blind taste test and I put a a bar of

00:25:19.11 like a little nugget of 7075808590

00:25:19.11 and 100 you could get close to correctly

00:25:22.11 identifying them and putting them in the right order you're not talking about

00:25:26.04 pastrami anymore I'm talking about chocolate okay

00:25:32.08 what percent pastrami is this did you say chocolate or did I just miss

00:25:37.18 no he said chocolate he definitely did I must have missed the word chocolate

00:25:43.01 and it all fell into place when I heard the percentages but I was like

00:25:46.22 slightly confused pretty soon I'm pretty sure I said

00:25:49.14 chocolate but yeah it'd be interesting to have bites of each and try and uh

00:25:53.18 rank them yeah like could you tell the difference between 99

00:25:58.02 90 and 100 with your eyes closed I wonder I mean not yet

00:26:02.13 I there's a 99 I'd love to know if you could tell 99 to 100 right I mean I

00:26:07.18 could I could right now I can probably rank them by

00:26:10.23 how much I hate them and that would probably get them into pretty much the

00:26:14.02 correct order I haven't actually had anything between 70 and 100.

00:26:20.23 I'm excited for this chocolate thing I would advise if you I don't know Gavin

00:26:26.01 are you going to try any are you done if you fully are you out cause it sounds

00:26:29.17 like everybody else I already opted out okay so you're just gonna listen you're

00:26:33.06 gonna be the person giving commentary while we're all suffering what I wanted

00:26:36.12 to do what I said last week is that I wanted to

00:26:38.12 actually develop my palette first and slowly work my way up and then and then

00:26:42.01 potentially do it when I'm when I'm at 100. I would recommend you start

00:26:45.21 breaking up the pieces Geoff okay I'll open it up and start breaking the pieces

00:26:49.00 are we doing this now no no no no I'm just saying like when we

00:26:52.13 get there you're going to want to be prepared because we're having

00:26:55.18 a chocolate off right isn't that what we agreed to yeah well I think that you've

00:27:00.11 set you've set a world record at 9

00:27:02.18 minutes and 30 seconds exactly and I think we're going to see if you or I or

00:27:06.22 nick or anybody else can beat that time I think I can definitely beat it a

00:27:10.13 second time I've I this time I broke it up I put some thought into it I have a

00:27:14.23 strategy I think I could get it so much like chef

00:27:18.06 you could do yours on camera I don't really like chocolate oh that much uh

00:27:23.16 like I don't like dark chocolate at all I'm ambivalent towards milk chocolate

00:27:29.09 why would I do it on camera but official I could you did [Laughter]

00:27:38.08 yeah do you want me to do this on camera I mean what do you think Eric uh

00:27:43.20 yeah I think you should do it on camera if we have that option why not you know

00:27:47.17 all right be right back I mean then at least we can see his dog

00:27:52.04 wait why did he have to go that was the point is that he didn't have to

00:27:55.20 the point was that he didn't interrupt any of the show what the [ __ ] is going

00:28:00.06 on today what is happening this is a weird one I

00:28:03.16 didn't realize how much I messed up the podcast by moving it a mere 10 minutes

00:28:10.10 to the point where we wasted all of the new time complaining about what time it

00:28:15.12 started we still have we still have a hard out that hasn't changed now oh no

00:28:21.00 we're just up against the clock but Geoff had to go for a minute like what's

00:28:25.18 happening no I'm back are we doing our prototypes

00:28:29.17 before yes we have to we have to do whatever I forgot about the prototypes yes

00:28:34.18 you should do prototypes because we were hanging off the last episode on yes

00:28:39.00 dude thanks for mentioning that I completely forgot that they existed

00:28:42.19 really you're the why how we're doing this because of you what do you mean

00:28:47.14 well I appreciate this very sweet of you

00:28:49.12 to say I moved on uh I moved on to other stuff I guess I just forgot about it

00:28:54.16 I was thinking about chocolate and apples the uniform Geoff you can't forget the

00:29:00.06 uniform you will you don't you can't say it like that it's uniform uh

00:29:05.07 uniform uh combining the the fabric of the farm with the power of one uniform

00:29:10.11 yeah I feel like that changes every week yeah I think it goes backwards around

00:29:15.04 I can't I can't get this straight so how do we how do we want to do these

00:29:18.15 prototypes who wants to go first do we want to talk about the process that we

00:29:22.04 went into making them I'd like to see where you guys went because I think we

00:29:26.02 all have different things I wore my prototype during the entirety of last show

00:29:30.17 and we never mentioned it.

00:29:33.20 I like I lost my sunglasses and my keys in my prototype

00:29:45.11 so I have put I'm gonna be honest Geoff when you first originally pitched it I

00:29:50.13 wasn't so sure and it sounds like you're not either because you forgot that this

00:29:54.08 was a thing you've already moved on from the ice with so many brilliant ideas so

00:29:57.13 I've been thinking I thought a lot about it and I was like so what what is Geoff

00:30:01.16 wanting he wants the pockets to be gone you're really big on wrist technology it

00:30:06.23 needs to be a wrist thing and I was trying to think of different ways I

00:30:10.06 could do it I had a few things planned I think Geoff I discovered a thing about

00:30:14.12 you that you may not even know about yourself I feel like I went so deep into

00:30:17.20 your psyche that I'm gonna drop something on you and

00:30:21.14 you're gonna be like holy [ __ ] you're right I don't think

00:30:26.19 you're an anti-pocket guy Geoff as much as you are a velcro guy I think what

00:30:31.16 you're looking for is provided entirely via velcro

00:30:34.06 and it's a really it's like a basic we can just innovate we can I don't know

00:30:38.07 what the velcro market is like I went I used a basic product with a lot of flaws

00:30:42.04 and I think uniform could really advance this idea this is sort of like the base

00:30:47.12 idea the base concept was you just you get some velcro as the thing

00:30:52.17 and then you can expand to it you have the ability to really add whatever you

00:30:57.11 want to so like you're saying pockets are important like you need to be on the

00:31:00.21 go what you need to do like sometimes you

00:31:03.22 need a snack so you got your snack when you need it you got your wallet on your

00:31:07.03 side you don't need to worry about being pickpocketed because it's in sight at

00:31:11.01 all time you gotta cope you ever need to do the soda chug you're

00:31:14.12 ready like you're just prepared for your [ __ ] day and it doesn't even stop

00:31:18.04 there you got [ __ ] chocolate on the bottom half like you're just ready you

00:31:22.10 want a nice little snack you want to pick me up

00:31:24.12 you're good to go so what I think really the uniform we need to look into velcro

00:31:28.17 technology in advance on this because this is easy to do it looks what

00:31:33.06 else can you do with your hand while all that [ __ ] is taped to it oh literally

00:31:38.15 anything it's hands-free it's all so good it's this is so good

00:31:42.18 this is velcro on the go man you can velcro on the go this is so good

00:31:48.06 it's velgo yeah it's go crow

00:31:55.09 my favorite part is just that top picture without anything on it it looks

00:32:00.01 like your hand is choking yeah it was like too tight oh it was

00:32:04.02 very tight it was not because I was as nervous because I put that on like I

00:32:09.10 don't know 90 minutes before we recorded to like get things prepped it was a

00:32:13.07 whole process I wanted to give a hand to high michlinweaver before.

00:32:18.14 [Laughter]

00:32:22.00 Then I got everything on it was it was terrible

00:32:25.19 it's a terrifying process how'd it feel how to feel do you feel good

00:32:29.12 you know what Geoff to be completely honest with you it felt very insecure

00:32:34.13 which is why I think there's room for uniform to greatly improve

00:32:39.22 look these are jumping off points these are meant to create inspiration to

00:32:44.20 strike inspirations of the week and then go out and explore and I've seen a lot

00:32:48.01 of a lot of I don't know if you guys have been on the the subreddit and the

00:32:52.08 uh socials but the audience has come up with some amazing stuff like the w like

00:32:55.22 the rocket with a w that's really cool Andrew I think this is [ __ ] amazing

00:33:01.12 and this is exactly what I was talking about I didn't even consider velcro

00:33:06.00 brilliant disaster it looks like you'd go to check the time and an apple would

00:33:11.20 hit you in the face no you're just gonna sling stuff

00:33:15.20 don't no you okay well first of all I can't wait to [ __ ] see your prototype

00:33:21.12 second of all you're not checking the time on that hand that is clearly a coke

00:33:26.00 apple chocolate wallet hand that's not what you can man you can't even have a

00:33:30.05 watch anymore no that you don't put your

00:33:32.13 watch on that hand you put your watch on the other on the other hand you for you

00:33:38.08 the main functionality of the wrist is what do you mean

00:33:40.19 how many [ __ ] watches do you wear do you need a watch on both hands what are

00:33:45.05 you talking about I'm right-handed my watch goes on my left well then put it

00:33:50.12 on your [ __ ] right and put this on your left flip it it's velcro man it

00:33:54.14 doesn't care where it goes you can put it on your goddamn leg for all I care

00:34:00.21 you got choices you got multiple limbs Gavin

00:34:05.12 it's a coke cat on you you're gonna walk

00:34:08.07 by a radiator and ding it and it's gonna you don't have to put a coke can on it

00:34:14.06 you're probably whatever 2021 what radiator are you walking by where do you

00:34:19.01 live radiator what is this new york city in

00:34:22.23 the 1940s are you drying your socks what

00:34:25.17 the [ __ ] people still use radiators and new builds it's not old not in Texas

00:34:31.03 well not here no but if you use this product you would have

00:34:35.02 had your [ __ ] sonic drink Gavin it wouldn't have been in your yard

00:34:40.01 it would have been secure maybe if you to use this product you to hit yourself

00:34:44.08 in the head with the apple and knock some [ __ ] scents into you

00:34:48.08 I don't mean to be down on this product I think it's a really good product

00:34:52.16 that I was going to go somewhere else with that I'm just going to stop right

00:34:54.10 there.

00:34:58.00 I want to cause more arguments

00:35:02.13 Andrew I think it's great I love it I love everything it's a fantastic

00:35:08.00 starting point and I'm open to criticism just not any that Gavin is saying it's

00:35:12.15 ridiculous right terrible complaints okay so between

00:35:17.08 which subjects do you allow criticism well I think any valid criticism is fair

00:35:22.11 you're coming over here you're like what if a [ __ ] giant magnet comes by your

00:35:27.14 house like what are you talking about.

00:35:31.12 I'd like to see somebody try to scrump that [ __ ] apple is all I'm saying

00:35:37.00 good luck security excellent boy it's not an excellent point

00:35:46.02 it's so much more secure in your pocket no it's not no it's not it's gonna

00:35:51.04 [ __ ] you you're not nobody puts apples in their pockets.

00:35:57.09 I want to see you walk around awesome with an apple in your front pocket if I

00:36:01.19 was to make an apple unstealable I'd probably put it in my pocket I wouldn't

00:36:06.08 hang it off my wrist if I'm in a park and I see a guy pull an

00:36:11.03 apple from his pocket I'm leaving I'm terrified it's a psychotic move

00:36:16.13 just pull an apple from your swear to god if if you are ever anywhere

00:36:21.14 in a public setting and you see an adult human being pull an entire intact apple

00:36:26.17 out of their pocket and start to eat it turn around and go the other way quickly

00:36:31.00 that's not a good healthy person

00:36:34.21 all right Gavin that's the go pro the go pro I love it okay let's should I

00:36:40.21 do mine oh I can't I cannot wait for this why are you gonna no I'm excited

00:36:51.01 remember to keep uh all criticism regulation yeah regulation

00:36:55.18 yeah I will regulation criticism yeah okay so I've based it on

00:37:01.22 personally I feel like the pocket is absolutely fine if anything I want more

00:37:07.09 pockets so I really just summed it down to what

00:37:10.03 Geoff wants and what Geoff wants typically is the following it's a three-step

00:37:15.11 process is what I've nailed it down to number one

00:37:18.15 find a problem that doesn't exist number two

00:37:20.18 solve it in an inconvenient way and number three give it a name that's a

00:37:24.19 real stretch all right those are the three requirements that I've identified

00:37:29.20 so let me introduce to you the nice to treat you

00:37:32.23 in a in a covered world you don't always want to go for the handshake sometimes

00:37:37.17 you may want a fist bump or a high five the high five talk from the previous

00:37:41.11 week really got me intrigued about this idea

00:37:44.20 um so the nice to three to you uh gives you an option of three greetings.

00:37:54.21 I feel like I'm watching a hand give birth to a fist.

00:38:03.09 I don't know I should point out that um meg turney helped me make this because

00:38:09.05 there was some sewing report it looks like an alien facehugger shadow.

00:38:13.17 [Laughter]

00:38:17.16 It's theater next he's going to make a doberman pitcher that he's going to make

00:38:21.18 a butterfly

00:38:24.08 a biblically accurate angel.

00:38:33.18 [Laughter]

00:38:43.18 In many ways this was not the assignment

00:38:47.06 but in no also in many many ways this is

00:38:49.22 one of the greatest inventions I've ever seen

00:38:53.04 I think this is exactly what we're looking for at uniform uniform

00:38:57.08 combining the fabric of the farm with the power of one uniform sometimes also

00:39:00.12 referred to as uniform combining the power of one with the fabric of the farm

00:39:04.17 uniform I think that what you've done here

00:39:07.18 is brilliant and it's exactly the kind of visionary thinking we need here at

00:39:13.02 face industries which is an arm of uh as we all know

00:39:18.10 uniform uniform combining the power of one with the fabric of the form uniform

00:39:23.01 so I'm really proud of you and I have no criticism I appreciate that Geoff Andrew

00:39:28.13 any criticisms from you what does it feel like to like hit that like for a

00:39:33.09 high five like is it fluffy does it just flop like what is there is there any

00:39:38.19 any feedback you get a light slap sound but it's a little bit springy oh

00:39:43.21 what is this called again nice to threat you so yeah nice to three let me let me

00:39:49.16 write it down nice two street you how do you do it how do you tm [Music]

00:40:02.19 I'm gonna compliment gavin's invention you know if you are ever attacked by a

00:40:08.01 flock of birds the additional hands would be great like this is a great product

00:40:13.12 I've got nothing but compliments for this it's phenomenal in every way

00:40:20.10 oh my god dude oh so what about you Geoff yeah what do you

00:40:27.05 got Geoff oh well I I I for I really like

00:40:31.11 making commercials right you guys know I really like to do the graphics uh

00:40:36.17 I like to go above and beyond I didn't have time to do a graphic treatment this

00:40:39.23 time I took some photos I didn't think they were great so I just made a little

00:40:43.18 video it's about a minute long I'll go ahead and drop it in here what are the

00:40:47.03 odds that's too big too big for discord oh is it gonna be

00:40:50.01 too big for discord do we do this every time it's always too big for discord

00:40:53.08 that he puts into slack this is just I'm opening slack right let's see

00:40:58.08 uh it's too big okay so let me put it on slack like four times

00:41:05.16 well dude I can't even remember that we were doing this this week so why should

00:41:10.13 I remember the file side okay so uh for those listings Geoff has a bag on his

00:41:16.04 hat what Geoff did is he pocket he made a shittier fanny pack and

00:41:20.15 he attached it to his wrist what I did is I took an actual pocket from an

00:41:25.19 actual pair of pants and I cut it out so I have a pair of pants with no rear

00:41:29.03 pocket now I have to remember not to put stuff in that pocket which shouldn't be

00:41:32.12 an issue because I don't use real pockets anyway but it is a pair of pants

00:41:36.08 it's like still in it's still in rotation it was the only bargain I could find

00:41:41.22 why you're gonna put your pocket in those

00:41:45.05 one day it's gonna be something I just have to remember never to use that

00:41:49.22 pocket and then then what I did was I sharpied

00:41:54.02 wrist pockets rock on the side of it and then I duct taped it to my hand

00:41:59.06 and then I put all my stuff in it and it worked

00:42:02.15 the glasses got a little stuck what should you have to contort your entire body

00:42:09.18 well that's cause I'm trying to show off the glamour shots you know I want

00:42:13.11 everybody to see it from the best thing yeah.

00:42:18.15 [Laughter]

00:42:22.21 [Music]

00:42:27.11 I think we have two very viable products.

00:42:33.18 I'm feeling really good about this really really good Geoff's looks so

00:42:38.17 annoying I can't remember how annoying it must be to do anything other than

00:42:42.22 make that video have you did you try and

00:42:45.16 do anything else with that on your wrist uh like what like laundry no no no

00:42:51.03 nothing like that I love the idea of making a commercial for a product that

00:42:56.05 one of the steps is duct tape it to yourself with ease

00:43:00.10 well it's just it's it's tempting oh okay it's not this is not heavy duty

00:43:05.22 tape like I was anticipating do you know what I like about doing laundry

00:43:11.01 that I don't have to take all my pockets off yeah we have to empty them out

00:43:16.21 that's true you know what's faster than emptying

00:43:20.02 them out just take the pocket off just de-velcro it off your wrist

00:43:23.17 this doesn't replace your pockets though you still have pockets you just got

00:43:26.19 empty pockets I guess they're pre-emptied that's a good point yeah I

00:43:30.21 heard it about I'm working on cutting all my pockets out of my pants right now

00:43:36.19 I may not have a choice soon

00:43:40.04 it just hangs all over your fingers it's so annoying

00:43:44.04 oh it's the [ __ ] worst it's the worst what what would you feel confident in

00:43:50.13 putting in Geoff's wrist pocket Gavin like if let's say you're going out with

00:43:56.06 Gavin or Geoff you're with me you know what I'm immediately thinking like

00:44:01.16 snacks I I put you I don't trail mix in there or something

00:44:04.08 I don't trust it I don't trust the no I don't trust the security of it gum yeah

00:44:09.16 I think I trust gum if I'm it's like what are you okay losing is sort of the

00:44:13.07 question I'm asking you're not gonna the only way you're gonna lose it's because

00:44:16.13 you can't get it out of the pocket because it's too deep

00:44:18.22 well the bad thing with gum is that if you forget it's in your pocket and you

00:44:22.04 wash it you wreck all your clothes with this it's never gonna go in the laundry

00:44:25.22 that's great actually that's the ultimate gum storage that's brilliant

00:44:29.14 Gavin you know like movies where they're transporting something really valuable

00:44:33.02 and they have like it handcuffed to their wrists like the metal briefcase

00:44:37.05 imagine seeing somebody walk out with one of them it's like this

00:44:41.05 is how we're transporting this thing

00:44:43.22 it's like a gold bar sticking out of it [Laughter]

00:44:47.11 yeah I feel like it'd be good for loose stuff like loose little tiny things oh

00:44:53.17 it's gonna be loose I like that you went

00:44:56.05 for a pocket that was so much wider than your wrist too not one of those small

00:45:00.06 pockets that's the size of the pocket in my

00:45:03.13 pants man I don't know what to say oh I'm glad I dug deep and went with velcro

00:45:08.01 because I that was my first idea Geoff was I was gonna do the same thing but I

00:45:12.15 was gonna use shorts and not in rotation I would never use an in rotation pair

00:45:17.15 yeah yeah it's gonna be a fun little game of pocket roulette I'm gonna play

00:45:21.12 with myself going forward after all my criticisms of Andrew I didn't expect for

00:45:26.08 that one to be the most convenient [Laughter]

00:45:29.18 I love it because we got three unique and distinctive takes

00:45:34.11 three new products well two are very similar but

00:45:37.07 at least two new products that could go to market here very soon with

00:45:40.21 appropriate testing and uh who knows which one's gonna be a huge if not both

00:45:45.01 huge hit if um you're listening to this on the podcast app

00:45:49.05 what's the easiest place to see these Instagram

00:45:52.13 Instagram yeah actually you'll find the uh YouTube version yeah there's a

00:45:56.19 YouTube version yeah that's on that too like yeah I'd say interesting

00:46:01.07 these are some great some great creations

00:46:04.10 I am impressed by biology I'm proud of everybody yeah yeah I like these I think

00:46:09.16 we should maybe have a quarterly uniform brainstorm [Laughter]

00:46:14.08 well you know it's it's funny because we we hinted at it briefly we haven't

00:46:17.19 talked about it too much but we actually have a show going in pre-production

00:46:21.18 that's kind of uh adjacent to face but it's

00:46:25.08 sort of a uniform uniform uh combining the power of one with the fabric of the

00:46:30.00 farm uniform uh it's kind of a uniform-esque it's it's it's kind of in

00:46:33.14 the in this world and so uh comment levers I guess should keep their eyes

00:46:37.06 peeled because hopefully that'll be out at some point in the next couple months

00:46:41.19 that was a great segment that was a really thoroughly enjoyable yeah I just

00:46:47.07 kind of wanted to take a moment just a joke I'm so I have had I it has been so

00:46:52.04 professionally and personally rewarding creating products to make the world a

00:46:56.17 better place uh through through face like the beef

00:47:00.08 bracelet and the two spicy icy obviously now wrist pockets uh

00:47:04.14 and just like just just knowing that that you're helping humanity in some

00:47:08.08 small way uh and now that you guys are on board and

00:47:12.02 doing it with me it's like it's like a dream come true for me I'm excited do

00:47:16.15 you know what was admitted to me recently what minor league fan jack

00:47:21.00 has access to this discord and obviously he's a big fan

00:47:24.12 so sometimes he just scrolls through the

00:47:27.16 chat and tries to guess what the episode is about

00:47:30.07 I watched him do it today did you really yeah I saw him doing it today yeah

00:47:35.07 I think he'll be quite confused with this one

00:47:38.10 I like the ones that have no context to the actual show I cannot wait for him to

00:47:44.12 speculate on a Danny trejo conversation that never happens

00:47:47.18 that's gonna be great well now you gotta mention it oh I saw

00:47:51.12 those pictures of was that Danny trailer from far cry yeah I didn't know Danny

00:47:55.03 trejo was in far cry 6 and then I assumed that he was he makes tacos yeah

00:47:59.12 he's making tacos he's just like a giant ad read for his taco business or

00:48:03.14 promotion whatever and I didn't think you'd be able to kill him and you can

00:48:07.07 absolutely kill Danny trejo and I felt tremendous guilt about this so I just

00:48:11.16 kept him on my shoulder for like the next 40 minutes of playing that game I

00:48:14.22 was just everywhere I went I just had Danny trey out with I really love the

00:48:19.14 idea of playing that game where 50 of your screen is daddy trejo's back

00:48:23.20 that's taken up the entire left side I saw the images and I assumed it was

00:48:27.03 something like this and it got me thinking you should if you can carry him

00:48:30.14 with you like that you should just see how many scenic places you can like

00:48:35.01 share with Danny like just set him down

00:48:37.17 leaning against the wall on a beauty you know at the beach then take him to the

00:48:41.11 top of a building and then off to a mountain you know next to a fountain I

00:48:45.20 agree it feels like a things to do almost it does it feels like very true

00:48:50.00 we should do video game [ __ ] traveling

00:48:57.16 well now you've got to make that video no I guarantee you he would retweet that

00:49:02.19 too that's [ __ ] funny how early in the game can you get to trejo I didn't

00:49:08.00 find him until after the game oh but can you just go straight to him

00:49:13.10 if you know I think you might be able to it was a weird thing where I was

00:49:17.03 literally in the final act of the final mission like three minutes before

00:49:20.13 finishing and the character was like yeah you want to go hang out with Danny

00:49:24.06 trejo and I was like [ __ ] this mission yeah I do what do you mean Danny trey

00:49:27.09 was in this [ __ ] game let me just stop like the final arc of

00:49:30.06 this thing let's go do that but I couldn't I was locked in so I don't know

00:49:34.06 for me it wasn't until after it was over I found him about 10 hours in and I

00:49:38.02 think you could have gotten there way earlier I think he's in the

00:49:41.11 like when you leave the opening island and you pick your first like story I

00:49:45.04 think he's available from then yeah hell

00:49:47.18 yeah weird I don't know take him through the whole game [Laughter]

00:49:51.20 if only it like reflected in cut scenes what a great story that would be dude

00:49:56.13 that'd be phenomenal so should we do chocolate like we're

00:49:59.04 coming outside oh yeah so real quick before we do chocolate I was going to

00:50:02.07 say I'm uh so I'm going on an apple trip this weekend and I'll be talking to

00:50:05.18 y'all you're doing what I'm going on an apple

00:50:08.18 trip this weekend what does that mean I feel like we still don't know

00:50:12.21 every November this will be the third November in a row

00:50:17.20 uh we go up to Detroit to visit emily's sister uh and their family

00:50:22.01 and uh by the way big slow-mo guys fans their kids are big slow-mo guys fans

00:50:25.11 Gavin so oh congratulations give him something uh I think yeah sure

00:50:28.21 absolutely and you know and you know you know they're

00:50:33.01 you know Kent right yeah he's uh he's emily's sister's husband uh

00:50:36.13 anyway so uh so like a small world right anyway so we go visit them uh every

00:50:41.18 November for a weekend and every time we go there they take us to

00:50:47.20 a uh like an apple mill where they uh they make fresh hot apple cider and they

00:50:52.03 make fresh hot apple cinnamon donuts and they have all these apple related foods

00:50:57.04 and it's all very aptly and it's like the highlight of my year and a week

00:51:00.21 we're going this weekend just so that I can go back to the apple mill and then

00:51:04.04 it just struck me oh yeah I guess this is this is we do this apple [ __ ] and

00:51:08.10 face I never made the connection but I just booked my tickets like two days ago

00:51:11.20 to go up and get my have my apple weekend and uh maybe I'll get lucky and

00:51:15.08 there'll be cosmic crisps there but I doubt it because I'm sure it'll only be

00:51:18.13 apples grown locally to Detroit that's exciting but I'll take tons of

00:51:22.23 pictures I I feel like that puts you in apple guy territory of the podcast are

00:51:27.06 you worried Andrew it's less about the apple and more about the donuts for me

00:51:30.23 but yeah and the apple yeah I was gonna say like I think I believe Geoff you once

00:51:35.02 said that an apple is never above a six or a seven for you so yeah I would say

00:51:39.05 seven even though you're traveling for them I think I'm above as as uh there's

00:51:43.21 some nine or ten apples out there I'm more I'm more about going for the apple

00:51:48.12 experience like it's fall and it's beautiful and the leaves are you know

00:51:52.16 and it's like it's invariably it'll be because I've been to a few different

00:51:55.18 ones it's by like a little stream and there's like a big wheel spinning in the

00:52:00.04 stream and there's like families having picnics and it's just very

00:52:03.18 quintessential like fall america I'm more for that experience and it's less

00:52:07.08 about the apples and more what they do with them apple cider hot apple cider

00:52:11.04 mmm that shit's good I would rather like I'm way more excited about that than

00:52:14.14 just than eating a bog standard raw ass apple you know that's fair I want to eat

00:52:19.06 some chocolate is what I want I wanna eat some chocolate let's do it did you

00:52:22.06 ever eat the banana by the way Andrew after your chocolate it's funny you

00:52:25.18 mentioned that Gavin I was gonna bring it up after the fact guess who bought

00:52:30.20 some [ __ ] bananas yesterday nice I bought a whole set

00:52:35.01 because when I was set I bought it listen I had banana anxiety I realized

00:52:39.10 I've never bought a banana before I didn't know what to do I was very I was

00:52:43.00 like what is the protocol here there are

00:52:45.05 bags do I put the bananas in the bags do I need to know a code what do I need to

00:52:48.23 do I don't want to be embarrassed I don't want to look like a banana rookie

00:52:52.11 when I get to the counter I go to chat you don't know banana code I don't know

00:52:56.21 banana code Geoff I was very insecure about it until I saw another guy scroll

00:53:01.08 stroll by with his cart and he had bananas in it and I was like okay I'm

00:53:05.03 good I don't need to over think this nick has a good point what um what color

00:53:09.03 status have you got I went with yellow because uh I figured that's them in

00:53:13.11 their peak right

00:53:15.14 yeah they're still pretty good into brown as well but I think the greens are

00:53:20.21 the worst gotta wait when they get brown

00:53:22.23 that's when you make banana bread out of them so what happened after I ate the

00:53:27.18 chocolate yesterday I needed just something that wasn't dead in my mouth so I

00:53:32.04 started eating an apple one of the best apples I've ever had I can't tell if it

00:53:36.19 was just a great apple or if the chocolate made everything taste like

00:53:42.02 [ __ ] to the point where anything other than that was amazing like it was a

00:53:45.14 return to flavor yes so if I still think

00:53:48.13 the banana is dog [ __ ] after eating this

00:53:51.04 bar bananas stink they just suck there's like this is the best way if I'm not

00:53:55.21 gonna like a banana in this environment I will never like a banana what kind of

00:53:59.16 apple was it uh I don't wanna I can't say I'm once again I'm keeping my cards

00:54:03.08 to my chest I'm not gonna let you okay all over my favorite apples

00:54:07.22 okay all right sure that's right I don't

00:54:07.22 wanna [ __ ] on your apples but okay yeah

00:54:10.19 I promise you I don't want to [ __ ] on your apples the stuff we're private

00:54:15.12 about on this book you've said otherwise Geoff admitted

00:54:19.12 like that was a smart move I gave you that a granny smith is in the

00:54:23.23 top seven that's all I'm gonna give you I'm not telling you what apple that was

00:54:29.05 is it two or is it six could be seven all right so we're running out of time

00:54:35.00 uh because Gavin has his heart out I'm ready to go is everyone else

00:54:39.06 prepared for their chocolate the time is nine and a half minutes yeah I'll

00:54:43.13 start my stopwatch again does everyone so who's doing Geoff's doing this and

00:54:47.07 there's no I'm gonna do it nick nick is doing it I believe are you doing are you

00:54:51.20 doing on camera Geoff oh [ __ ] I gotta do it on camera okay uh how do I do that

00:54:56.04 after all that so wait why did you get up earlier and say I'll be right back

00:55:01.08 I was just getting a drink.

00:56:35.09 I'm holding it we got a goddamn heart out Geoff

00:56:40.10 what are you doing Geoff what are you doing this is why I gave the extra 10

00:56:45.09 minutes Geoffrey yeah but you also caused this by bringing up him filming it

00:56:50.15 you gave the 10 minutes to take it away hey can you hear me now yeah yeah we

00:56:56.08 yeah can you hear us uh yeah hold on that [ __ ] uh

00:57:17.11 that's what I'm doing oh boy oh I was all worried because I kind of

00:57:21.23 dropped my chocolate that I wouldn't get at my hands in time that was eight

00:57:25.15 minutes ago I know I know it's [ __ ]

00:57:27.18 sucked I don't know what happened just like as soon as I hit record I stopped

00:57:32.15 being able to hear you guys uh yes so testing

00:57:36.03 what uh-oh remember all the [ __ ] you gave me about my futson Gavin remember

00:57:40.14 the futs in conversation getting in this episode

00:57:44.00 fantastic testing check one two all right I'm ready to eat chocolate if you

00:57:47.12 guys are I am so ready to eat this I'm not recording this video by the way

00:57:52.02 not after that that's fine that's [ __ ] that's fine countdown uh are we ready

00:57:57.14 yes okay three two one chomp

00:58:05.07 now Gavin what we didn't anticipate is that this is just going to be people

00:58:09.10 with their mouths full of chocolate and somebody's got talk yeah I've got no one

00:58:13.06 to talk to yeah no it's just it's just going to have to be me and you because I

00:58:16.12 didn't I was thinking well it's not just going

00:58:18.21 to be Gavin and nick is eating the chocolate also but

00:58:26.17 all right so uh how many squares in do you think we are uh Andrew do you think

00:58:32.01 you're faster than last time

00:58:42.15 my favorite thing about this podcast is how we'll do something

00:58:47.09 and then just keep doing it like every week until we're bored of it we've

00:58:51.07 already done this oh man we just keep doing everything

00:58:55.03 twice it's really [ __ ] sucks this is so gross yes Geoff how would you describe

00:58:59.16 the taste is there anything like chocolate no I just bitter

00:59:03.18 many squares consistency three I'm on my third square

00:59:07.18 you better work faster eighteen to go oh my god Andrew how many

00:59:16.20 squares oh my god I broke them and just yeah nick what about you how many

00:59:24.13 squares in are you I've got seven left here in my mouth right now oh my god how

00:59:29.01 about the taste nick awful I would describe it as like

00:59:33.05 chocolate but with no ability to um get sugar or anything tasty just goo oh

00:59:41.18 wallow sugarless goo oh I would be surprised if Andrew wins with

00:59:49.11 everything in his mouth like it's hard to swallow stuff when your mouth is

00:59:53.18 completely full of other [ __ ] especially

01:05:10.12 I'm so surprised this is a trash fruit no that's that's insulting yeah the

01:05:15.16 taste like in other things I'm okay with it just by itself this is a garbage

01:05:20.21 fruit terrible there's no such thing as a garbage fruit all fruit is good

01:05:26.10 that's banana banana is the worst I can't even speak so Andrew was it uh

01:05:30.23 there was the chocolate better the second time or worse uh hmm

01:05:35.23 I just want to watch Nikki chocolate is what I've learned from the second

01:05:40.13 experience I don't understand what he did I don't know the approach

01:05:45.01 I followed your method I broke up all the pieces and wolfed them it's the

01:05:50.00 exact same brand the the lint 100

01:05:52.08 chocolate thing 100 excellence unsweetened chocolate how like

01:05:56.10 your mouth starts to reject it the second you put it in there

01:06:01.01 I may have an advantage because uh my wife and I tried to give up uh a lot of

01:06:05.23 processed foods years ago and uh to sell or any time we would actually have

01:06:10.02 something sweet this is as close as we could get there was no sugar so this was

01:06:15.07 what we would have oh so this is a clear like we're

01:06:18.16 adopting the darkness and and nick was born

01:06:25.03 we were on a different level going in the darkness of chocolate yeah [Music]

01:06:31.03 I was impressed though that was a hell of a performance by nick I did not nick

01:06:35.21 yours I was just super human yeah thank you that was really impressive I don't

01:06:40.08 know what it says about me as a person but you know here we are

01:06:45.05 I there was at when you finished at two and a half minutes I was

01:06:48.09 beginning to to entertain the idea of throwing up and I was only six seven

01:06:52.14 bars in maybe eight I don't know how you did it

01:06:55.12 I will say it was harder listening to you describe you vomiting in a toilet

01:06:59.23 and then hearing everybody gag that was the toughest part of the

01:07:03.18 turrets well I found the vomiting to be the toughest part but yeah

01:07:08.06 I'm saying for me the actual vomiting yeah oh

01:07:11.10 I I wouldn't I don't even think that nine and a half would have been doable

01:07:15.01 for me it was just so bad that was fun I feel good I feel way better than I did

01:07:19.10 the first time I did this this is a good experience overall I'm

01:07:23.04 never gonna do it again yeah that's another closed chapter I was miserable

01:07:27.22 Geoff the first time how many did you end up eating three six I think I had a

01:07:32.12 little bit less than half of it okay kind of hard to tell because I started

01:07:36.00 to break them up into tiny little pieces but yeah I'd say I had less than half

01:07:41.06 it's not a taste thing as much as it is you just need to start being able to

01:07:44.19 break it down is the issue yeah well and your body

01:07:47.23 doesn't want to swallow like your mouth doesn't want to smell it because it

01:07:51.11 doesn't recognize it as food yeah like I said it was sort of like swallowing

01:07:55.11 pills was how I was able to consume it yeah the first time is what I learned I

01:08:00.15 had to do yeah that was a show all right you should wrap up another

01:08:04.03 weird one I thought it was a fun episode yeah I had a great time

01:08:08.19 I enjoyed it too I always enjoy it it's always fun uh
