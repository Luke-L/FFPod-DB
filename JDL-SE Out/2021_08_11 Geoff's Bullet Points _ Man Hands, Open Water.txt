00:00:21.14 [Music]

00:00:28.12 [Music]

00:00:35.18 Are there any boy bands where the lead is the most talented I mean I think I

00:00:41.19 would think in sync you think no no yeah Justin Timberlake was not the

00:00:47.03 lead in nsync he was the side guy he was like I'm sorry what the

00:00:52.01 lead you're out of your [ __ ] mind dude yeah I uh I don't think you lived

00:00:56.06 through it like I had to are you what do you think like jc chazy

00:01:00.09 I'm not saying popularity I'm saying that like the structure of the group he

00:01:03.21 was not the captain of the team he was the all-star I don't uh was his name jc

00:01:09.03 Jason was not the lead in nsync he was he was

00:01:13.02 the captain of the team no absolutely no absolutely not every photo you see he's

00:01:17.22 the captain he's the leading guy you don't think he has leading vibes he is

00:01:21.06 leading vibes he's not the most talented he's the leader that doesn't have

00:01:24.06 leading vibes I mean like he had like a solo career and where did that go

00:01:28.04 terrible that's what I'm saying I've I just searched pictures of nsync and

00:01:32.12 there are so many pictures where he is not the center guy but Justin Timberlake

00:01:36.23 is you're out of your [ __ ] first one I pulled up he's the center guy I don't

00:01:41.14 know what you're talking you're out of your [ __ ]

00:01:45.16 mind when he's not okay that one he's not maybe with time this change you're

00:01:50.15 ridic this is right just this is my episode episode 63 yeah all yours

00:01:55.19 uh well where how do you follow that up you guys came in hot with the who was

00:02:01.18 the lead of in sync fight and I just stood back and let it happen

00:02:05.09 because I got no dog in that hunt who was the lead of instinct Gavin let

00:02:10.01 me guess Andrew was way off uh [Laughter]

00:02:13.03 maybe I was I I thought the other guy was the lead I'll be honest I don't know

00:02:17.12 anyone else's name from that band okay although there's the other guy who

00:02:22.01 according to Andrew is the head of nsync backstreet boys were way bigger were

00:02:26.15 they for a time definitely no backstreet boys are an international

00:02:30.21 sensation you don't think n sync was an international sensation they both are

00:02:35.14 not not to the same extent the coolest thing about the backstreet boys was

00:02:39.12 getting an album from burger king as a kid I don't I don't remember what the

00:02:43.03 promotion was exactly but you could get an album from a drive-through at burger

00:02:48.00 king it was fantastic did you get that time of course I did

00:02:51.12 I gotta say I'm gonna I'm gonna step back again and I'm gonna defer to your

00:02:55.06 expertise here gav because I never had I was never into nsync or backstreet boys

00:02:59.07 I didn't have the posters on the wall like you so I obviously

00:03:02.23 as I think you're a card-carrying member of both fan clubs I understand that you

00:03:08.19 know uh those two uh entities better than I so uh yeah hats off to you sir oh

00:03:13.14 thanks yeah uh big time fan of both what is this jc I'm just dropping it you

00:03:18.14 do a Google search of who is the lead in sync it's the top thing that comes up I

00:03:22.10 don't think I'm crazy in my take that johnny oh so was the lead of the band

00:03:26.10 was Timberlake like backup yeah he was like a side player um

00:03:30.19 he eventually became the king is this [ __ ] hang on

00:03:34.13 read what it says read that out loud yeah I'll read it I'll read it out loud

00:03:39.20 along with Justin jc chazza's with the lead singer of instinct I think the

00:03:43.21 Justin thing came later though I think that was the thing he was so talented

00:03:47.15 became co-lead I don't think he was always lead based on some of the music

00:03:51.09 videos and the photos why does it say I'm the only member of the band to

00:03:56.10 achieve solo success exactly well because that was accurate that's just a fact

00:04:00.18 it's also accurate but isn't that talking about Justin yeah well the

00:04:05.12 phrasing of that sentence is terrible then along with Justin jc chazy was the

00:04:10.06 lead singer of nsync oh yeah you're right that's a terribly written thing jc

00:04:14.05 chazza's is not the only one to achieve solo's success in music how I can you

00:04:19.05 say his last name a few more times I'm really enjoying it chazez Chaz

00:04:23.09 no yeah that's great that's great Eric Eric has said it for you about 10

00:04:27.11 times in the last three minutes I like your pronunciation no go ahead you say

00:04:31.20 say it again Eric I want to hear it it is jc chazay chazy that's that's what

00:04:35.23 that's your name I also love that below that little snippet there's a bbc

00:04:39.18 article that's headlined what happened to ensign members who aren't Justin

00:04:45.03 Timberlake that's part of the article what episode is this my friends uh 63 I

00:04:52.06 believe it's 63 and it's gonna be a good one

00:04:55.11 boys I'm very excited Geoff's been away yeah in a foreign land and

00:05:01.03 I haven't really spoken to him at all since he's been back just just

00:05:05.20 been having Geoff you've been sending us the most

00:05:09.06 interesting updates without any of the information and I've I honestly I've

00:05:13.14 been excited about recording all damn day okay I here's what I have a I wrote

00:05:19.01 some bullet points I I have a I have a recommended order

00:05:22.03 but I'll just read them off okay number one thing I want to talk about uh this

00:05:25.16 is just I'll just write down what I wrote or what I'll say what I wrote man

00:05:30.02 hands here's the next one open water here's the next one backpack

00:05:34.19 here's the next one this is from today purple nightmare

00:05:38.15 yeah it sure was it's followed you home the most recent one which I sent to you

00:05:44.09 guys about an hour ago two hours ago which was just this one just says

00:05:49.02 regulation fart and then I have a space for uh my

00:05:52.22 queries and insights which I don't know that we'll get through this episode but

00:05:56.10 we're recording too uh we're recording too uh because I think you're going to a

00:06:01.20 foreign land Gavin so we need to prepare

00:06:01.20 for that yeah oh uh well and and then uh whatever you want to talk about Gavin

00:06:06.22 and whatever you want to talk about Andrew because it is uh it's a quorum

00:06:10.23 goddamn I feel like I just want to listen yeah I'm really excited you

00:06:16.13 you texted me over a week ago at this point

00:06:19.16 boy do I have an ocean rescue story for you nothing else

00:06:22.23 and it's just has left me time to just admit I don't know what's happening I

00:06:26.16 don't know if you're being rescued I hope and my heart of heart my dream is

00:06:31.16 that you went on a jet ski expedition and it went

00:06:35.16 horribly wrong that required rescue before we hit Geoff's stuff the I have a

00:06:39.21 list of stuff but I think the only thing that I kind of want to

00:06:43.12 touch on is the stuff that just links us from previous episodes and it's super

00:06:47.01 cool what I liked is that because everyone was drawing the layout of your room

00:06:52.07 Andrew a lot of people a lot of the comment leavers uh drew some very accurate

00:06:57.20 stuff but then when we when that episode came out we posted the video that you

00:07:01.15 took where you were just sort of 360

00:07:03.14 degrees filming around the room and I noticed a

00:07:07.20 really bizarre line of thought across so many individual comment levers a lot of

00:07:13.01 people were blown away at how bright your room

00:07:16.09 was they were like wow it's so much brighter than I imagined oh weird it's

00:07:20.17 like it's really bright and I've realized

00:07:23.09 everyone has been imagining you in this dingy dark little room as if you record

00:07:28.18 every podcast in the dark and I don't know

00:07:31.22 how that sort of infiltrated their minds but there are so many comments that are

00:07:37.19 like wow that's just like a normal room

00:07:40.21 like you film like you record from some hole in the ground yeah as if yeah if

00:07:45.18 they expected it to be something other than human

00:07:49.01 exactly well so to a certain level I'm insulted but on the second point

00:07:53.01 I agree my room is way too goddamn bright I don't have like a proper

00:07:56.20 curtain for my big window for what they put in

00:07:59.16 so during the day it's a [ __ ] it's so bright in here it's terrible even at

00:08:03.16 night it's not great so beyond the insult I I agree with them my room is

00:08:07.21 way too bright I don't think they were saying it should be darker no but

00:08:11.12 they're just saying they're pointing out how bright it is I guess your statement

00:08:16.00 is that they're doing it in contrast to their expectation or I'm just saying as

00:08:19.18 a general room my room is brighter than most bedrooms I'd say with the curtains

00:08:24.02 down it's an ineffective curtain why'd you

00:08:27.05 want to be in a dark room I just like when you wake up in the mornings [ __ ]

00:08:30.13 the sun's blasting me in the face every morning I don't like it no

00:08:35.05 no I want the choice to do that I want to go over to the curtain and blast

00:08:40.07 myself I don't want the sun just blasting me whenever it feels like

00:08:43.19 that's totally achievable though just how would I do that blackout blind or

00:08:47.12 something yeah I need to do work I need to set that up I'm saying the blinds

00:08:50.19 that came with the place are not functional in that way I'd have to

00:08:54.10 modify it you know who can help is amazon can they yeah you buy curtains on

00:08:59.05 amazon well no but I have to install the curtains then it's not like I I need a

00:09:04.21 curtain rod I need to get a screwdriver I need a ladder

00:09:08.17 we're talking several steps here I feel like there's very little that you

00:09:12.12 can't do with a a drill and a just a drill really just in some bits

00:09:16.22 yeah some screwdriver bits you think I could do that job with a screwdriver yes

00:09:21.16 a chair is a ladder a desk is a ladder a screwdriver and you've got to have a

00:09:25.13 screwdriver in your house oh I definitely do but I feel like I need to

00:09:29.02 mount something to the wall this is a very specific setup these windows maybe

00:09:34.04 a little pilot hole get get the drills in there the the

00:09:37.01 certainly make it easier on you it would

00:09:38.19 I mean I could take a photo right now if you want I mean this is a I can't I'd

00:09:43.01 have to go above the window the way it's a poorly designed thing

00:09:46.12 I'll never turn down an opportunity to get a photo from you to be honest I'll

00:09:50.12 turn around take a photo.

00:09:53.03 I mean I figured you guys would feel the time

00:09:57.02 literally anything that was my cue too I'm gonna need a minute you guys fill

00:10:02.01 hey how's it going whistling now you don't need to I've missed you Geoff I've

00:10:05.19 missed you as well we still haven't filmed the the super badass bike stunt yet

00:10:10.15 unfortunately what are you doing tomorrow uh

00:10:14.02 I have a shitload of meetings tomorrow unfortunately

00:10:16.08 what are you doing Saturday Saturday let's do it okay let's oh

00:10:20.12 that's a nice that's a nice bright window oh lovely oh you know what you

00:10:24.06 could do you could just uh you could pop that

00:10:26.17 roller thing out and just put a darker one in like a thicker one you don't have

00:10:30.10 to use any tools for that could I yeah just measure the size look into like I'm

00:10:35.00 not good at measuring I'm a bad measuring person I'm not a measuring guy

00:10:39.09 I'm really bad at guessing length you don't have to guess that's why you

00:10:42.23 measure you don't have to guess I know I don't trust myself measuring takes the

00:10:47.05 guessing out measuring is the anti-guessing dude come

00:10:51.04 on it's it's a tough thing especially when dealing with like people in other

00:10:54.17 countries trying to explain things very difficult I'm not good at it as far as

00:10:57.19 what you're getting live advice from a foreign country

00:11:01.08 if I'm trying to like explain to somebody how

00:11:04.18 I don't know how tall something is or long I try to think of like objects they

00:11:09.11 would see or you could just use the measurement

00:11:12.15 you could just do just say 75 inches are you trying to relate more clothes are

00:11:16.12 you like talking to french people in in baguettes like what do you mean

00:11:20.18 okay so like one of the measurements I don't know

00:11:24.10 peter dinklage is somebody I've used in the past yeah just like a dinklage

00:11:31.11 so like I learned a dink so peter dinklage is one point two yards

00:11:37.07 so like whenever stop it one point two or more

00:11:44.17 well no it's just okay so now I'm a big football I love football every time it's

00:11:50.08 like third and one now in my head it's third in a dinklage and it's just I

00:11:54.17 don't know it's a fun visual they need to move the ball but no one knows

00:11:57.23 exactly how to be a dinklage is just off in their head nobody has that

00:12:01.20 information no but if somebody said like how tall is my mini fridge I'd assume

00:12:05.15 it's about the same height as peter dinklage and I don't know what the

00:12:08.23 height of my fridge is but I could say it's around the height of peter dinklage

00:12:12.13 and they would know cause they've seen peter dinklage I would I would love to

00:12:16.20 see a measuring tape that just measures and dinklages

00:12:20.23 tinklages is my main measurement that's easier to get a tape measure that's

00:12:26.04 easier like oh yeah peter did clinch can you come over and stand under this

00:12:29.12 cabinet honestly if they don't know how long a foot is what good is it even if I

00:12:33.19 have the exact measurement because it's numbers if I was like how tall is your

00:12:39.07 house you'd be like it's one minute bowl a LeBron James and the rock

00:12:43.20 I would say it's uh probably like the third story of a hotel two stories of a

00:12:48.13 hotel maybe I don't know I'd compare it to like a thing that everyone's seen I

00:12:53.09 need to understand that in dinklage I'm sorry

00:12:55.13 this is I don't know this is coming from

00:12:57.12 the man who who told me to put an eighth of a teaspoon of pineapple juice in my

00:13:01.22 sauce that was just me saying stuff

00:13:07.16 not good at it I'm not good at it I like that you

00:13:11.18 you then went to actually put a value to peter dinklage in terms of measurement

00:13:16.05 and you did it in the arts I did well because I was thinking within a football

00:13:19.19 context was having this conversation of like if you were gonna move the ball of

00:13:24.08 peter dinklage how far would it be and it was 1.3 or 1.2 yards I believe oh

00:13:30.05 man yeah well I I understand the problem now there's no there's no easy solution

00:13:34.05 for you to get blinds it's just going to

00:13:36.19 be bright for the rest of your life well

00:13:38.15 no it's there are tons of solutions they just require me to do some research and

00:13:42.17 I haven't done it yet ordering a dinklage of blinds you're

00:13:46.07 working in a vaccine lab or something oh my god I mean all I need to do is cover

00:13:49.15 my eyes with a pillow that's my technique I just bring the pillow over

00:13:52.22 the face and we're fine darkens out the whole room

00:13:56.08 it's perfect I can't see anything it's comfy I feel like I'm a little I'm

00:14:00.23 trapped a little a little enclosed it's great oh

00:14:04.06 god damn I did not expect to hear that today no I'm just talking about

00:14:08.23 distances I used to think a foot was the size of my foot I'd use my foot to

00:14:14.04 measure feet not an accurate representation although it might be how

00:14:18.19 many dink glitches per hour does a plane fly it

00:14:22.03 I don't I haven't expanded beyond a football scenario but that's a great

00:14:26.12 question you don't know dph no I don't I don't know dick glitch per

00:14:30.22 hour I think that just per hour is not a

00:14:33.00 measurement that uh I'm tracked speaking of planes that was a part of a clever

00:14:37.12 segue speaking of planes Geoff went on to play somewhere Geoff what happened

00:14:41.03 when you were there

00:14:44.02 Geoff what a great segue uh I had I had a fantastic vacation that's what I

00:14:50.15 is what I tried yeah god damn uh I uh well let's start at the

00:14:57.01 top man hands okay so that's an insight I went to uh I went to uh this place in

00:15:03.07 Mexico that I go um I'm just gonna sit back

00:15:06.08 first trip out of the states in a while uh and there's this little island it's

00:15:11.01 it's the easternmost point of Mexico it's called Isla mujeres and I I go there

00:15:16.06 uh fairly regularly I mean not since the pandemic obviously but um so this is my

00:15:20.12 first trip out uh the girlfriend and I and two of our grown-up non-rooster

00:15:26.06 teeth friends a couple all went together um

00:15:29.07 and we met some other grown up non-rich tooth friends

00:15:32.01 uh so it's like six couples uh and uh anyway so I went for a week and it's a

00:15:36.12 really cool it's a really cool little island it's like it's only about five

00:15:39.16 miles long and there's not really any cars on it so when you get there you

00:15:42.22 like have to take a ferry to get there and when you get there you run a golf

00:15:46.09 cart and you just drive around and swim and eat fun food and it's just really

00:15:51.01 charming and great and drive golf carts it's awesome it's fun anyway so uh they

00:15:55.13 have massages on the beach and uh I try to get a massage every day while I'm

00:15:59.15 there because they're super cheap and they're really good massages every day

00:16:03.20 yeah one a day like go swimming in the morning uh eat some lunch at the beach

00:16:08.07 go swim a little bit more then go get like a knock out like an hour long

00:16:11.07 massage and then go back and get ready for dinner right but surely by like day

00:16:15.03 five you're like okay I've done this yeah I've done it well trying to get one

00:16:18.17 every day doesn't mean getting one every day I would say in the six days I was

00:16:22.21 there I probably got four that's still a lot good

00:16:25.16 dude it doesn't feel like a lot I could have used another six or seven uh I got

00:16:29.19 a lot of stress in this body buddy uh it's gonna it takes those people a while

00:16:33.03 to work it out anyway so I've been doing

00:16:34.21 this for a long time it's it's like open air and it's breezy and you're like

00:16:37.20 smelling the ocean and you've got the way it's just really relaxing and uh I

00:16:42.06 had something it came up that's just never come up before in my entire life

00:16:46.02 which is we roll up on the first day uh and it's uh Emily and I both could

00:16:50.10 get our massages and it's always two ladies but this time it was a dude and a

00:16:54.19 lady and that's happened before too but always like I I don't I don't know if

00:16:58.18 these are like unspoken rules or whatever but the lady always massages me

00:17:02.06 and the dude always massages Emily right

00:17:04.12 I've never been massaged by a guy before in my life and this time the guy was

00:17:08.21 like let's go so I'm like okay cool I've never had a

00:17:12.06 massage by a guy before I wonder if it's any different at all you know so I lay

00:17:16.14 down and we get to work and I realized that men are superior to women in every

00:17:21.14 way I melted in that man's hands I felt I fe I was he worked out every sore

00:17:30.10 muscle and every every ounce of stress in my entire body with his strong

00:17:36.02 masculine hands I was a puddle I felt safe and secure I

00:17:41.07 was I didn't want to leave that bed dude

00:17:44.12 I I thought about that massage all night and then the next day I went back and I

00:17:48.07 was like where's the guy and he wasn't there but there was a different guy so I

00:17:51.15 got the different guy I'm never there's my insight I'm never getting massaged by

00:17:55.07 a a woman with tiny woman hands ever again for the rest of my life sorry

00:18:00.12 women I'm off limits I only want beefy strong sausage fingers dudes on me

00:18:05.03 it was amazing and I recommend every dude go out and get a massage by a dude

00:18:09.14 who's tougher than you immediately so I guess two things immediately for me

00:18:15.11 I'm I'd I've never gotten a massage in my life but I've known this to be a

00:18:18.17 thing you want the the the male massager it's just it's a deeper that's more

00:18:23.03 strength more hand strength that's just the thing I know so it's shocking to me

00:18:26.11 sounds like your real massage enthusiast that you weren't aware of this second

00:18:30.08 thing and most important detail at what day did you get the massage from the guy

00:18:35.05 uh how many massages in were you it was the first massage

00:18:39.09 this was on day two I didn't get a massage day one so this also explains

00:18:43.14 Geoff's sudden pursuit of massages every single day yeah like it increases

00:18:47.16 nothing yeah he is I've seen the light and he

00:18:50.09 now needs it as much as he possibly can get it that's why you're going there

00:18:53.14 every day and and I'll be honest the second dude wasn't as good as the first

00:18:57.09 dude but he was still really good and it was still amazing but I still am

00:19:00.19 thinking about the first guy a little bit and I wish I could remember his name

00:19:04.17 yeah he rocked my world and I'm not afraid to admit it I'm sure

00:19:09.13 you could just ask for a firmer massage from anywhere I asked for firm massages

00:19:14.10 it's different I'm telling you there's hand size there's like this raw I don't

00:19:18.14 know how else to describe it I've had a million massages in my life I've had

00:19:22.04 deep tissue massages I've had therapeutic massages I've had all kinds

00:19:25.17 of different massages it was just different so are you telling me that if

00:19:31.05 you went and got one this week you got a woman masseuse

00:19:34.14 I guess that's redundant um and then you ask for like as firm as she's got are

00:19:40.02 you saying it wouldn't come close I don't know I'm just saying I've never

00:19:43.17 experienced massages like the four three I got a woman the last day so three of

00:19:47.18 the four massages were men and I've never experienced massages like the

00:19:51.13 three that I got from men I think there are obviously going to be exceptions to

00:19:55.12 that that exists absolutely generally speaking there's probably it's

00:19:59.12 just you know it's a guys would have more hand strength I'd assume I've had a

00:20:04.23 few in my time um well yeah but the same though always always women

00:20:09.16 but I had one in japan and it was way too firm it she hurt me so much

00:20:14.17 I would have paid again at the end to have just gone back in time and not

00:20:19.22 done it yeah it wasn't about pain it wasn't like he like it was it's hard to

00:20:24.10 scream it's not like there was just like a strength there and I I don't know how

00:20:29.02 else to describe it but I wasn't saying like the guy hurt me any more than the

00:20:32.08 women do or anything I've had some painful massages from women it was just like

00:20:36.23 just a different vibe with a dude I don't know but I'm into it

00:20:41.14 and super into it yeah little revelation maybe yeah

00:20:44.02 I I recommend you do my friend please give a scouting report back Gavin I'd

00:20:48.12 love to I I can't I'm too ticklish for massages I'd love to get one two

00:20:53.01 ticklish they're not like yeah they're not tickling anybody no

00:20:56.09 I'm super ticklish like doesn't even matter I don't trust myself it would be

00:21:00.16 a disaster I wonder if they would charge you more though because as you've once

00:21:04.21 said you're all back so that potentially is more back it would be exhausting for

00:21:09.12 them and it would be stressful for me try not to laugh it'd be a terrible

00:21:13.11 experience oh Eric says Geoff is right interest ah

00:21:17.01 thanks Eric appreciate it you're right I've had massages from both and I prefer

00:21:21.12 I prefer uh male masseuse yeah it's just it's it's deeper

00:21:25.05 I feel like it's deeper tissue and a firmer hold deeper there's just

00:21:29.13 something to do it's way deeper they're getting in there the end men just

00:21:34.06 I'll say like this I've learned men know how to touch men

00:21:39.01 I'm just surprised andrew's never got one oh no I'm too ticklish [Laughter]

00:21:49.14 I just feel like there are places where I'm ticklish but during a massage

00:21:55.00 they're not they're not tickling me oh I'm super you don't understand the level

00:21:58.17 of ticklishness that I got going on over here it is a real problem I'm super

00:22:02.10 ticklish and I just don't want to risk it I don't want to roll those dice

00:22:05.12 because it was just a nightmare your body is just so unbalanced by the sounds

00:22:09.05 of you've got the strongest nose in the world but the most ticklish back yeah

00:22:13.17 yeah you're just lopsided ticklish everywhere so is your nose

00:22:17.20 I bet you you know what if you if you got someone in there who knew what they

00:22:21.15 were doing in the tickling game I would I'd probably laugh yeah probably

00:22:26.07 it probably thicker what does that mean I don't know I know I'm saying I don't

00:22:29.23 know the nose tickling technique but if you get a real tickling enthusiast in

00:22:33.13 there that knows their way around I'm sure that they'd get me but that's the

00:22:37.09 whole point the the masseurs and masseuses aren't gonna

00:22:41.22 tickle you no but it's a mental thing it's just something about the process I

00:22:45.14 don't know I'm super tick I'm just it's more of a paranoia thing too of if if I

00:22:49.18 don't want to risk that what if I am ticklish in that way because then what

00:22:53.13 do I do it's just a terrible scenario all right.

00:27:01.16 may have to wait till next episode for purple nightmare though all right I I'm

00:27:05.09 going to start this with a preface I'm going to preface this by saying I am

00:27:08.15 still reeling a little bit from how poorly I

00:27:12.17 told the horse story and have received a lot of criticism in my personal life

00:27:17.01 from people about it that are more familiar with the

00:27:20.22 story and I feel a particular fear uh in regards to this story because it's not

00:27:26.21 just my story I was one of four people that experienced this hell

00:27:31.11 so would you want to write it out no I have I have notes I apologize in

00:27:35.03 advance to Emily and joey and Tamara if I don't do the story justice I am really

00:27:39.11 sorry it's a lot it's a it's a mouthful it's a

00:27:42.14 lot to figure out and everybody because I've heard the story repeated about 100

00:27:45.15 times over the last week everybody has different parts that matter to them

00:27:49.23 right and so if I don't cover the part that matters to you the most I apologize

00:27:53.11 but it wasn't the part that mattered to me the most okay so for the sake of your

00:27:57.03 storytelling do you want us just to listen instead of ask questions no no

00:28:00.12 you can ask questions just do this like normal all right okay now uh while we

00:28:05.12 well first off let me say uh I I would like to tell you I had I woke up with a

00:28:10.21 nightmare the night before this happened and I had

00:28:14.07 a conversation with Emily I can't tell you what that conversation is yet

00:28:18.08 because it'll spoil the story but I'll tell you at the end if you remind me

00:28:22.05 come back to it okay it's non-linear nonlinear while we were in Mexico

00:28:27.00 uh we wanted to we decided to go snorkeling uh I will also say that I

00:28:31.11 have been snorkeling quite a few times in my life been snorkeling in the ocean

00:28:36.23 a few times been snorkeling at this very island Isla mujeres before

00:28:41.20 consider myself uh familiar with the snorkeling as a

00:28:46.17 concept and uh fairly experienced in it so previously I had snorkeled we'd done

00:28:50.18 some reefs like a you know a wreath and we'd done like an underwater museum that

00:28:54.03 they have out there that's really cool and uh this time there were a lot of

00:28:58.12 advertisements to go snorkeling with whale sharks so we started to look into

00:29:03.09 it and it seemed like this really cool opportunity I guess once a year whale

00:29:07.03 sharks come they they typically live uh I don't know a couple hundred feet below

00:29:10.12 water they're sharks not whales so they don't have to come up for oxygen uh but

00:29:14.09 they and they have giant mouths but they their mouths don't open they can't have

00:29:18.02 teeth so they they can only eat plankton

00:29:20.02 so they're not dangerous right and about once a year they will come up at this

00:29:24.12 spot in the ocean where the gulf coast and the and the I guess the

00:29:28.06 pacific ocean or Atlantic ocean meat or the oceans off Mexico and uh I guess

00:29:32.15 it's like it's like a feeding frenzy for them and there'll be hundreds out there

00:29:36.07 eating at the surface and manta rays too

00:29:38.13 and supposedly it's a really cool unique thing and so there were a lot of

00:29:42.23 advertisements to go uh snorkeling with with the whale sharks

00:29:46.16 and we had had such a positive experience snorkeling there previously

00:29:50.19 that we were like hey let's do that let's all do that and so

00:29:54.02 the whole big group of us were gonna go two people backed out so it ended up

00:29:57.11 just being me and Emily and our other two friends

00:29:59.13 the thing I liked about it is that it's it's it's like a weird thing to to

00:30:03.09 go snorkeling with like animals and I was a little worried about like is is

00:30:07.11 this appropriate and they were like yeah it's like it's really uh

00:30:10.11 ecologically minded they wouldn't let us wear sunscreen at all because the

00:30:15.00 sunscreen could irritate or affect the food or the whale sharks

00:30:19.03 in some negative way so we had to wear like we had to go and buy like full body

00:30:22.13 like wetsuit kind of deals because it was like this you know a thousand

00:30:26.13 degrees in the sun and it's like a four-hour tour right

00:30:30.10 very similar very similar to gilligan's island so we get there and

00:30:34.11 this lady comes out the lady who we bought the tour from we're sitting on

00:30:37.19 the on like right out right on the beach

00:30:39.19 there right in front of the boat and she comes up and she we talked to her for

00:30:43.09 about 15 minutes she gives us the rundown and we're like all right let's

00:30:46.19 get to it and she goes oh oh yeah no let me introduce you to the captain I'm not

00:30:50.00 I'm not the one that does it I just coordinate it and we're like okay so

00:30:53.18 then this captain comes out and he gives us a spiel about like he's really funny

00:30:57.00 and engaging and he's really well versed and they explain to us that it's you

00:31:00.04 know we're in their territory so we have to be respectful and he explains like

00:31:03.13 all the different scenarios where we could annoy a whale shark and how to

00:31:07.07 avoid it you know he's got all these little funny clips like quips like uh

00:31:10.18 you know how like when you're eating at a picnic and flies are buzzing around

00:31:13.18 while you're trying to eat your lunch though you're the flies so be respectful

00:31:18.15 yada yada and it's all really good information and uh and we can only go in

00:31:22.05 like two people at a time so like you know the other couple will go in and

00:31:25.15 when they come out we'll go in because we don't want to overwhelm the whale

00:31:28.13 sharks it's all designed with being really respectful to the whale sharks in

00:31:32.12 their environment which I think is pretty cool

00:31:34.12 and so he's like alright you guys ready and we're like yeah let's go and then

00:31:37.23 we're like point us to the boat and he goes oh no no I'm not taking you these

00:31:41.13 other guys are taking you and at this point I think well that's a little weird

00:31:45.00 I'm on my third person and surely at some point I'm going to talk

00:31:48.00 to the person that's going to take us out right so he takes us out to this he

00:31:51.13 actually just points to the boat and uh we go out there and there's these two

00:31:55.08 dudes on it uh like a captain and like a

00:31:57.19 diver dude right but was the first guy a captain he was like the head of the

00:32:01.22 company I guess he was a captain yeah so

00:32:04.01 anyway these guys we get there we get on the boat and it becomes apparent these

00:32:08.08 guys don't speak a lot of English uh and

00:32:10.01 you know why would they they're his panic and they're in Mexico right and so

00:32:15.14 there's a bit of a language barrier off the uh at the get-go which is fine you

00:32:19.08 know we make it work no big deal so we get in the boat and it's you know

00:32:23.03 it's not a big boat it's like one of those little boats you'd see off the coast

00:32:26.11 I don't know a lot about boats but it's got two little twin uh yamaha 150

00:32:30.17 engines on the back that's very important two twin yamaha 150 engines

00:32:34.12 boy does that become a big deal uh and uh you know it's one of those

00:32:38.05 boats it probably holds about 12 people it's just seats all the way around it's

00:32:41.11 not super fast and it's covered with like a tarp at the top you know like a

00:32:45.09 nice tarp and so they're like okay uh oh by the way I should mention one

00:32:50.02 thing that gave me pause is in the previous

00:32:54.13 instructions from the first captain who I thought was going to be taking us out

00:32:58.18 he mentioned that we were going about 50

00:33:00.21 miles off the coast in Oklahoma wow yeah 50 miles into the into the

00:33:08.20 ocean 50 miles and I thought that's that's a lot further than I thought it

00:33:14.00 would be and he goes yeah it's going to take about 45 minutes to get out there

00:33:18.10 it takes about 45 minutes in these little boats to get to go 50 miles

00:33:23.11 that's a fast boat yeah and uh like 404550 miles a summer it's

00:33:26.12 it's like it's it's not a exact science right it's like wherever the whale

00:33:30.08 sharks are that day but it's a you know he said it's about you know

00:33:33.12 70 to 85 kilometers or so which I in my head is about 45 to 50 miles right I

00:33:39.05 think uh anyway it's pretty [ __ ] far out there so we hop in the boat and I'm

00:33:43.02 not I don't get seasick I'm not uneasy about this I've been uh whale watching

00:33:48.00 before the whole thing but they recommend we

00:33:50.18 take drama mine uh for nausea and so I'm like [ __ ] it I will yeah like why not

00:33:54.18 you know why why why tempt fate so I take we all take our drama mine not that

00:33:59.12 I think it's gonna be an issue at all then we take off

00:34:02.12 and we uh we start to go and after about I don't know 15 minutes or so I realize

00:34:07.18 we're we're not going really fast and I look over and the uh

00:34:12.00 the guy is like [ __ ] with the with the controls trying to get one of the

00:34:16.15 like one of the engines is pegged and the other one is just like going back

00:34:20.00 and forth he's trying to and the other guys back there kind of kicking it and

00:34:24.02 looking at it and uh we realize uh they they start screwing we we slow down and

00:34:27.12 I'll say if we were going in fifth gear like if this was a car we're going in

00:34:31.05 like third gear now and uh they're like speaking to each other and I can't quite

00:34:35.09 understand it they seem agitated the vibe starts to shift I'll I'll say that

00:34:40.04 the vibe it just doesn't seem as pleasant as it

00:34:42.23 was and uh there is obviously a problem with one of the engines

00:34:47.01 I could still see land we're like I said 15 minutes out we're like maybe 10

00:34:50.15 minutes out I can still see land so I'm kind of not too worried but I'm also

00:34:55.01 like well we can just go back and they're like

00:34:57.09 they kind of wave us off when we're like do we need to you know they're like

00:35:01.15 and uh they go back there and he's like kicking the engine and he's like working

00:35:04.23 on it and we just keep going the other guy just goes forward with one engine

00:35:08.00 while the other guy tries to fix the first engine eventually he gives up and

00:35:12.21 we just go forward with one engine at this point we're

00:35:15.13 3040 minutes out and I'm like oh well we've only got about 10 minutes before

00:35:19.08 we'll be at the 10 minutes 20 minutes before we'll be at the the whale sharks

00:35:22.10 right but I start to notice that boats come by

00:35:25.18 and they're passing us like we're sitting still and uh and I realized

00:35:29.15 they're going way way way faster than us because they're in fifth gear because

00:35:34.04 both of their engines work we're we're going like third on one engine and uh

00:35:38.13 it's starting to get real bumpy in third gear uh when you're going in fifth gear

00:35:42.17 you're cutting right through those waves when you're going in third gear you are

00:35:46.05 not we are getting kind of battered around like I'm starting to get a bruise

00:35:49.21 on the back of my lower back from getting slammed into the back of the

00:35:53.12 boat over and over again and we're not like nauseous or anything but it's not

00:35:57.07 pleasant right we do that uh the 45 minute ride out to

00:36:01.07 the whale sharks ended up being a little over an hour and a half

00:36:04.15 by the time we roll up I see the boats out there we're all feeling pretty

00:36:08.13 pretty worn out like it's been a long hour and a half getting blasted in the

00:36:13.12 sun with no sunscreen getting jostled around going like we're bobbing like uh

00:36:18.12 [ __ ] [ __ ] because we're not going that fast we get out there and

00:36:23.07 first off I thought this was going to be this intimate experience there's 40

00:36:26.17 boats in the water and I don't know how they're not slamming into each other

00:36:30.01 because this is open [ __ ] ocean like I I haven't seen land in an hour at this

00:36:36.06 point we are so far out there and I'm I discover I'm not super cool with that

00:36:39.22 like I'm okay with it uh obviously we're safe but it's weird to be in that small

00:36:46.08 of a boat that far away from something from land right

00:36:49.08 and all these boats and it's getting rid

00:36:51.14 so there's all these boats like floating around and I noticed that on on every

00:36:54.15 boat two or three people are hanging off the boat just throwing up like I'm

00:36:58.09 probably watching I'm probably watching 20 people puke at the same time I like

00:37:02.12 that that there's no sunscreen but you're allowed to just vomit all over

00:37:06.00 well I don't I don't I don't think they had a choice dude there was no there's

00:37:10.06 no way to hold it in right and so uh the waves are [ __ ] huge too here and

00:37:14.12 then the guy comes over and he gives there's not even a discussion of who's

00:37:16.12 getting the water yet he just gives Emily and I flippers and we brought our

00:37:19.21 own snorkels because we thought that'd be the safest with kovan stuff and so he

00:37:23.21 the guy goes here put these on and so we're like I'm like putting him on and

00:37:27.20 she's like putting hers on and before the guy had given us the spiel the cat

00:37:31.09 the first captain had given a spiel when you get in the water just look straight

00:37:34.12 down just look straight down there's no whales above you the whale sharks are

00:37:37.23 gonna be below you uh you but you also need to keep in mind where the boat is

00:37:42.14 where the diver is and where your partner is at all times but also don't

00:37:46.10 look up only look down and I'm like well that seems complicated

00:37:49.19 so and I'm interested to see how that's going to work in practice so anyway he

00:37:53.11 gives us these I'm starting to just like

00:37:55.10 casually put a thing on and then the guy screams go go now go now go go now and

00:38:00.09 Emily and I are like what what and we're not even sure if it's us and he's just

00:38:04.06 pointing at us going go now go now and then he goes over and he he points to

00:38:08.00 him and he jumps in the water like we're

00:38:09.22 supposed to do and we're like ah and the other guy's like duh now and we're like

00:38:13.09 uh and so we're like putting our flippers on and we just drive jump into

00:38:18.06 the water right jump into a a huge roiling ocean full of people and waves

00:38:22.23 and boats and my my uh my snorkel flies off one of my uh

00:38:26.15 one of my fins flies off my foot and so I'm like in open ocean trying to put my

00:38:31.17 [ __ ] fin back on and trying to fit my snorkel on while I'm bouncing around and

00:38:36.10 uh and like a wave will come up and I can't see anything it's just I can't see

00:38:40.11 anybody and then the wave will crash back down and I'll suddenly see 40 boats

00:38:43.15 and 100 people and it's [ __ ] scary and I'm like looking around so I just

00:38:46.18 start looking at the ground like looking in in the ocean and all I just see is

00:38:50.07 blue just like hundreds of feet of blue and nothing it's the scariest thing I've

00:38:53.11 ever seen and I'm like where are these [ __ ] whale sharks and then I'm like

00:38:55.11 oh I gotta look at Emily I gotta look at the guy right so I look up and Emily's

00:38:59.01 over there so I like to try to grab her hand and she grabs mine and then the

00:39:00.21 guy's like the guy's like hey and he's like yelling at me and I'm like oh [ __ ]

00:39:03.16 what and I don't understand what he's saying he's like ah and he just starts

00:39:05.20 pointing he's like follow the photo and I'm like that's why I just started

00:39:09.03 swimming and start swimming right and start swimming and then he's like get

00:39:12.12 out of the boat and I'm like okay so like they were like trying to get on the

00:39:16.04 [ __ ] boat and the waves are crashing I'm like slammed against the side of the

00:39:17.14 [ __ ] boat and I eventually climb up the ladder and by the time I get back in

00:39:21.07 the ladder we've been in the water for 45 seconds to a minute maybe I'm

00:39:25.03 exhausted Emily looks like she just she Emily looks like she is [ __ ] done and

00:39:29.00 we're both like what the [ __ ] was that and then I just hear chatter over the

00:39:31.01 radio going no whales no whale sharks no well sharks and then we just start and

00:39:34.17 the guy's like no shark's here and then we just take off and I'm like what the

00:39:38.19 [ __ ]

00:39:40.19 And I look at Emily and she goes what I look at Emily and she goes I'm not

00:39:44.06 getting back in the water and I go yeah I know I I I will they'll go next

00:39:47.12 they'll go next and then we just start going and we're just leaving all these

00:39:51.04 other boats behind and that actually scares me because we're going off on our

00:39:54.05 own and all I can hear is chatter over the radio of them saying like no whale

00:39:57.07 sharks here whatever so like we're going to another location right but we're

00:40:00.14 going in third gear again and we're going slow and at this point the dip

00:40:04.20 into the the terrifying dip into the open ocean and then getting slammed

00:40:09.13 around and then slammed into the boat and then back up in uh I'm I'm starting

00:40:15.03 to get a little a little seasick at this point and we go for

00:40:19.03 I want to say another oh 30 or 40 minutes further out into the ocean and

00:40:27.16 eventually uh I'm starting to wonder if these guys are just taking us out to

00:40:31.21 dump us because there's nobody around and it's scary and there's no

00:40:35.15 communication and they're they're they're I can tell these guys are

00:40:39.02 getting more stressed by the boat oh I should also point out I'm starting to

00:40:42.14 smell a lot when we got into the water and we came back into the back of the

00:40:46.08 boat we're smelling a ton of gasoline like it's a very intense smell of

00:40:49.18 gasoline at the back of the boat and Emily and I are like this no sunscreen

00:40:52.19 good I have a question no let's put in the story am I supposed to know what the

00:40:55.20 hell happened back there uh back where at the back of the world that would let

00:41:01.09 this like go now like no that you don't know anything more than I do

00:41:05.08 we go to the we go to the spot where the

00:41:07.12 whale sharks are we they scream at us to jump in we jump in then they scream at

00:41:11.18 us to get out and then we just take off and they're like there were no whale

00:41:15.02 sharks there and then eventually in that 30 minutes boats start slamming past us

00:41:19.02 again like we're standing still we get to another location this time there's

00:41:22.03 about 20 boats the whole thing happens again uh they like throw the stuff at

00:41:26.07 joey and Tamara they're like you guys get ready uh I should also point out at

00:41:30.05 some point that this is supposed to be a luncheon ceviche where they perverse

00:41:34.01 prepare ceviche live in front of you and

00:41:35.23 they have gourmet sandwiches and [ __ ] uh

00:41:38.08 not that I'm hungry at this point uh but other people are and uh we we get out

00:41:43.22 there and there it's even worse there and there's

00:41:47.07 less boats there and it's like the waves are even worse and there's just like no

00:41:51.16 whale sharks and they're like no sharks here we go again and

00:41:55.14 I think Tamara goes no no that's enough no we're not going to another location

00:42:00.10 we're good just take us back we're done like we're two and a half hours into

00:42:04.06 this we've been getting slammed left and right I'm [ __ ] not feeling well Emily

00:42:08.15 looks like she's feeling terribly joey seems

00:42:11.23 fine uh he owns a boat and that then the other girl Tamara she lived on a yacht

00:42:16.13 for uh like like a sailboat for a couple years not a yacht but a sailboat for a

00:42:19.19 couple years so like they're well-versed sea people and joey's fine Tamara looks

00:42:23.10 like she's not feeling great either and so the guy's like he kind of shrugs and

00:42:26.20 it's like okay so we turn around and we just start heading we think back we're

00:42:30.03 looking like we're looking on a compass on our phone like yeah we're headed

00:42:33.22 towards land I guess this is the way and it's we just start going a little bit

00:42:37.09 slower and a little bit slower and at some point they throw sandwiches at us

00:42:41.14 and I open mine up and it's uh it's just

00:42:44.13 two pieces of like white bread with like as as it was described if uh

00:42:48.15 it was one slice of ham sliced on a one like it was like you could see through

00:42:52.04 it and there's just a shitload of mayonnaise so the mayonnaise is a

00:42:55.01 non-starter for me right so I just I'm like well I'm not gonna do that and then

00:42:59.12 I see the ceviche it's a literally a five gallon like home depot

00:43:03.12 bucket just full of shrimp but I'm like yeah it doesn't look appetizing either

00:43:07.17 just open shrimp in a five gallon bucket so I'm like clearly I'm not eating on

00:43:13.03 this trip uh but I'm not super hungry anyway

00:43:15.11 it's like bread and a bucket of chum yeah bread in a bucket of chum is what

00:43:19.00 we're looking at and so and there's no diet coke by the way

00:43:21.22 what's really that was the thing that pissed me off they only had coke and

00:43:26.13 sprite no diet coke and so uh so I'm just trying to drink a

00:43:29.21 sprite and I'm feeling really bad and emily's I can tell feeling really bad

00:43:34.21 and we're now 45 minutes into the trip back

00:43:37.18 and the boat keeps going slower and I'd say about yeah about 45 minutes

00:43:43.03 uh I noticed that we're not really going we just seem to be kind of uh kind of

00:43:47.14 floating uh well I should I should go back I

00:43:50.03 should dial back to uh maybe about 20

00:43:52.01 minutes before this moment we're sitting there and I'm rocking and uh and then I

00:43:56.08 realized I'm absolutely going to throw up uh there was no way to hold it back

00:44:00.08 and so I run over to the side of the boat and I throw up a good

00:44:04.12 five or six times huge vomit and is the boat moving oh yeah so slowly but it is

00:44:09.03 moving and I'm like you know just this is [ __ ]

00:44:13.18 ocean nausea vomiting right it's not pretty it's a horrible sound oh henry's

00:44:20.20 here yeah that's right you [ __ ] that toy up

00:44:24.06 this story's the just the best I hope it never ends

00:44:27.20 oh well we got a ways to go uh so uh I turned back to look at Emily because

00:44:33.01 she's like are you alright and she sees me and she almost throws up in her mouth

00:44:36.16 and turns away and goes I can't look at you I can't look at you and I'm like oh

00:44:40.07 my god what and I don't know I just like

00:44:42.12 him sitting there and uh and I sit there for a while and emily's just like I

00:44:45.16 can't I can't I can't I can't look you I'm gonna throw up I couldn't figure out

00:44:48.17 why I thought it was because I thrown out over the ocean uh after a few

00:44:52.06 minutes like maybe about five minutes after I calmed down I I

00:44:55.08 touched my face and I realized I'm cut my face is covered in puke and Emily

00:45:00.02 said later it looked like I drank a cappuccino of vomit and it was just like

00:45:03.14 I had like a cappuccino mustache of puke around you know and so I'm like

00:45:08.06 trying to wipe it off and you see water and oh boy he's Henry

00:45:13.09 give it a break on the octopus god oh yeah now settle in hunker down that's

00:45:19.16 good yeah he's getting cozy so he can really is that different to the owl that

00:45:23.21 you usually have yeah he allows in the other room this is okay this is puss

00:45:27.20 puss as we call it uh a little blue octopus uh so uh so uh

00:45:33.09 at this point I lay down and I'm like I gotta go to sleep because I'm exhausted

00:45:38.10 and I start to fall asleep just laying on the side of the boat like just

00:45:41.08 holding my tummy and I wake every time I wake up as I'm falling to the floor or

00:45:45.11 my head is slamming back into the side of the ocean from the waves right so now

00:45:49.12 so that's where I was for 20 minutes eventually I'd get up and uh then I

00:45:52.16 realized that we're going really slow at some point in this we're probably about

00:45:56.00 45 minutes into the return and I look back there and I realize

00:45:59.11 neither engine is going and I hear the guy trying to start it and trying to

00:46:04.00 start it and uh and then for the next 30 minutes I can

00:46:07.13 only describe I can only say uh I watched two men try to get an

00:46:12.15 it took me a while to piece together what was happening there was a lot of

00:46:16.10 yelling there was a lot of screaming on the mic on the over the radio

00:46:20.05 I just keep hearing caliente caliente over the radio caliente and I look and

00:46:24.11 then I realized I guess the other engine the one that was working has overheated

00:46:28.15 from from excessive use and so the guy is literally standing on

00:46:33.11 the top of it trying to push it into the ocean to submerge it to cool it down

00:46:40.13 so now we're in a situation where I think we're gonna die

00:46:45.05 we're probably gonna die I haven't seen land in three hours

00:46:49.05 I've been beaten to hell banged around uh uh for hours and hours I've got no

00:46:55.05 food in me the only food available is slathered in mayonnaise and chum

00:47:00.12 and I got a I got a I got a half a sprite to my name and uh

00:47:05.01 and this guy's trying to trying to submerge the boat to save the engine you

00:47:09.22 know essentially and so they eventually work out a system

00:47:13.08 where we'll they drive for a few minutes really slowly if we were in third gear

00:47:16.22 before we're in first gear now which by the way first gear and ocean open ocean

00:47:21.05 you don't go forward it's like you you kind of go in whatever direction the

00:47:24.03 ocean tells you to go with a little bit of zeal you know just a little gusto in

00:47:27.20 that direction so we're just getting we're going left we're going right we're

00:47:31.17 going back occasionally forward very rarely or we go we're certainly not

00:47:34.19 going in a straight line and we're not going anywhere right

00:47:38.06 and every once in a while the engine will conk out and then we'll

00:47:42.02 it'll be too caliente and they'll be like trying to cool it down and then

00:47:44.06 after a few minutes they'll like

00:47:48.00 get started again and then we'll go for a few more minutes and then it'll it'll

00:47:52.13 stop and we're like what is going on how long till we get back and the guy

00:47:57.02 goes 30 minutes and I'm like there's no [ __ ] way we're going to be back in 30

00:48:01.08 minutes we're not we're hours away from land at this point I don't even know

00:48:05.03 that we're headed in the right [ __ ]

00:48:06.22 direction uh it's brutal and then sure enough about 30 minutes later two boats

00:48:12.10 show up on the horizon and I mean I'm thinking about writing

00:48:15.08 like writing my goodbyes at this point like I don't know what else to do we're

00:48:19.08 just getting slammed left and right I'm beyond nauseous

00:48:22.19 joey seems fine like he's having a great day Emily looks like she wants to die

00:48:27.10 just tucking into the chum he's fine he's fine he's happy he doesn't get

00:48:30.16 seasick he's uh he's loving life right tamara's doing

00:48:33.10 she I found out later it was to keep herself from from vomiting she was doing

00:48:36.23 new york times crossword puzzles on her phone which I don't know how you I don't

00:48:41.02 know how that kept her from vomiting because any time I made any time I

00:48:44.09 focused on anything it made me want to vomit uh anyway two boats show up on the

00:48:49.12 horizon and we're like what's this and they're like

00:48:53.01 one of the boats and the guys aren't talking to us they're in a bad bad mood

00:48:56.20 and we're in a bad mood and I can tell this has been very stressful on them

00:49:00.08 probably not as stressful as it's been on us but maybe ignorance is bliss I

00:49:03.16 don't know how close to dead we are right this other boat full of it's

00:49:06.18 another whale watching to whale shark watching tour full boat right it gets a

00:49:12.00 little close to us and the guy turns to us and he goes uh

00:49:15.18 they're gonna take you back and we're like oh so we're gonna get on that boat

00:49:19.07 and he goes yeah and I go how and he goes go go now go down I'm gonna go what

00:49:24.18 what and he goes go down get in the ocean go now and we're like what our

00:49:28.12 stuff and he goes don't worry about it go down I've got your stuff and we're

00:49:32.02 like what and we all dive into the ocean and then we have to swim through these

00:49:38.08 giant waves and crazy with no flippers on or anything just like I got my hat on

00:49:42.19 my clothes I'm like I just [ __ ] swim barely to get to beat slam against this

00:49:47.09 other boat which is way too far away I get there pull ourselves up get on the

00:49:50.23 boat right no idea what just happened look back and I'm like all our stuff's

00:49:54.15 on that boat and then I see I see all of our [ __ ] just flying through the air

00:49:58.16 from one boat to another they're just chucking it at us right just like there

00:50:02.12 goes my bag there goes emily's bag there

00:50:04.14 goes somebody's hat and I realized oh my god my phone and my wallet are in my

00:50:09.01 [ __ ] there's my shoes through my shoes 30 feet in the air over open ocean with

00:50:14.05 my phone and my [ __ ] wallet in it I [ __ ] run up there there we didn't

00:50:17.22 lose anything but I was like I was like I couldn't believe it dude it was the

00:50:21.13 most horrific thing I've ever seen is like just all of our [ __ ] like puckling

00:50:25.11 exploding on the ground on the boat right

00:50:30.00 then those guys the boat we're on where they like they

00:50:33.18 like sit down we sit down for a second then we just take off and those guys as

00:50:39.07 far as I know they're still there we just left them that we just left them

00:50:45.00 bobbing in the ocean and we assaulted some other crews right so then

00:50:49.10 we're on this other cruise it becomes very quickly very apparent very quickly

00:50:52.22 nobody on this boat speaks English either the people on the cruise are from

00:50:56.12 somewhere in eastern Europe and then the boat captain and stuff there and so

00:51:00.01 they're like all the seats in the back they communicate to us all the seats in

00:51:03.12 the back are full you're gonna have to sit up front we're like yeah okay why

00:51:06.12 nobody who cares whatever we're just happy to sit so we sit up front and then

00:51:11.11 they crank this thing into fifth gear suddenly we're going

00:51:14.07 nausea goes away immediately like a light switch we start cutting through

00:51:18.12 the waves but the reason nobody wanted to sit up

00:51:21.20 front is because every wave we get drenched I'm talking torrential like 17

00:51:27.14 buckets of 175 gallon buckets of water thrown in your face all at once which is

00:51:33.12 quite refreshing uh after everything else and then we just rock it back just

00:51:38.12 drenched from head to toe but the nausea is gone I couldn't be

00:51:42.19 happier I'm just I'm just my I'm smiling from ear to ear uh so much I'm just

00:51:47.21 swallowing gallons of salt water because I don't even care because it's just

00:51:51.04 slamming me in the face like a [ __ ] it's like a movie I can imagine you seeing

00:51:54.22 like hope you see all the things that are good in life and you just you

00:51:58.15 picture a nice set of man hands waiting for you

00:52:02.08 to get the biggest [ __ ] massage and uh so then we we start to pull back

00:52:05.23 up to Isla mujeres and I we put two and two together on their tour it goes to a

00:52:10.19 a sandbar by the beach but the previous tour we had done this as well where you

00:52:14.01 go to this like sandbar off the coast where the water is really brewing pretty

00:52:17.18 and then people go swimming and then so we get there and we dot like they throw

00:52:20.19 down the anchor and they're like okay they communicate we're gonna be here for

00:52:22.02 about 15 minutes go swimming relax then we'll cook up some fresh ceviche for you

00:52:27.12 and then we'll take you guys back to Cancun and we're like hey

00:52:31.08 uh I swimming is the last thing on earth I want to [ __ ] do right now b

00:52:35.12 I won't be eating again anytime soon and see did you say Cancun and they're like

00:52:40.08 yeah yeah this this charter goes to Cancun

00:52:42.09 and I'm like no no no we're here on this island take us to a dock on this island

00:52:46.12 and he's like no we don't we don't go to a dock on this island we dock in Cancun

00:52:51.03 and I'm like yeah yeah but we're already here and Cancun is a 35 it's 35 miles

00:52:56.00 that way and then when we get to Cancun we have no way to get back so then we'll

00:52:59.11 have to figure out how to get from your dock to the ferry and then we'll have to

00:53:03.10 the ferry only runs every 30 minutes so we'll have to buy tickets and then we'll

00:53:07.05 have to take a ferry all the way back to where we are right now so if you could

00:53:10.06 just take us to a dock and the guy's like now now you can swim and then we'll

00:53:13.11 take you back to Cancun so I'm like [ __ ] this and [ __ ] you I

00:53:16.11 look at the guys and I'm like we're swimming in and they're like what and I

00:53:20.12 grab I look it looks like I can stand I grab all of our stuff I give joey the

00:53:24.14 rest of it because the girls aren't tall

00:53:26.11 enough they jump in the water I jump I I jump in the water with all the stuff on

00:53:29.22 my head I like all of our bags and shoes and everything on her head wait how far

00:53:34.15 out are you uh I mean like a couple hundred 300 feet maybe

00:53:39.01 it's a sandbar it's a long walk but it but I hit the water and I I feel a sting

00:53:44.12 on my finger as I hit the water and I'm like getting off the off the stairs uh

00:53:48.01 off the boat and I'm like ah [ __ ] but I can't see anything because my hand is

00:53:51.10 you know my hands are above my head like I'm you know I'm going down to the

00:53:54.10 watering hole to fill up the watering can and then I'm walking it back up to

00:53:57.12 the village right on top of my head with all of our [ __ ] and the water is just

00:54:00.20 about to my chin and joe's a little bit taller than me so about the same the

00:54:05.14 girls have to swim and we very very slowly walk onto the beach holding

00:54:09.19 everything amidst all of these like sunbathers and people playing beach

00:54:15.05 volleyball and jet skis you came from yeah and we're like we

00:54:18.15 look like refugees you know just coming in from open ocean a bit like a long

00:54:23.10 walk in and we get to the beach and I [ __ ] put that stuff on the ground for

00:54:26.15 a second and I'm like oh my god and I look at my hand and my hand is covered

00:54:30.17 in blood and I'm like my left finger I see on my left finger

00:54:35.03 where my uh on my pinky finger the area like to the left of the nail I guess it

00:54:40.15 got caught on the stairs and it's just ripped a gash open where like a giant

00:54:46.11 chuck on my flesh is pulled open and it's just shooting blood out and I'm

00:54:50.01 like ah [ __ ] so I'm like I'm not getting

00:54:51.22 stitches or anything right and so I just like I eventually get a a band-aid and

00:54:55.23 put it on and uh and then I have to deal with that for the rest of the trip

00:55:00.01 but then we just [ __ ] take a cab from that point we just walk up to a cab take

00:55:05.03 a cab back to the dock get in our golf cart and go home uh now the thing that I

00:55:09.09 didn't mention uh that I couldn't tell you is I woke up that night the morning

00:55:13.08 of that trip at three in the morning with a nightmare and Emily happened to

00:55:15.18 wake up too and she goes what's wrong and I go I have a nightmare I had a

00:55:18.18 nightmare was really serious and she goes well it was your nightmare and I

00:55:22.08 dreamed we were out on the boat and we got stuck like open water and there was

00:55:25.09 nobody to rescue us and we were just floating there forever and then

00:55:28.15 eventually we died and she's like well that's not going to happen go back to

00:55:29.18 bed

00:55:32.13 so there was this like underlying tension did you ever like give each

00:55:36.21 other little looks yeah the whole trip the whole the whole time yeah

00:55:41.22 yeah nobody wanted to mention it now so I think I did it okay there I hope I

00:55:46.21 covered that properly oh and I don't know if it's if

00:55:51.07 it's been apparent at any point but at no point

00:55:55.09 in this six it was over six hours seven hours did I see a whale shark

00:56:00.08 I would love to see like the gps path on a on a map of where the hell you went

00:56:06.06 I'd love to know like at what point was the gps tracking a phone in a shoe

00:56:11.00 flying 30 feet between two oh my god dude there was about

00:56:15.22 an hour where I thought we were gonna die and about 30 minutes in the middle

00:56:21.01 of that where I wanted it I was just so nauseous and unhappy and just beat to

00:56:26.12 hell from the sun and just and starving but nauseous

00:56:35.11 yeah we didn't get a refund they wouldn't give us a refund

00:56:43.05 oh what a disaster how many days in was that to your trip that was day three of

00:56:51.18 seven I think or something okay so nice in the middle yeah

00:56:55.14 what a bonding experience though yeah yeah we all I mean we we

00:57:00.21 we bonded over tragedy dude I'm telling you

00:57:03.22 having to having a guy scream go go now when you are not ready to get an open

00:57:09.05 ocean and swim 30 feet to another boat and not sure what's supposed to happen

00:57:14.21 when you get there is not a fun experience I just don't understand how

00:57:19.17 whenever there are instructions for you to like get in the sea or get in the

00:57:24.23 boat or switch boats why was it always so frantic we don't know I I don't know

00:57:29.18 don't I just don't know I don't know I I don't know I I I wish I could tell you

00:57:34.14 but I'll tell you this we've all agreed nobody was up for it by the end of this

00:57:37.19 trip so exhausted but we're all getting go go now tattoos because that's all we

00:57:41.18 said to each other for the rest of the trip go go now anytime anything you want

00:57:45.07 to go you want to go get dinner don't go now because it was

00:57:49.10 I will hear that on my deathbed go go now I'll never forget that man those two

00:57:54.13 men screaming those two times the way that they were screaming that I

00:57:59.00 was hard expecting like a an out of control boat with no

00:58:03.08 brakes just coming hurtling towards you and he was like jump out yeah

00:58:07.06 I'm starting to wonder it's like what was the boat gonna catch fire any second

00:58:11.04 like were we expecting as we were as we were boat as we were like [ __ ]

00:58:14.14 speeding away I kept waiting to see if there was like a little little mushroom

00:58:17.15 cloud behind me you know uh like I don't know if they were just

00:58:20.18 like the guys would just stress the [ __ ]

00:58:23.09 out because they were also 40 or 50

00:58:23.09 miles out into open ocean with a boat that didn't work and they didn't know

00:58:28.10 how to get back or what but and they couldn't fix it but god [ __ ] damn it

00:58:32.11 dude that was not the place to be and it was not a fun experience and I

00:58:37.11 not the place to be for the whale sharks apparently either no yeah yeah and I'm

00:58:42.04 I'm kind of glad I didn't see him because what was it felt gross when we

00:58:45.11 were out there there's like a ton of people in the water there's a million

00:58:47.09 boats and people are throwing up lots of kind of feelings

00:58:50.21 if I was a whale shark I wouldn't come

00:58:53.03 within a thousand miles of this [ __ ] you

00:58:55.07 know so how long were you in the water uh I was in the water for about a minute

00:58:59.01 going from one end of the boat to the other while

00:59:02.21 the guys screamed no sharks here no sharks here and then uh and then I was

00:59:08.17 in the water for the for the uh for the daring mid ocean rescue maybe

00:59:13.09 90 seconds to maybe take 90 seconds so the rescue is longer than the whale

00:59:18.13 shark experience yes the rescue was longer than the whale shark experience

00:59:21.23 and there wasn't a whale shark experience for joey and Tamara they

00:59:24.16 never got in the water so their their experience was only the rescue experience

00:59:29.03 and then the 45 minutes of just getting of having

00:59:32.08 somebody spray a garden hose in your face on the way home

00:59:37.16 oh it sounds so miserable it's terrible that's horrendous a great Geoff vacation

00:59:43.16 honestly yeah yeah they're never they're rarely boring

00:59:47.07 uh and I realized we're out of right about an hour uh that was only the first

00:59:52.08 two of my one two three four five six things

00:59:54.22 so let me hit you up with backpack real fast this is a quick one

00:59:58.04 uh we're coming up coming home from Mexico uh trip home all kinds of [ __ ]

01:00:02.01 up global entry isn't working right well the passport isn't working right I get

01:00:05.11 it it's like coveted issues right but so it was kind

01:00:08.12 of a stressful trip home you know what it's like coming in going through

01:00:12.06 immigration all that stuff we finally get there we land in Dallas we land in

01:00:17.12 uh Gavin you know we land in d24 and I gotta go to b

01:00:20.23 seven or something right get some skyrail so it's like five stops on the

01:00:24.19 skyrail so we get up uh Emily and I are both exhausted we just missed the

01:00:28.12 skyrail she's like I'm gonna go sit on that bench and wait for the next one so

01:00:32.02 she goes over and sits on the bench I'm like [ __ ] it I'll go sit next to her I

01:00:35.18 go sit next door too immediately the the

01:00:38.02 thing shows up so we walk over get on it

01:00:40.02 go one stop two stops three stops fourth stop fifth stop we get off I go to get

01:00:45.16 up I go to grab my bag I don't have a bag [Laughter]

01:00:49.17 where the [ __ ] is my backpack oh my god I think I did I leave it on

01:00:53.11 the park bench it's the only thing that makes sense so I look at Emily we have

01:00:57.01 17 minutes for our flight boards I'm like I got to go back I just run out of

01:01:01.09 the sky tram across the hallway to the other one hop on the other one go the

01:01:05.02 five slowest scariest stops back bolt out of that thing my backpack's

01:01:09.11 just sitting there waiting for me completely and totally ignored by

01:01:12.20 everybody else on the airport I cannot believe it I got it back I had my

01:01:17.12 driver's license in it it had my wallet it had all of my money it had my laptop

01:01:21.19 it had my passport it had my phone it had everything in it so where was this

01:01:26.01 like right right by the sky was the sky like right by there or was it like

01:01:29.05 downstairs no upstairs in the sky link I think it's the only thing that saved me

01:01:32.21 is no security or anybody's ever [ __ ]

01:01:34.21 around in the sky link right because nobody's ever in there yeah it's usually

01:01:38.06 you stand so there's nobody there's never a chance

01:01:40.18 for people to mill around and notice it so I think that was the only thing that

01:01:44.08 saved it and but uh yeah it was like to me like maybe 1012 minutes to get back

01:01:48.04 and it was there and that's the end of my vacation I'm blown away that was

01:01:53.01 still there a bat and a loose backpacking airport doesn't last long no

01:01:56.18 no it does not but the gods were smiling on me

01:02:01.09 the joy of your vacation wasn't the events that happened it's the things

01:02:05.23 that didn't and the tragedy of the other experiences that's the only choice

01:02:09.16 outside of manhance that sounds like it was a great time but beyond that you're

01:02:15.07 just avoiding tragedy or is the highlight of your vacation oh I never

01:02:19.02 want to go anywhere with you oh yeah I I don't blame you I don't blame you how

01:02:24.05 the [ __ ] did that happen dude how did I

01:02:27.09 get an out I have 50 miles in the ocean on a tiny little like gilligan's island

01:02:33.02 like the skipper's boat and gilligan's island is massive compared to this dinky

01:02:36.21 little thing we were on and we were out there for [ __ ] floating around for

01:02:40.09 like seven hours when it was all said and done it's a

01:02:43.19 terrifying experience I've been out on a pretty small boat you know far enough

01:02:47.08 away that you can't see any land where like your phone's not working there's no

01:02:53.05 signal it is uh it's scary because you realize

01:02:55.05 not a lot of stuff has to go wrong and you're in serious like life-threatening

01:03:00.17 trouble yeah one one thing has to go wrong a hole that's it

01:03:07.05 how how long would you have had to have spent out there for you to eat the ham

01:03:13.01 and mayo I don't think I could have ever eaten again I I was

01:03:16.21 I have never experienced nausea like that and I and I'm not a knock I realize

01:03:21.12 I just got nauseous on roller coasters like three weeks ago in Florida or a

01:03:24.11 month in Florida but that had way more to do with like particular stresses in

01:03:28.10 my life and the trip than the roller coaster I think uh but I have I have

01:03:33.20 I wouldn't say I have like an iron stomach by any means but I don't get

01:03:38.21 nauseous I don't get seasick and I have never in my life experienced

01:03:43.16 discomfort like that I would do just about anything to never feel that way oh

01:03:49.01 amazing absolutely amazing so real relaxing

01:03:52.06 vacation came back totally recharged and ready to re-tackle life

01:03:58.04 I would have said based on our last recordings that you needed the vacation
