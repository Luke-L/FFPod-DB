00:00:00.00 Foreign.

00:00:07.22 [Music]

00:00:23.17 Correct me if I'm wrong uh but this is episode 126 and to my knowledge this is

00:00:30.00 the first episode of season five that's correct I think last episode should have

00:00:35.07 been the first episode of season five oh oh yeah I got season four ended in that

00:00:39.19 episode yeah I thought we I don't know we did it didn't we do another one after

00:00:43.16 the last one oh you're right hold on a second

00:00:46.11 welcome to another episode of the F**kFuckFacePodcast I believe this is episode 126

00:00:51.00 and correct me if I'm wrong boys but this is the second episode of season

00:00:55.19 five sounds right to me Geoff that's exactly correct

00:00:58.21 you're smart oh you guys are sweet thanks so I know how much you love it

00:01:02.10 when I number and categorize things so I

00:01:04.13 wanted to be sure I got it right for you can I talk about a thing that I'm

00:01:07.15 annoyed about irrationally but I am annoyed about it okay Gavin remember to

00:01:12.07 you too so oh really what did I do that's gonna be fun let's find out what

00:01:17.01 Gavin annoyed okay I'm annoyed because Gavin messaged our Discord saying his

00:01:22.12 computer won't turn on slight problem seem like a big deal you still [ __ ]

00:01:26.01 showed up on time you're annoying I hate it I hate that even with your Tech

00:01:29.18 issues you're still on time I wish I hadn't warned you guys and I would have

00:01:33.07 just shown up on time with you know with enough but I was getting a bit freaked

00:01:36.09 out what do you think the chances are Andrew Gavin this is not for you this is

00:01:40.15 just purely for Andrew so you can sit quietly uh Andrew what do you think the

00:01:46.05 chances are here that Gavin invented a computer problem that he then instantly

00:01:51.17 fixed to show up on time just to make himself look better so that he may

00:01:56.21 lessen the time uh that he it's going to

00:01:59.14 take him to get back to being an on-time guy no I think that's a genius Point by

00:02:03.20 you that I completely agree he's been late a lot recently so this is a perfect

00:02:08.11 example of maybe him setting up a scenario which he could still despite

00:02:12.05 the barriers thrown in his way appear on time let me be honest with you about

00:02:15.15 eight minutes into my computer not turning on I did figure out why I wasn't

00:02:20.14 turning on really I have a Blu-ray Drive that if it's on

00:02:24.10 when when I turn the computer on it tries to boot from a disc and I didn't

00:02:28.03 hear the fact that it was going like and as soon as I turned that off the

00:02:32.20 computer came on but I didn't yeah yeah it still took nine minutes to turn on

00:02:39.07 so in essence Andrew and I were right I would say

00:02:41.20 subconsciously you're right okay there's another one I'll take that that's fine

00:02:46.18 you're talking about that annoyance I have a thing that's been driving me

00:02:51.09 crazy in my bedroom where when I turn my

00:02:54.06 TV off uh with the Apple remote which is all I use because it's got an Apple TV

00:02:58.09 connected to it the TV turns off and then anywhere between 20 and 45 seconds

00:03:02.05 later it is random it will just turn back on again and then I have to turn it

00:03:07.01 off a second time but it happens 100 of the time the TV in the bedroom is

00:03:12.05 a two turn off TV I don't know why or how it started all at once in the middle

00:03:17.00 of like it's been there it's been on that wall working fine for I don't know

00:03:20.13 six months a year however long since I hung it and the [ __ ] just maybe

00:03:25.03 like three weeks ago just decided nah I'm gonna to turn off TV now and it's it

00:03:28.20 says it that the Apple TV has already slept and when you're hitting it you're

00:03:32.06 turning off the TV but you're actually turning the Apple TV on no because I I'm

00:03:36.11 doing it like from an app like for like I'm watching an episode I'm like like

00:03:39.19 watching Sports Center via the Apple TV it's all operating and I'm just like

00:03:45.09 this no idea my behavior hasn't changed at all only the TV's Behavior

00:03:50.13 oh uh anyway so what we annoyed Andrew about oh uh well you know uh there's a

00:03:55.21 photo uh you know we just had the highly successful

00:03:59.09 uh I would say highly successful alphabet and everybody seemed to love it

00:04:05.02 uh this is one of the photos uh that uh Andrew posted showing his desk as we all

00:04:11.21 know uh Gavin and I love to pour over Andrew so any any image we can get of.

00:04:17.23 Andrew's apartment or or her home or secret place you live uh so that we can

00:04:24.01 find any like inkling of of uh like a secret data about the the bizarre way

00:04:30.01 you live your life and uh so I was looking over that picture with a fine

00:04:33.11 tooth comb because there's so much to look at and that's what I noticed and

00:04:37.11 then apparently every remember on the site notice as well you

00:04:41.20 have a thousand [ __ ] pencils on your desk what kind of what kind of like

00:04:47.03 power mover you pulling on us here even like literally Mr anti-pencil has a Nix

00:04:52.16 Nick nailed it a treasure Trove of pencils and then I got to thinking not

00:04:57.11 only are you flaunting these pencils just right in our face you put them in a

00:05:01.11 port a potty which was a a torture device of your design directed at me so I feel

00:05:07.05 like it's like a double [ __ ] you coming we both saw this as a multi-layered

00:05:11.07 power play no no yeah first of all port a

00:05:13.11 potties may be the nicest gift I've ever given anyone there's no attack as part

00:05:17.02 of a port a potty you didn't have a toilet I provided you a toilet I don't

00:05:21.19 see why there's any issue with what I did second of all I've never protested

00:05:26.14 against pencils as a tool to use them you can never have enough pencils who

00:05:32.11 doesn't love a pencil I just uh you know wait it's not gonna admit that that's a

00:05:36.01 pencil yeah it's not why wouldn't it's not a writing utensil that's a that's a

00:05:40.08 pencil well I think you could call that a pencil you can call it all sorts of

00:05:44.07 things interesting yeah where did you get the pencils and why do you have so

00:05:48.22 many where did I get the pencils I bought I bought a thing of uh pencils

00:05:53.21 from Amazon like a giant pack of it and I was gonna do it that was gonna be my

00:05:58.03 episode 100 thing that I decided not to do for some reason I was gonna instigate

00:06:03.23 the audience I was going to make a whole video of like having the pencils

00:06:09.10 grinding them down getting ready to like make them into a pancake like cooking a

00:06:12.23 pancake for it and then going like nah and then just eating some hot cakes from.

00:06:17.11 McDonald's using my great hack and then I was gonna film a video of me walking

00:06:21.13 the pencils to the garbage and just throwing them in there and I never did

00:06:25.07 that so instead I just put them in my port a potty mug and they're they're

00:06:29.02 there were you worried about the backlash of such an act I don't remember

00:06:33.09 there was something that happened at that time that I just was like you know

00:06:36.19 what I I don't I think maybe it was the fact that episode 100 felt like it was

00:06:41.05 going to be a fun thing that we're celebrating I was like I maybe don't

00:06:44.12 want to try to annoy everybody I can't remember what you did for episode 100. I

00:06:49.02 didn't do anything I had every I had all these things planned and I didn't

00:06:52.21 ultimately do any of them because they would either uh be against Geoff which

00:06:57.06 was not a great idea at the time or uh it would instigate the audience which I

00:07:01.04 didn't want to do because I wanted 100

00:07:03.10 to be like a fun thing interesting yeah interesting okay and

00:07:07.16 plus I'm kind of glad I didn't because nothing could top with Geoff did he stole

00:07:12.13 the show this is a great thing you did the tattoos the tattoos all right I did

00:07:16.18 I was racking my [ __ ] brain trying to remember what I did on episode 100. You

00:07:22.05 looking like a mermaid getting getting tattoos on you it's fantastic completely

00:07:26.15 forgot I did that oh man do you have a do you own a pencil sharpener

00:07:31.15 oh yeah I do I bought one at the same time I have an electric pencil sharpener

00:07:35.11 I was gonna use that to grind them down I think instead of grinding those things

00:07:39.23 down I think you should use each and every pencil to its like use it down to

00:07:45.04 the nub and then as soon as you finish one uh grab the next one and try to make

00:07:49.22 it your life's goal to draw out all of those pencils I like that idea a lot I

00:07:54.17 think I'm gonna I'm gonna do that they're gonna get a lot of use for uh

00:07:58.18 something related to MVP coming up so maybe I'll knock one or two of them out

00:08:04.03 how long does it take how many how many strokes is in a pencil

00:08:07.18 how many strokes yeah before I use the question

00:08:11.13 um let me Google that yeah like how far does a pencil like will a pencil go a

00:08:15.14 mile like how many licks to the center of a Tootsie Pop have we done that

00:08:20.01 research for pencils like how many strokes is the average pencil uh

00:08:25.14 uh oh Lord uh it's been established that the average pencil has enough graphite

00:08:31.12 to write about 45

00:08:34.03 000 words I could do two lists plus some

00:08:37.20 maybe if you're actually writing the list with a pencil you wouldn't have as

00:08:42.23 many repeats no I would just I would have probably more because I couldn't

00:08:46.23 easily search it and I'd just be more miserable I think I think as a test

00:08:52.12 nobody could read my list I did it by hand

00:08:55.11 do you have Batman writing oh the worst terrible you think my drawing is bad oh

00:09:01.02 my God Jesus Christ I I wonder if you as a test just wrote

00:09:05.05 the word word 45000 times with that pencil uh see if it like see how close

00:09:10.05 you are to finishing it yeah it's kind of like uh it's kind of like every

00:09:15.09 punishment I had in school actually yeah like the Bart Simpson yeah chalkboard

00:09:19.23 yeah yeah maybe I'll try that maybe next time we record I'll have a sheet

00:09:24.16 probably not I'm probably not gonna do that but I like it yeah have I told you

00:09:29.08 guys that since when the last couple of well maybe like six weeks I've had two

00:09:35.02 major anxiety dreams about missing dinners really because of your lateness

00:09:41.05 yeah like I keep fascinating it's because I felt it like I felt Geoff's

00:09:46.22 text in in the Home Depot and I just thought ah like oh I'm so screwed and

00:09:51.14 that feeling has has not yet left me and I I just get that anxious feeling and

00:09:56.15 I've woken up from that twice since is your greatest fear gonna be when

00:10:01.12 those dreams feel normal to you when you've truly become a man of lateness

00:10:07.01 yeah they're no longer anxiety feelings off in my dream I think that's difficult

00:10:11.15 don't worry as soon as you're able to do that there'll be an Edgar Wright Dream

00:10:16.09 waiting in the winter oh man dude I

00:10:21.16 the great content for the podcast I always like I said at the time I almost

00:10:26.14 preferred it that way yeah because I've had dinner with you a million times

00:10:30.00 we'll have dinner a million more times it was more memorable than the dinner we

00:10:31.21 probably would have had yeah I I tell you I guarantee you you go to that

00:10:35.19 dinner you you and Meg show up I can't tell you one thing about that night

00:10:38.19 today completely unremarkable I'm sure we have

00:10:42.12 a lovely time but it fades into the it fades in amongst the other 10000 double

00:10:47.10 dates and dinners that we've had together uh but I I don't know how to

00:10:52.12 tell you Andrew I I this is how Pro Gavin I am these days how I just how

00:10:57.04 much I love all of you guys now I'm just so full of love right now I was at work

00:11:01.12 yesterday to do another podcast right and in that podcast somebody mentioned

00:11:06.02 uh stay away from H they're doing lasso so they're probably pretty uh it's

00:11:09.09 pretty intense and smelly in there and as soon as I heard their plan lasso I

00:11:13.05 thought well Gavin's got to be involved in that I ran over everybody said hi to

00:11:17.08 me I Joe Michael everybody I I think maybe Alfredo I ignored them all I ran

00:11:21.14 over to give Gavin a hug and a big kiss on his head and I didn't even think

00:11:24.22 about it I just kissed him on his head and then I was walking away again he

00:11:28.02 goes I got a kiss and I was like I kissed him I'm just so excited to see

00:11:31.19 him you came in and we were like hey and then I you kissed my forehead and I was

00:11:36.12 like oh I got a kiss and then you're gone and then we beat the level yeah good

00:11:42.15 luck should we talk about lasso a different lasso that occurred because

00:11:46.13 that that brought me a lot of Joy last week I didn't even think about bringing

00:11:49.15 it up in this context but you say it made me think what you're talking about

00:11:53.14 you don't know what you're a key part of this so a very long time ago Gavin and

00:11:58.19 his friend Dan tried to get the Halo 2.

00:12:01.10 Lassa I don't know if you want to cue up the photos because they're fantastic

00:12:05.04 they tried to get the Halo 2 lasso achievement which is to complete every

00:12:08.14 level of Halo 2 and lasso in the play list now they did it in Co-op

00:12:11.16 there's a weird issue with Halo 2 where there is one Mission at the start that

00:12:15.19 you have to do in single player they will not let you do in Co-op so they

00:12:19.08 went through the entire game and the achievement never popped and they

00:12:22.22 realized it's because they didn't do this one level and you can't just like

00:12:26.09 go do it later like you have to do it in the correct sequence

00:12:30.14 yeah I have a photo of the moment we discover this popping it in now

00:12:35.21 that is a picture of Dan puzzled at why he didn't get the achievements

00:12:40.22 so because that happened this is you before we did face I felt bad for Gavin

00:12:44.17 so this is 2019. This is something that I've kind of considered doing myself

00:12:48.17 this will be motivation I'll do it with one of my friends we'll get to the end

00:12:53.09 and then I'll let Gavin know hey I have two checkpoints you can do it with one

00:12:57.12 of us and Dan could do with the other person it's gonna be great I think we

00:13:01.15 talked about do we talk about the intricacies of why didn't work yeah I

00:13:05.21 just explained it I believe okay about all we had to do was then play the first

00:13:10.21 cut scene in first level and then beat the play list again but but you can't

00:13:14.15 start from the end of the play list you have to start and play the entire game

00:13:18.09 again but all you really need is for the game to see you click over the final

00:13:24.09 boss in the final level all the other levels complete yeah so I with a friend

00:13:30.00 go through Halo 2 lasso get to the last one reach out to Gavin we recorded Nate

00:13:34.17 it takes us a few hours but we do it we complete Halo 2 lasso we both get the

00:13:39.06 achievement now it's just my friend and Dan need to sync up somehow they don't

00:13:43.22 they have no connection it seems very unlikely to me that this will ever

00:13:49.02 happen but I think like two months after yeah so we're 2019. Yeah last week

00:13:53.23 because gav and I had talked about it sort of recently how it's funny that my

00:13:57.06 friend still has that checkpoint and has never gotten the achievement and danced

00:14:00.17 still also hasn't gotten it Gavin texted me what days are your is your friend

00:14:05.14 available like in the next five days does your friend have an availability

00:14:09.16 well first I was like does he still have

00:14:11.20 that checkpoint because I thought that's the chances that this checkpoint would

00:14:16.22 have held for three years now let me explain the joy that I I got when I

00:14:21.19 received that message that friend and I love them they're terrible at Halo

00:14:27.22 they spent most of that experience not playing well I dragged us through level

00:14:31.10 by level they're awful they uh they're the person that they they are the person

00:14:37.04 that I did the applesauce racist with where I wasn't eating the applesauce

00:14:40.16 they would just Chow it down they are they're an idiot and I love them they're

00:14:44.15 terrible at Halo too they're fantastic um so when I saw that text I thought oh

00:14:50.01 this is my friend the applesauce guy he's so bad at this this is gonna be a

00:14:55.03 disaster I'm so excited I rushed over to

00:14:58.15 message him hey what's your availability for the next five days

00:15:01.13 and we sorted it out we got it organized it was like Monday whatever it doesn't

00:15:05.07 really matter but we but they found a time and for the next that was like two

00:15:08.20 days in the future they're gonna do it there were moments throughout those next

00:15:12.19 two days where I would just light up enjoy knowing the pain that that they

00:15:18.06 would be going through this is terrible at Halo and Dan was excited to finally

00:15:23.12 get closure on this achievement that he put in probably

00:15:27.01 40 hours into maybe easily yeah I'll let you take it from here Gavin because I

00:15:31.11 sadly was not able to watch these runs tell me what was the experience like

00:15:36.03 watching the play I realized very quickly that this person was no good at Halo

00:15:41.14 because because iron is on it just means that when when

00:15:46.18 your friend died they both got reset and I just never hear this side of Dan but

00:15:53.17 Dan was like oh don't worry about it no we've got he was someone like being

00:15:58.19 actually motivational

00:16:02.13 when they go ahead I just I was just gonna say my friend

00:16:08.21 has weird that was the weirdest awkward that was the worst talk over we've ever

00:16:15.04 had in the Hood by far I mean like I want to note it to cut it out but Jesus

00:16:20.03 Christ what happened that was like that's so funny one thing that's great

00:16:23.23 about this podcast is we very rarely ever have those moments and whereas

00:16:27.12 every other podcast I've ever done remotely they're constant but man I've

00:16:32.17 stepped in that hard yeah the problem is that was there was

00:16:36.00 too much respect there there was too much kindness we both wanted to give the

00:16:39.23 right away we both were committed to yeah it was it was that was the issue I

00:16:43.11 was just I don't even remember what I was gonna oh they have no patience they

00:16:46.20 die all the time they just run out and die they're really bad at just waiting

00:16:50.07 so that was one bit where they tried probably 25 times to make it they're

00:16:54.15 basically trying to skip a segment with tons of enemies and Dan made it like he

00:16:58.21 performed this jump that you've been trying so many times and and it was like

00:17:03.23 oh we got it we got it oh okay okay don't die don't die we've got this and

00:17:07.23 they slowly edged through the rest of the level very meticulously taking out.

00:17:12.14 Jackal snipers and all this stuff and I just hear Dan going oh

00:17:16.15 no don't worry don't we could do it your friend is clearly

00:17:23.17 there you go they get all the way to the end all they have to do

00:17:29.04 is do the glitch with Johnson if you've done lasso you you've probably cloned

00:17:34.05 Johnson a few times because it's pretty much impossible to beat the game without

00:17:39.13 doing this exploit where you have to drop a specter into the final boss room

00:17:43.08 at perfect time they get all the way to that point and Dan messes up the Specter

00:17:48.11 part so they drop into the final boss without the Specter which means you

00:17:52.22 can't clone Johnson they have to restart the entire level again

00:17:57.17 this is they're hours in at this point they go through the entire level again

00:18:04.05 they do it they do the glitch they pull it off hold on my shit's too powerful.

00:18:10.12 I will say that's one of the things why don't we get this freaking uh Nitro or

00:18:15.17 whatever what made me so excited was because when Gavin and I did it the

00:18:19.15 glitch to get Johnson in to like bring the the Specter into the room is kind of

00:18:23.11 difficult if you're not experienced with it it took us I want to say three

00:18:27.07 attempts so we had to go through the level three times at that point I was

00:18:30.17 like oh they're gonna definitely [ __ ] up that Specter glitch this is gonna be

00:18:33.23 great they're gonna have to do it multiple times it's gonna be a massive

00:18:37.01 headache what are you doing put an image in that was 270 kilohertz I've put an

00:18:42.13 image in slack okay [Laughter]

00:18:48.08 it's the same image it's the same image three years apart oh my God he didn't

00:18:55.22 get the achievement I guess at some point in the interim time Dan somehow

00:19:02.04 lost all of his progress in the lasso play list like all of his mid progress

00:19:07.23 for any play list was reset so he now has the first cut scene complete the second

00:19:13.09 level Armory and the final level and everything else in the middle is missing

00:19:19.10 and the best part about it is that your friend got the achievement

00:19:24.12 all that happened all that happened is Dan helped Andrew's friend get an

00:19:29.17 achievement for three hours and he walks away from the whole thing

00:19:37.11 he doesn't care about that achievement at all that means nothing to him

00:19:42.17 that's so good apparently the guy was like oh thanks yeah I appreciate it yeah

00:19:48.09 oh man he has one of the hardest achievements in the entire game that is

00:19:53.10 now pretty much played the whole game and the final level twice still has

00:19:58.08 nothing to show for it I think arguably the best part and I correct me from

00:20:02.19 rocking this Gavin even if Dad finishes on the levels he still doesn't have

00:20:06.11 credit for because of that glitch he still would then need to beat the final

00:20:10.04 level again for at the pump so you'd have to beat it three can't get that

00:20:14.02 achievement without playing that level for a third time we couldn't believe it

00:20:18.04 I was just in tears he was sitting in front of the TV and the exact same post

00:20:23.05 trying to figure out what went wrong again did you recognize instantly that

00:20:27.06 it was the same photo

00:20:29.19 well it's a screens hot from a video and I remember I've taken the same video

00:20:35.05 twice I was like it seems really familiar so are is he gonna try again in

00:20:39.16 three years I think so uh I I'm always feeling

00:20:42.22 guilty enough to the point where I'll go

00:20:45.05 through it with him again I feel like he really deserves it at this point it's

00:20:48.10 pretty and that's pretty unfortunate yeah

00:20:51.19 oh man it's the worst laughter too but aside from like Halo 5 it's pretty bad

00:20:57.01 it's terrible how is Halo 5 lasso going oh awful absolutely horrendous what

00:21:04.09 makes you say that I mean we put out a video the other day that

00:21:10.13 was three hours and 40 minutes long we didn't even do the level

00:21:15.05 we just got stuck and stopped what level are you on right now how far

00:21:20.07 into it are you which is street level four

00:21:22.15 oh there's like how many 12 or 13 levels there's 12 playable oh yeah I thought

00:21:27.14 they were 10. Wow you're not even halfway that's great no

00:21:31.06 there's not even an achievement for it or anything that's fit nope there's no

00:21:34.13 reason at all I know they said they wouldn't do it nothing would make me

00:21:37.11 happier if they had Halo 5 to the Master Chief Collection with Alaska

00:21:42.20 right when you're about to finish that achievement list you've

00:21:47.19 698 they drop a Halo 5 lasso into the mix Eric can I get um shitty Discord to

00:21:53.05 let me put up bigger files yep I'll uh I'm I'm getting it right now I just feel

00:21:58.15 like two years in we we deserve it right

00:22:02.02 right I just said that we were gonna do it but we can keep having the

00:22:05.09 conversation on the episode if you want Eric I love sorry for providing a little

00:22:09.04 bit of extra if I were if I were in the room with you

00:22:11.23 right now I'd catch you on the forehead hurt thank you so much I'm I'm already

00:22:14.23 I'm already getting it I'm getting the card I'm I was getting I was going to do

00:22:19.06 it here's the thing I was gonna do it during the episode and then I thought

00:22:23.04 I don't trust Discord at all to not drop everything and make that be a big thing

00:22:28.01 in the middle of the recording by doing whatever this Nitro boost is so I'm

00:22:32.15 waiting until we're done and then I'll take care of it and then we should have

00:22:36.09 it for the year I because I nothing makes me feel more more like a chump

00:22:40.08 then think in an image will land and then I just get like an Fu

00:22:45.13 no no I understand I totally I completely agree with you I hate here's

00:22:50.12 the thing I hate Discord I genuinely think out of every VolP Solution that's

00:22:55.11 ever been a thing on the internet Discord is the [ __ ] dirt worst I hate

00:23:01.18 I hate I am everyday just hanging on to life because I'm trying to outlive.

00:23:07.00 Discord I hate it so much I hate I hate Discord passionately I think it's just

00:23:16.19 the bottom of the barrel but because it's purple and gray everyone gets

00:23:22.11 strict into thinking it's a cool little thing I hate it I hate it so much

00:23:32.20 say uh at some point today I think everybody needs to start being nice to

00:23:37.13 Eric because I'm getting the sense that he's on edge and he might crack soon.

00:23:43.11 Eric's burned out I don't know why because the goddamn San Diego Goose

00:23:47.23 [ __ ] showed up last night and cursed the Dodgers and I love the goose Padres

00:23:52.18 won the goose have you guys seen the goose I'm a big fan of the goose no no a

00:23:57.12 [ __ ] police showed up in the in the so the baseball playoffs are right now

00:24:01.15 it's Eric's team the San Diego Dodgers against what the [ __ ] you said sorry.

00:24:06.12 Eric's team the San Diego Padres against the Los Angeles Dodgers I'm obviously

00:24:10.02 rooting for the Dodgers and in like the fifth or sixth inning a goose just

00:24:13.15 showed up in the like right behind second base and just parked and wouldn't

00:24:17.20 leave and they played for a while which I thought was wild they I think they let

00:24:22.04 Gavin Lux hit while that goose was sitting there and then they went to a

00:24:26.09 commercial break and the goose was gone I'm a big fan of everyone photo shopping

00:24:31.12 hats on the goose great uh I'm I just I think the goose is really fantastic tops

00:24:37.01 now Geoff do you know about the tops card no tops now has released I'm gonna link

00:24:42.12 to a tweet here uh sorry this is a real sort of side tangent for like the rest

00:24:47.10 of this episode for 24 hours there is a digital Goose card the tops has released

00:24:56.23 that's what I'm saying I think it's a good idea we should this goose is pretty

00:25:02.02 cool I'm a big fan um mostly I'm on edge just because of

00:25:06.10 the baseballs uh in general not baseball

00:25:09.09 the sport but baseball's the yeah that's why you're on edge yeah it has a lot to

00:25:15.08 do with that so you know we we had a bunch of people show up to buy it we

00:25:20.07 only had a couple hundred to sell uh unfortunately uh we oversold by six I

00:25:25.19 think is the number so six people six people bought baseballs and then got

00:25:29.14 like a refund because I don't know because no system is perfect and there

00:25:33.09 was a glitch or whatever maybe who knows maybe they bought it at the same

00:25:36.09 microsecond or something but uh so when we when we recognized that I asked Eric

00:25:40.03 to get in touch with those people which he did and I appreciate and we're just

00:25:43.10 gonna hit six balls and then we'll just mail them free balls so not only did

00:25:46.14 they get a refund but they'll get the ball yeah we're doing them good Gavin

00:25:50.23 we've made good now we're making good we're gonna make make good it's crazy

00:25:55.08 that it didn't all work out like you said it would I I mean it did because

00:25:59.09 they oversold and got refunded and everything went up on time and I don't

00:26:03.23 know what else to [ __ ] do well I do know what else to do because when The.

00:26:07.09 Baseballs come out I've already told Geoff I don't have anything to do with

00:26:10.15 them like I'll hit him and I'll I'll get them to the of people who need them I'm

00:26:15.03 done with it at that point everyone else can do baseballs

00:26:19.12 I was afraid I was afraid Eric was gonna quit that day he was

00:26:22.10 I was I was doing a lot of like really nice talking to Eric about what a good

00:26:26.05 job he does as a producer a lot of like I was doing a lot of like talking off

00:26:29.16 ledge conversations I was surprised the refund even took place like how does

00:26:32.19 that surely we could have just gone and hit six more quickly without it being a

00:26:38.01 thing right but that's what happens when

00:26:41.02 we have uh other departments uh that are

00:26:44.08 just sort of doing just yeah I mean just

00:26:47.04 talk to us we're here exactly but that's

00:26:49.11 okay that's how to sort it out because I worked with them I've contacted the

00:26:52.16 people we're hitting six more baseballs and that just means we have to go hit

00:26:55.21 more baseballs again soon but first we have to shoot more does it do and do a

00:26:59.20 monkey movie um don't worry there's a list I uh and

00:27:03.04 speaking of which there's also I I gotta say you know I was telling you guys I

00:27:07.03 think my finger might be broken I don't know if I told you that or not I'm

00:27:10.23 pretty sure my finger is broken so it's gonna be be hard for me to hit baseballs

00:27:15.20 but I'm gonna do it anyway from The Baseballs it broke no no I picked up

00:27:20.21 some groceries and my fingers oh I did a

00:27:23.06 weird position yeah and I thought it was fine I thought I just like pulled a

00:27:26.21 muscle or something but this week it started to to just like like hurt in

00:27:30.22 like a searingly blinding way so I'm gonna deal with that I'm gonna deal with

00:27:35.05 that next week but you know I'll just like I'll I just won't be able to swing

00:27:38.16 for the fences but I'm sure I can still hit

00:27:43.05 tired of getting older I'm tired of my body breaking down my am I sprained

00:27:48.03 ankle from the bike rack you know I thought my knee was worse my ankle still

00:27:53.20 hurts and if anything it hurts more now uh how's the rash

00:27:57.18 uh uh I mean I I think it's no I was hoping it would just be gone I was

00:28:02.17 hoping to be win for you I'm still taking medicine for it

00:28:06.09 um the infected area is still discolored but I was told that that could last up

00:28:11.11 to like a year crotch I have like a stained thigh yeah

00:28:15.13 so I'm still putting medicine on it but it doesn't itch or anything it hasn't

00:28:19.12 itched in probably a month it's just I'm just crawling through with the medicine

00:28:22.14 so I guess it's fine other than if you look at it you go like oh my God you

00:28:26.10 have a giant birthmark right there the birthed on you when you were 47.

00:30:03.12 that's hellotushy.com face for 10 off growing up I had plenty of people in my

00:30:09.03 family who went through the process of quitting cigarettes and

00:30:13.13 through my experiences and talking with them I kind of have an understanding of

00:30:17.18 what that process is like um so if you're a current smoker who's

00:30:21.22 maybe going through the process of quitting or somebody who has quit

00:30:25.08 smoking but could be struggling with not going back to that addiction I

00:30:29.14 understand how difficult that is and that's why you've got to check out fume

00:30:33.12 fume is the natural inhaler designed for a better safer and natural way to quit

00:30:37.21 cigarettes it's a no smoke no vape and no nicotine replacement for the hand and

00:31:14.02 got thousands of five-star reviews from smokers who have tried everything else

00:33:40.12 h-e-I-p.com slash face I have a question for Andrew okay what's

00:33:48.13 up I assume your ankles have been a 100

00:33:52.13 for your allotted six weeks that you wanted right no moving on

00:34:01.05 no no they're not what you mean no I had I slept maybe an hour at a time last

00:34:08.20 night because I was dealing with an ankle issue

00:34:13.14 terrible I get I'm so tired your life is a constant cyclical Loop you have two

00:34:19.11 months of ankles you're back on you break a chair it get a new one we're

00:34:23.18 figuring out the I'm narrowing it down though where we're getting to the bottom

00:34:28.23 of it it's uh what do you mean get to the bottom of what

00:34:31.16 um down to the ankle I'm narrowing it down I'm figuring out what the issues

00:34:36.00 are we're getting through it the last issue is you have shitty ankles oh there

00:34:40.10 there's multiple issues I have shitty ankles and then I have other things

00:34:43.09 going on too but I'm thinking we're getting through it we're figuring it out

00:34:46.21 so yeah I I I stepped on a landmine essentially accidentally and I couldn't

00:34:51.17 the only way I could wasn't in excruciating pain was was if I had my

00:34:56.20 foot flat which is not easy to sleep having your leg up in your foot flat so

00:35:01.13 I tried to sleep then it would hurt then I'd sit up and I'd try to sleep sitting

00:35:05.17 up on my bed that wouldn't really work I'd get like maybe 20 minutes lay back

00:35:09.23 down for 15 until it got bad it was just up and down all night terrible thing I

00:35:15.09 okay follow-up question did the percentage drop below 100 due to

00:35:19.22 something that happened in your own bedroom no

00:35:24.02 well no no okay but we're getting there we're figuring out it didn't get six

00:35:28.18 weeks probably got like five five is not bad and what so what percentage are you

00:35:32.08 left at now uh right now I'd say uh we're getting

00:35:36.02 better I'd say we're probably like 60

00:35:38.06 like for are we doing damage or health what is the rating so it's just Total.

00:35:43.21 - Health of the ankle like the uh 4040 - right now.

00:35:51.05 Yeah no it was bad on the I would say that I was 20 for most of the evening

00:35:56.02 but we're back up to 40. We're climbing back up again Nick says you need a stim

00:36:01.22 pack I do need a stim pack I'd love a stimpack I will say I had a

00:36:06.07 little bit of a fun moment where I brought an ice pack into bed because

00:36:09.12 I've I've recently become a fan of the ice pack I always rejected it I didn't

00:36:14.16 enjoy it I am now a big ice pack guy has to be

00:36:18.00 the ones that you could that aren't like ice you know like it's the gel you need

00:36:24.01 a gel one not a nice one because my issue with the ice ice pack is they say

00:36:28.23 apply it every 15 minutes on and off 15

00:36:32.08 you did goof go 15 take like 30 go into 15 more that [ __ ] ice melts so

00:36:37.11 quickly it's awkward to put on places it doesn't apply it's just it's terrible

00:36:43.08 but you get a job pack and I have my my little fridge in my room keeps it cold

00:36:47.12 we reset it it's great but I last night put the ice pack in the bed then

00:36:52.18 realized ah the place where I'm really sore I don't think I could really like

00:36:56.17 naturally in a way that wouldn't be excruciating put that limb on that in

00:37:01.11 that area but what do I do with this ice pack now

00:37:04.23 I just got a nice pack and I felt like I

00:37:07.09 made the bed a little bit of a dangerous game because for whatever sleep I get I

00:37:10.14 roll around a little bit I don't want to just let randomly land on Ice that'd be

00:37:14.01 a bad wake up so I felt like I made the bed a little bit dangerous it was kind

00:37:18.11 of it was fun spiced it up a little bit did you have any cold dreams didn't have

00:37:22.18 any cool I'd take any dreams at all I didn't get no drinks I was up and down

00:37:27.16 too much but yeah we're not we're not six weeks

00:37:30.18 what were you gonna ask if I was what was the scenario and which was gonna

00:37:32.15 play out well I was just gonna ask you and then you were gonna reply I'm not

00:37:36.13 doing it I was gonna ask you uh when are you doing the marathon ah okay yeah I'm

00:37:40.18 not doing it still works still go there

00:37:43.16 oh man do you think in your lifetime you will do the marathon yes

00:37:48.19 okay do you think in the lifetime of this podcast you will do the marathon I

00:37:54.04 certainly hope so well as do we did the marathon come from Burger confidence at

00:37:58.07 the time like is that why oh [ __ ] the most ultimate you you seem to be

00:38:03.01 thinking that it's one Marathon I committed to three in a week it was the

00:38:06.17 ultimate moment of burger confidence I was laying down I was like you know I

00:38:11.00 could do three marathons in a week I think I could just do this I think I'd

00:38:15.19 be good at this we haven't done a decent bet in a while with you because they're

00:38:20.15 so outrageous like the Millions

00:38:23.17 what does anyone remember three marathons in a week that's what it was I

00:38:29.20 committed I committed to three not one three I haven't even been able to get

00:38:35.02 you close to doing one third of your challenge yeah you guys keep talking

00:38:40.02 about one three I said I do three what we'll settle for one

00:38:45.09 that's a new level of comfort that's way higher than the 50 Burgers no that's

00:38:51.00 like the injury what if we split the difference and you only have to do like

00:38:54.15 one and a half or two okay well this you wanna know where it came from there's a

00:38:58.23 there's a reason why I thought I could do this I was watching some like random

00:39:03.06 thing on that Eddie Izzard ran like 28

00:39:06.04 in 30 days without training and I was like I could do three in a week Eddie.

00:39:10.19 Izard could do 2830 days not a lot of prep easy I got this then I stood up and

00:39:16.01 my ink I was already dealing with ankles at the time I made this declaration

00:39:20.15 while in bed got up it was a little sore I thought I'd be fine I'll bounce back

00:39:25.03 soon it's it's been an up and down road with the ankle since that moment but

00:39:29.10 yeah it was it's amazing how influential monkeys and Eddie Izzard are on your

00:39:33.19 life and what way uh you learned how to skateboard from a monkey but I learned

00:39:38.14 is a strong word like you've been inspired so much in

00:39:42.15 your life I feel like by well now Eddie Izard but monkey I'm an influenced man

00:39:47.06 yeah because of James Bond I've had many moments everybody's everybody has

00:39:52.11 influences in their life I have a billion it's just interesting to see

00:39:55.19 where yours come from I had someone come up to me uh Jack Super Fan Jack he came

00:40:01.16 up to me at work this week and just yelled how did you let him get away with it

00:40:08.07 it's like Andrew just pivoted the 500

00:40:11.20 000 gamer score bet into some GoldenEye bet and you were just like okay

00:40:16.17 um and I was thinking about it I was like because I was right because I was

00:40:21.03 correct that's why that's why that happened but

00:40:23.23 you could that's actually doable the 500

00:40:26.00 000. I but I think the golden Knight we went over this we don't need to go over

00:40:29.10 this again I don't think it would be that interesting a Content I don't know

00:40:33.00 how I'd make it into a thing and it would just you can make any money out of

00:40:36.01 content yeah but not on purpose just use Eric's credit card no it's not even a

00:40:40.14 cost thing it's just it's not that's there's no I just throw money at it I

00:40:44.09 just do a money thing that's not fun it's I understand what Andrew's saying

00:40:48.18 uh having done a gamer score bet in the past to great success that Andrew

00:40:52.11 actually you participated in now that I think about it

00:40:55.12 um I think you helped me get some Left 4.

00:40:58.00 Dead achievements in that gamer score bet I did uh it is just uh it's just a

00:41:01.11 money it's you you really can't just solve that problem with money he's right

00:41:04.19 it's it doesn't feel like a real bet just because there's too many just

00:41:07.23 thousand points there's so many I had somebody message me a game that you

00:41:12.01 could get like 20000 points in in five minutes oh like I was having people like

00:41:16.13 read that's why I was like oh that this isn't like this seems really doable in a

00:41:20.23 shitty way and if I were if I was going to do this I'd just throw money at it

00:41:25.06 and they're not even that expensive I I mean I remember that being a reason I

00:41:29.01 just I just miss you doing bets I mean I miss you

00:41:32.13 we just did the alphabet we just did he though Geoff did Andrew did I bet you

00:41:39.14 know what that's a good question this this seems like a great was it hard for

00:41:45.05 him to do pizza and pineapple and I pancakes and potato patties what's up

00:41:50.14 the most recent episode pretty good point that released to the public as our

00:41:55.17 discussion around the alphabet the results

00:41:58.18 the controversy around the evidence that I I did not in fact rig the machine to

00:42:04.23 give me a pee I don't know if there are people claiming that I gave Geoff a you

00:42:08.06 on purpose there's no rigging at all but this does seem like a good time to

00:42:14.00 make confession to that episode before you make the

00:42:17.10 confession I just want to say real fast Eric pointed out that a marathon is 55

00:42:21.17 000 steps I bet what do you think you could do faster walk a marathon or write

00:42:26.16 down a pencil write down the pencil he's okay what do

00:42:30.19 you think you could do better uh walk 55

00:42:33.15 000 steps or write 55000 things right 55000 thanks

00:42:38.12 okay and now now admit to cheating well listen cheating is a strong word I'm an

00:42:46.05 honorable man that episode

00:42:51.06 since uh probably Episode 22 of this show whenever I became a judge I don't

00:42:57.04 know you said that with a straight face of it oh I always say with straight face

00:43:02.02 it's the truth it is the truth I'm an honorable man I'm an honorable uh what

00:43:07.01 was honor judge.com I'm an honorable man uh and uh someone in the comics

00:43:13.11 I posted a lot of evidence regarding a lot of things and you know it seems very

00:43:18.19 mixed people some people are on my side some people think I I cheated it this

00:43:23.02 confession has absolutely nothing to do about that

00:43:26.02 because I'm an honorable man I didn't rig the machine at all I'm an innocent

00:43:29.20 man I'm a free man I did not do anything wrong but there is a Reddit post that

00:43:34.08 was fantastic I need to own up to this I don't even know what the consequences

00:43:38.07 are if there are any but uh Reddit user archery contest posted

00:43:42.21 I don't remember the title of the post Andrew has reached the agreement it's

00:43:47.10 the title opened it up in that episode I said all of my support sports teams

00:43:52.22 are trash yes it's an outlawed word that is the

00:43:59.02 trash word I have to use rubbish I have lost the ability to say trash I we need

00:44:04.21 to check the tapes I do not know what the consequences of of making such an

00:44:10.03 error I apologize I hope the audience can how many times do you think he's

00:44:15.06 misused rubbish than trash Oh it probably countless times here's what

00:44:20.06 we're gonna love we're gonna we're gonna count this one we're gonna call it your

00:44:25.06 first strike in language love face you get three strikes and then it's a

00:44:29.18 marathon so you've got one strike if you say trash two more times you've got to

00:44:34.03 walk America I like that okay deal and how long does he have to complete the

00:44:37.20 marathon off to the final strike shut the [ __ ] shut up these guys as long as

00:44:42.20 it takes as long as it takes me to write forty five thousand as long as it takes

00:44:48.09 me to write rubbers 45000 times with a pencil okay I'll accept those terms

00:44:53.13 right with pencil a pencil right right like not not digital we're talking about

00:44:59.02 physical okay I'm gonna write the 45000

00:45:01.13 words that sounds fair when is the can I get

00:45:05.08 one last one in without getting a strike in like a grace period okay

00:45:10.08 that's rubbish

00:45:12.19 that sounds great that sounds appropriate uh uh that sounds like

00:45:17.04 natural like uh hey should I wanted to deal with this at the top of the hour

00:45:22.21 but then I just realized we're [ __ ]

00:45:26.13 over 42 minutes again somehow uh I was gonna dress this right out of the gate

00:45:31.02 uh but in a somber serious note I feel like we should talk about it

00:45:35.12 um because there have been you know it's

00:45:39.19 it's public knowledge now uh that uh and I'm gonna

00:45:43.21 apologize now if I cry at all I'm gonna try real hard not to but um in the most

00:45:48.17 recent episode that came out of face 124

00:45:51.14 I mentioned that Henry had gone to the hospital and he was okay uh

00:45:55.22 unfortunately he died a couple days later

00:45:58.19 um and he he I always considered Henry to be an official member of face

00:46:04.01 definitely uh I thought he brought a lot a hell of a lot of joy

00:46:09.03 to what we did uh it was really it was really it was a it was it was really sad

00:46:14.11 um he he didn't suffer uh it was it was if there's such a thing as a good death

00:46:19.21 it was a really really good death he he um he died in bed with us uh while we

00:46:26.05 held him and he was happy but uh he didn't he didn't squeak much for the

00:46:32.02 last I don't know six months or so and I just kind of didn't talk about it he

00:46:36.13 just wasn't really able to play much anymore he had some mobility issues but

00:46:42.01 I want the audience to know that until he died uh Henry was still in the room

00:46:46.16 every episode of face he would crawl or walk in he he couldn't play he couldn't

00:46:51.13 make the noise that he used to but he would come and he would sit next to me

00:46:54.17 and he knew every time I was recording his face that it was time to go to work

00:47:00.16 and he without fail until the end he came and he sat here and he went through

00:47:04.09 every episode of face with us uh he he you may not have known he was there but

00:47:10.15 he was and so um Emily and I talked about a lot about like what how to what

00:47:14.13 to do about it um on this and I even you know we even joked around about maybe

00:47:18.10 doing like a one last squeak for him I kept owl and I kept uh well I've kept my

00:47:23.12 favorite toys that he had I kept pussing out loud and uh they're they're on the.

00:47:27.21 Shelf next to me uh but that seems silly and I don't want to do that I do think

00:47:31.01 it's pretty Facey that we are making a squeaky dog toy that he will never score

00:47:35.07 oh it's because it's not it's not gonna come in it's not going to come in until

00:47:38.22 well after his death uh but a lot lot of people have sent well wishes to Emily

00:47:43.06 and uh I uh and me and I just wanted everybody to know that like Henry did

00:47:48.07 pass away but he he was five days short of 12 which is

00:47:52.08 like 104 years old in Bulldog terms and so you know their life expectancy is

00:47:58.13 like eight years and so he made it 50

00:48:01.19 more than that and so uh anyway uh don't

00:48:03.13 want to bring the mood down too much but

00:48:05.15 uh but Henry did pass away last week and so I I thought people should know so he

00:48:10.16 made a solid 125 episodes with us yeah he did he made it 125 episodes the first

00:48:16.15 125 episodes of the Henry episodes I'd love to know how many how much

00:48:21.09 squeaking we have if somebody compiled all the squeaks how long of squeaks

00:48:26.14 would we have like if you just edit off the beginning like how long is this a

00:48:30.18 sustained because we have enough squeak to last what would be an episode length

00:48:34.20 across the time because there were some great squeaks by Henry he has some

00:48:39.03 extended squeaks I feel like we all got used to the squeaks yeah rare occasion

00:48:44.10 squeaks where we all just had to pause while he really squeaked it out and you

00:48:48.11 know what and we should make an album or something that's face just the squeaks

00:48:57.10 like I'm sure Nick can speak to this but.

00:49:00.17 Henry's squeaked a lot more than made it

00:49:03.03 on air because when you guys are talking and Henry's squeaking I think Nick

00:49:06.10 probably just flattens out my audio so you can't you probably can't hear most

00:49:10.11 of the actual squeaks that were going on yeah

00:49:12.19 Henry when Geoff's talking which is why half the time especially in those early

00:49:16.08 days when I wasn't following conversations and I'd be like I'm honest

00:49:19.13 I tuned out it's because the squeaking will be so goddamn loud sometimes I

00:49:23.22 couldn't focus on both I I watched a cut of I think we all saw

00:49:28.23 it today uh regulation animation and it's the go go now story which is so

00:49:34.18 it's it's animated so well it's all really good I turned it up really loud

00:49:38.21 to show my wife I'm like oh hey watch this it's it's pretty funny the

00:49:43.23 squeaking I didn't realize how much squeaking there is in that story Geoff

00:49:48.21 you're talking the whole time and it is constant in the background it is so it

00:49:55.06 is so loud and it's just being animated I was so used to it they're like we'll

00:50:00.01 show it to someone and they're like What's the squeaking oh yeah yeah don't

00:50:04.23 worry about it I like that he's transferred into another medium

00:50:09.17 I'm glad that all those squeaks are captured I

00:50:14.12 squeak I've got a lot of questions about the lore of Henry it is funny it did it

00:50:19.19 like it became a natural thing so quickly that yeah I can't remember when

00:50:25.05 it began it was yeah it was sort of just always there

00:50:29.01 yeah I remember finding out when you told us the names of the toys of owl owl

00:50:35.15 and puss puss and then finding out was is puss puss an octopus yeah of course

00:50:42.17 of course of course puss puss is an octopus I would have assumed platypus I

00:50:48.12 would I mean I see where you're going with octopus I wouldn't be thinking

00:50:53.01 platypus yeah that's true I'm gonna associate

00:50:56.02 that with cat as much but you're not wrong

00:50:59.20 now he's a little blue octopus uh he's a cutie

00:51:02.20 yeah I see he's looking at me right now actually

00:51:07.02 um well if people have any Henry fun facts that we've talked about I'd love

00:51:12.03 to see them yeah he was a good guy he he

00:51:15.20 uh he was a really good guy he really he really took his job on face seriously

00:51:20.02 like it I would try to like on days when

00:51:22.06 I wasn't feeling the squeaks I would try to sneak away from him you know leave

00:51:26.11 him asleep on the bed in the other side of the house in the bedroom and then

00:51:30.19 shut the door which doesn't lock or anything it's just like saloon doors so

00:51:34.08 they just shut and then like try to be quiet and like clockwork that little

00:51:39.02 [ __ ]

00:51:40.04 We'd be like three minutes in and the doors would go bam open and Henry would

00:51:45.00 be here with like a [ __ ] ball in his mouth ready to go he witnessed the whole

00:51:49.06 bean hole he did he was there for all of the beetle too that's right yeah he's

00:51:53.14 watching over it oh wow little cutie um anyway Pizza soon yeah we got it we

00:51:58.13 gotta get on that pizza because Emily is getting uh ready to [ __ ] is that the

00:52:03.17 next uh face office day could it be Pizza

00:52:07.09 yeah the next the next [ __ ] face office Day is next week which day no no

00:52:13.13 Wednesday why are you laughing did you already tell me

00:52:18.21 I sent the invite I don't know how long ago but uh it is Wednesday at 1pm next

00:52:24.09 week no problem

00:52:29.07 I'll see you at one o'clock on Wednesday all right

00:52:32.20 there is yes nothing scarier than hearing Gavin say what day uh-huh

00:52:39.19 did I miss the you know I won't even go there yeah

00:52:45.19 where where no no no no no no no it's okay everything's okay don't worry the

00:52:51.06 only place I'm going is Geoff's house on Wednesday

00:52:56.10 could uh oh you're here Eric where did the goose land what what second base

00:53:02.23 pitcher no it was like in it was in like shallow Outfield I I don't remember uh

00:53:09.00 yeah it was like it was like between first and second base closer to second

00:53:14.10 base maybe uh 15 feet 30 feet behind second place second base yeah yeah so I

00:53:20.02 don't I don't watch a lot of baseball I did watch the Mets Padres series and

00:53:25.08 there was a fantastic Scandal during I think game three yes I want to say yeah

00:53:30.19 correct yeah late in game three there was an accusation that the pitcher had.

00:53:36.01 Vaseline his ears I'm assuming was the substance that that they thought they

00:53:39.22 were accusing and then there were all these close-ups I don't was this is this

00:53:43.02 something that happens regular in baseball because it was a great moment

00:53:46.13 they were zooming in on his his ears and how glisteny they were and there were

00:53:50.23 all these talks about like what's going on with the ears what's going on then he

00:53:54.09 like kind of rubbed his ears and felt like oh is he trying to hide something

00:53:57.08 what's going on with these ears and then like all of the officiating crew got

00:54:00.20 together which is like five or six guys all talking about this other man's ears

00:54:05.14 and then they talked to the team about it and then eventually they rubbed down

00:54:10.01 his ears to check if there was it was a ridiculous scene so I was just curious

00:54:16.04 if maybe Padres upping their game brought Vaseline via the Goosen no as a

00:54:20.07 possibility no that's a great idea to have some kind of goose delivery

00:54:23.23 mechanism to your picture so you can cheat um like nobody would see a big Goose

00:54:28.21 handing something to your picture yeah again maybe it was actually goose fan

00:54:33.23 that was like a hint to it could have been could have been great I think it

00:54:38.18 was I Icy Hot to keep them yeah uncomfortable and focused but they

00:54:43.03 checked him in the sixth inning but the manager for the Mets was suspicious from

00:54:48.17 the very first pitch so he waited for his team to be losing for six Innings to

00:54:52.22 go something's wrong I gotta be honest I watched that entire game too and I was

00:54:57.20 up at Emily's families in Michigan and from the first inning I was on the couch

00:55:02.03 going to Emily going what is wrong with his [ __ ] ears they're glowing they

00:55:06.05 are absolutely the rest of his body is dry and his ears are dripping it is so

00:55:11.01 weird and so then when they they approached him on the sixth inning and I

00:55:13.02 was like oh [ __ ] I guess at least I'm not the only one that thinks these years

00:55:16.13 things are the ear thing is weird however even if it was Vaseline that

00:55:20.21 doesn't help a pitcher pitchers want sticky [ __ ] they want to scuff up a ball

00:55:24.08 they'll just smooth it out uh supposedly

00:55:27.03 it is it is icy hot like Eric was saying and I guess a lot of pitchers do that

00:55:31.01 because it keeps them alert and uncomfortable and so they're like always

00:55:35.05 focused and they're like did you hear about Roger Clemens and Toki yeah no no

00:55:40.06 he got he wasn't feeling it like it was like an opening to a season or whatever

00:55:44.03 and he wasn't really feeling it and they they had sent these teams to Tokyo to

00:55:47.20 kind of like get ready and play and everything and Jake Peavey a Padres

00:55:52.11 pitcher was talking about going with him and Roger Clemens was there and got a

00:55:58.08 full body massage in icy hot his whole body his entire body uh in icy hot to

00:56:03.23 like wake him up and get him uncomfortable and then told Jake Peavey

00:56:09.20 when I'm on the mound I don't like being comfortable because when you're

00:56:15.10 comfortable you make mistakes took a handful of Icy Hot and rubbed it on his

00:56:22.14 dick and balls and it went out bitched so there's a rich tradition of this in

00:56:27.04 major league baseball baseball players are weird but we're all happy about the

00:56:31.23 goose at least oh I'll do that before the next recording oh my God I see hot

00:56:35.23 on icy hot balls dude I I see hot in my balls and Achievement Hunter that day

00:56:39.00 and it was brutal I don't want to do that again but I will because I'm

00:56:42.15 comfortable enough to make a really good episode no I got a great idea why don't

00:56:46.00 excellent why don't we all pick a series

00:56:49.03 of numbers and then I will pull one from the machine and whoever gets pulled has

00:56:55.05 to do it let's put Icy Hot on I can see no issues with this yeah this is a

00:56:59.14 random system in which no way could be influenced or messed with because I am

00:57:04.13 an honorable man you're gonna have a 4K streaming web cam live

00:57:10.08 we just don't do it I'm also open to that it just

00:57:15.13 it just like like you understand that right no yeah no you're right you're not

00:57:20.18 wrong about that well if it was if it was a one in four chance Eric if you're

00:57:24.17 of your name being pulled would you go

00:57:27.20 in on it for the icy hot [ __ ] no I don't

00:57:27.20 think I would because I don't trust it I

00:57:30.20 mean there's no way if it was rigging it that he would pick you

00:57:36.09 I just don't trust that it would I think it's all or nothing I I think the idea

00:57:40.08 is is that uh yeah being agitated will make us operate at a higher level of

00:57:45.08 play I like this idea let's do it so it's like all or nothing I I will say I

00:57:49.14 live the life of the picture supposedly that pitcher whose Name Escapes me uh he

00:57:54.13 was throwing a solid two miles an hour faster than his fastest pitch and two

00:57:58.18 miles an hour faster than his average average and uh supposedly what is it

00:58:03.12 what do they measure like RPMs or something on picture yeah right yeah

00:58:08.05 revolutions per minute spin rate and stuff and then off the charts but but it

00:58:13.10 was all just above his average do you know how an average is formed no no I

00:58:17.06 understand that I understand that I'm just saying I'm not saying the guy

00:58:20.18 cheated I'm saying there were clear benefits to using Icy Hot yeah he's he's

00:58:24.13 fired and you can use icy hot it is not a bad substance for a pitcher so put it

00:58:28.21 all over your dick and balls and go crazy maybe if we Icy Hot our dick and

00:58:34.04 balls our jokes per minute will do you think that if you put Icy Hot on

00:58:39.00 your dick and balls you could throw 80

00:58:41.19 miles an hour maybe I could tell 80 jokes an hour I don't know

00:58:46.01 are we doing there are we locked in next episode next recording I'm in I'm in

00:58:51.04 everybody performance he's got to do it he's Nick

00:58:54.09 Nick are you gonna do it thank God I don't talk.

00:59:00.09 I mean if we're gonna do it we can do it it's just gonna be oh okay let's do it

00:59:06.14 I'll mix this I'll do it if you do oh my god oh okay there we go [ __ ] all

00:59:11.02 right episode 127 is gonna be no it's gonna be icy hot yeah it's gonna be

00:59:16.03 we're gonna halfway above or above our average and we always do am I coming in

00:59:20.06 hot oh no I think we're doing during the okay oh I I agree I think at the top of

00:59:26.05 the episode we apply and that sounds good we'll have like him how do we here's

00:59:31.16 okay I have questions about this then okay um how do we keep each other honest

00:59:38.10 what

00:59:46.12 dude I shoved I shoved then I sickle up my ass during an episode like this is

00:59:52.16 not outside of the realm of things that you would you should be able to believe

00:59:57.01 I would do I've done it on camera in Achievement Hunter Gavin was there like

01:00:00.01 oh you don't have to worry about me yeah

01:00:02.17 and there's no point in faking something like that

01:00:06.14 no I want to be part of this experience I think we'll keep ourselves

01:00:11.03 yeah okay okay I just here's what I'll say if anybody

01:00:15.07 here fakes it and isn't it doesn't go all in they're just gonna have to live

01:00:19.20 with that knowledge for the rest of their lives knowing they didn't fully

01:00:23.20 share in the experience yes and it's definitely not a face move if you don't

01:00:27.18 do it yeah it's also going to be noticeable because they're going to be

01:00:31.12 way less funny than everybody else we're all gonna be on the top of our game

01:00:35.16 what else is going to be engaged and locked in if you're not part of that you

01:00:39.22 get left in the dust so we're promising episode 127 is going to be the funniest

01:00:45.13 episode I guess yeah yeah we are or we're

01:00:49.02 confirming that it does nothing the icy hot doesn't work we're really taking

01:00:54.20 this into the lab here's what we can do research here's what we can do uh uh oh

01:01:01.21 Jesus Christ if it's going poorly and it doesn't feel like the funniest episode

01:01:07.09 no there is a story I told you guys about three weeks ago but between

01:01:12.05 episodes face that I did to myself that I thought was too gross to tell on

01:01:18.03 camera yes and and I think Gavin agreed I know Eric agreed

01:01:22.18 Gavin disagreed and I don't remember Kevin and I both agreed that it was

01:01:28.04 appropriate for that it worked and Eric let's still be let's not get it wrong

01:01:32.20 it's a horrendous story but it is oh it's disgusting and gross that it's yeah

01:01:36.09 Eric was Eric was fully against it but I recommend him maybe we just save that

01:01:40.03 for a live event okay well I'm just gonna say if things are going badly I

01:01:43.16 can break the glass and pull that story out and try in some way to tell it that

01:01:47.15 doesn't make me seem like a monster I would also like to point out that there

01:01:51.09 were a few people a few comment levers who thought it was too far when we all

01:01:54.20 we need to put it and hung our genitals out for about a minute

01:01:59.18 you felt that way okay you're not gonna enjoy next week no no yeah yeah that's

01:02:05.14 so that's true give it best am I doing a patch am I going with the foam

01:02:09.18 roll-on or whatever I have all yeah I assumed I would lather up the hands in

01:02:15.17 in the cream yeah I'm gonna just uh go to town yeah I think I want to patch

01:02:20.20 that area yeah I would not patch it that could be bad

01:02:23.05 I would I would either get the Roll On which seems like a lot just get the

01:02:27.19 cream makes sense let's get the cream I'm just I'm on doordash right now I'm

01:02:32.03 just looking to see what options I have if I wanted well can you leave a note

01:02:36.10 and make sure they know it's for your balls so you can make the funniest

01:02:39.12 episode of a podcast

01:02:41.15 oh and uh do we care about brand like I have I have Tiger Balm I was gonna use.

01:02:47.05 Tiger Balm I think it's stronger than Icy Hot anyway but if you need me to get

01:02:51.16 icy hot brand I see hot I can't I don't I don't think maybe I should have a

01:02:55.11 consistent I just have Tiger Bomb Ultra already here because I [ __ ] basically

01:03:00.06 you you want to put something called Tiger Bomb Ultra yeah it'll be it'll be

01:03:05.11 way worse I think than Icy Hot I feel like we're all about to start doping

01:03:10.02 before the next game like that's how much yeah oh yeah I can get the ointment

01:03:14.07 ultra strength it's got a tiger on it because it's Tiger Bomb all right we'll

01:03:18.17 get the same stuff Tiger Bomb serious serious deal I can't get a Tiger Bomb I

01:03:22.21 guess we're getting Tiger Bomb does this clear legal by the way

01:03:27.17 yeah yeah legal yeah I just asked legal said it's fine they also don't know we

01:03:31.07 exist so it's okay oh great yeah I think the only other thing to discuss before

01:03:37.09 we before we go is uh all the banana wipes done no

01:03:41.06 no absolutely not I still got time I got everything organized what it's so ready

01:03:47.07 to go what percentage is it done is it yeah

01:03:49.07 what what percentage did I see last time does anyone remember what I said I

01:03:52.16 forget that question Andrew have you touched it since the last time we talked

01:03:56.11 like physically touched or like I've done some mental work I've done some

01:04:00.21 I've thought about some transitions it's all up here yeah it's all up here it's

01:04:05.19 all up there I actually I need to reach out to somebody on uh Facebook I I'm

01:04:09.22 getting the sense that we should probably end because we're over an hour

01:04:13.04 uh but I do I also had a piece of news that I I thought I would talk about

01:04:17.08 today but we had such a lovely conversation uh but I did I did uh I did

01:04:22.14 a thing in Michigan and I kind of [ __ ]

01:04:26.02 I did it so it was it was definitely a face in a lot of ways but uh so I don't

01:04:31.05 know if you guys want to cover it next week or if you want to I could bang out

01:04:35.07 the story now but I did propose to my girlfriend and she did eventually say yes

01:04:44.11 face that uh let's just say that are we doing with the teaser is this a teaser

01:04:50.17 okay well I just say like yeah I kind of I kind of [ __ ] up the proposal but in

01:04:55.23 a very new way and I'm very excited to hear that and I'll tell you this too I

01:05:00.00 didn't I'm gonna send you let me send you two photos real fast because my

01:05:03.19 friend Kent pointed this out to me the place where I proposed completely

01:05:07.18 unintentionally and I didn't realize it until I saw the photos uh kind of

01:05:12.16 horrified me actually um uh let me find them I'm sorry I'm

01:05:17.06 vamping while I try to find these photos uh you might recognize it Gavin

01:05:23.01 especially uh well I guess Andrew you would too uh this is

01:05:27.07 where I proposed because I thought it would be really romantic

01:05:32.20 and uh it's this place in Mackinac Island called Arch Rock wow okay and my

01:05:39.07 friend Kent pointed out to me that this is actually where I proposed

01:05:50.20 what I've posted is a picture of this place called Arch Rock in uh in Michigan

01:05:56.10 where I proposed and under it is a screens hot from from Randall glass's

01:06:01.13 warthog jump video which is uh the honestly the inspiration for Rooster.

01:06:06.01 Teeth in our career probably is that we we watched that video Gus and I and we

01:06:10.01 got really excited about Halo physics uh I proposed to my

01:06:14.07 girlfriend in like the real life representation of a level of Halo one

01:06:17.23 and Silent that was not intentional that was like that time I bought a bicycle

01:06:21.19 and then Gavin pointed out that it was the achievement hunter color

01:06:25.10 that video was so iconic that I remember the first thing I thought when I saw

01:06:30.14 that video is how am I watching a video of like an Xbox like it was that early

01:06:36.05 how do you record an Xbox and put it on the internet how does that wild

01:06:40.16 it's still a phenomenal video If you ever get a chance to see it he does a

01:06:43.16 bit where he blows up the warthog it goes really high in the air and then he

01:06:45.10 shoots a rocket predictively into it I

01:06:48.01 thought that was the coolest [ __ ] when I was like 13. Oh yeah Gus and I would

01:06:52.00 just spend Friday nights just in the living room trying to recreate

01:06:54.19 everything he did and that's how and that's how we learned how to get like

01:06:58.06 the tank on the base and all that dumb physics stuff we did in rooster tea in

01:07:02.12 early days red versus blue it was all uh

01:07:04.16 it all came from from Randall's video it was the season one yeah he actually he

01:07:08.15 was the original I don't know not to get off on a rooster teeth tangent but that

01:07:12.01 we liked it so much we became friendly with him uh because it was so kind of

01:07:16.03 inspirational uh and informative that he was a ridge he was the original

01:07:19.05 character or voice actor for the character Vic in Rooster Teeth oh and I

01:07:23.21 keep saying Rooster Teeth in Red versus Blue uh and then I think uh Bernie

01:07:30.03 didn't have enough voices uh and so he took that one

01:07:33.05 Bernie needed to bring their voice yet another character so he uh he took over

01:07:36.23 in season two when was the last time you spoke to Randall glass

01:07:41.20 oh it's probably been a decade how about you never oh really he's nice dude

01:07:46.18 um I mean he was I assume he still is but yeah I would probably even talk to

01:07:50.10 him in a decade I did talk to Bernie the other day though still talk to him

01:07:55.15 anyway we should probably wrap up uh be sure to tune in next week for what

01:08:01.15 promises to be the funniest episode in the history of face yeah

01:08:06.05 it's gonna be so bad should we start posting that on Social Service it's real
