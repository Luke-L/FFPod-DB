00:00:01.01 [Music]

00:00:05.03 Previously on face [Music]

00:00:16.15 no but I'm thinking about like you here with like Freddy krueger or whatever

00:00:21.02 where people are like who invented the character anyway

00:00:25.09 hey Gavin who invented Freddy krueger uh oh I I know this I know this can I

00:00:31.16 answer this I love trivia absolutely I team myself up is it wes craven yep he

00:00:37.01 said I know this I just know I I assume it was him hey Geoff just so you know

00:00:41.03 it's episode 104 and whatever Andrew was

00:00:42.20 gonna say I was just gonna say yes to go ahead whenever you're ready hello and

00:00:48.00 welcome to another episode of the F**kFuckFacePodcast this is number 104

00:00:53.20 season four year two volume one my name is Geoff Ramsey with me as always

00:00:59.14 Gavin free and a mumbling idiot named Andrew why are you talking to yourself

00:01:05.07 in the intro Andrew okay well two things first of all this is the end

00:01:08.17 of year two it's their last episode of year two I realized I didn't hit record

00:01:13.02 I just hit record right now I have not been recording I apologize well because

00:01:18.00 it's talking about a thing that I didn't

00:01:18.00 like part of the show so I missed the my recording did not pick up any of the

00:01:22.23 backup we're talking about Freddy krueger and who invented it I was just

00:01:26.01 curious I thought it was wes craven it was great according to Google in a basic

00:01:30.03 search what's the controversy over Freddy krueger I think it was I don't

00:01:33.20 know if there was controversy for Freddy krueger I remember there was with Jason

00:01:37.12 I think he's just not a very nice bloke you can't be inventing Freddy krueger

00:01:41.18 drama well it's it's in the same kind of

00:01:44.07 mythos Freddy krueger and Jason are sort of the same they've fought each other

00:01:47.15 once like I feel like that's not that's like saying that's like to say

00:01:51.02 me and elon musk are the same dude because we both have twitter I I feel

00:01:55.14 like that's a not at all comparable there was a

00:01:59.09 if you and elon musk were in the same space and you fought each other as part

00:02:03.15 of a giant campaign if you two fought then it would be the same did they ever

00:02:07.16 do Freddy vs preda probably in like a comic book

00:02:11.11 somewhere I just feel like they need to bring the two versus movies and go

00:02:16.21 against each other like the winner of each

00:02:20.10 that's a great I'd be so on board for that I watched all of the Freddy and all

00:02:25.00 of the Jason movies because of Freddy versus Jason I hadn't seen Freddy vs

00:02:29.10 Jason and I thought like I wanna I want all the history of these characters so I

00:02:33.20 watched both films to that point there's like six movies on each side if you

00:02:38.10 compare versus way more than six Jason movies at

00:02:42.00 that point there was at least ten uh I don't think there are

00:02:46.20 maybe I don't know this was a while ago either way

00:02:50.02 if you put Freddy versus Jason against any real life fight it's the most

00:02:54.12 disappointing fight I've ever seen hands down I used to really want to be called

00:03:00.12 Jason as a kid because I thought it was the coolest name because

00:03:04.18 what is it July august September October November

00:03:08.10 it's Jason I was like man Jason's are so lucky because of that.

00:03:17.07 I don't know what you're talking about like the first

00:03:21.03 like if you write the first letter of every month it spells Jason in the

00:03:24.23 middle that is such a classic dumb kid thing to think

00:03:28.23 that's great dude I love that that's insane ah it's too bad there's no

00:03:35.00 g and v n uh months damn goon [Laughter]

00:03:40.04 hey what a what? What do you guys want to talk about

00:03:44.08 today we have quite a few things I feel like should we open up with uh

00:03:48.22 I would like to say on the record that bagels are infinitely better than roller

00:03:52.16 coasters roller coasters not great my opinion I just would like to say that on

00:03:57.00 the record roll yeah jack did a whole thing because we

00:04:00.13 should actually just get in that's a great entry point today yeah we might as

00:04:04.21 well tunnel of love that is known as anal passage um

00:04:07.20 we we are selling a lot of shirts an absurd amount of shirts that I feel

00:04:12.15 like has completely changed the narrative on what this whole bid is we

00:04:17.12 accidentally made the best-selling shirt of the entire year is that right yeah I

00:04:23.09 believe so that is atrocious I think it's the most profitable shirt

00:04:27.00 and we're like right about to cross the most sold I feel genuinely bad about

00:04:31.14 that one yeah I thought we were gonna sell like 20 of those things

00:04:35.22 uh we we have sold hundreds upon hundreds and people keep buying them but

00:04:42.17 well firstly I thought we were treated like it was going to be a limited run

00:04:47.14 like our balls yes but secondly who are these like

00:04:51.14 600 people who want to wear anal passage on the front of their shirt they cut

00:04:55.16 surely you can't wear that one I was talking about this with jack this

00:04:58.12 morning because I had to record anal passage uh two episodes of anal passage

00:05:03.12 so I'm if I'm sitting a little weird if I feel uncomfortable that's why

00:05:08.19 uh and uh I was telling him I I was like

00:05:11.18 the only reason that shirt is even still

00:05:11.18 around I I was gonna pull it down Monday or Tuesday as soon as the episode came

00:05:17.01 out uh and they're like all right well it's

00:05:19.08 time to take it down now we sold you know 100 of them or whatever the joke is

00:05:22.23 on its course and I just forgot to I was just being lazy and I was like I got a

00:05:27.12 bunch of slacks I'll slack later and then I just never did and then we sold

00:05:32.17 hundreds upon hundreds and absolutely absolutely ridiculous makes no sense

00:05:36.16 I know the premise was we did this and jack's gonna be annoyed by it and we'll

00:05:40.12 remove it eventually when jack jack sees it respectfully I don't think jack's

00:05:45.22 feelings matter anymore it is the most profitable shirt of 2022. I think it

00:05:50.17 just has to stay like I think the audience is [ __ ] jack in a weird way

00:05:54.07 yeah no buying the shirt we have just the best listeners that's our next shirt

00:05:58.12 is [ __ ] jack's feelings look for that shirt coming soon it's going to sell 10

00:06:01.23 000

00:06:03.22 [Laughter]

00:06:05.03 Do a variation of it the idea that in the spreadsheet as the profit goes up

00:06:09.18 the guilt goes down

00:06:13.16 it does well I mean and just the fence I feel like you've the closest you do

00:06:18.11 another show with jack it's clearly out of your hands at this point you would

00:06:23.18 love to I'm sure remove a thing that he's annoyed by but it's it's undeniably

00:06:27.16 successful it would make no sense I mean we don't have a choice

00:06:32.10 bad business it would be terrible business I will say I do think it

00:06:36.03 legitimately pissed him off oh absolutely that's maybe the funniest

00:06:41.12 part what makes you say that uh I can tell by his demeanor when we

00:06:45.20 were together that he was he was certainly annoyed by it and uh

00:06:49.15 and I think I think even more annoyed by how well it's sold how do we make it up

00:06:54.03 to it why I don't think we have to I think uh

00:06:57.09 I don't know maybe do we get him a gift basket

00:07:00.20 I don't think we have to we can get him one of the shirts do you think that's a

00:07:05.03 great idea maybe we could get him a special one

00:07:07.20 that is like a unique color like a one of one maybe we should put together a

00:07:12.00 special face guilt basket that we sent to people [Laughter]

00:07:23.01 a regulation basket yeah we'll send it to the director of the tuxedo we'll send

00:07:28.13 one to jack oh my god we got to do that what if we also promote him uh what if

00:07:34.02 we give him like a 10-day contract back to the big leagues and he could be

00:07:37.20 minorly or he'd be major league fan jack on a 10-day expiring contract.

00:07:46.20 [Laughter]

00:07:49.22 Um I like that Kevin you're like was he

00:07:53.17 really mad it's like yeah yeah it's it's it's a joke based off of a thing he

00:07:58.10 created it's like something his number one interest it seems like of course

00:08:03.05 that would be something I'd be annoyed by like it's not

00:08:06.10 obviously he would be upset by it more people bought the shirt than listen to

00:08:11.02 the podcast

00:08:16.19 no we should be clear that's not true that's that true it might be close but

00:08:22.11 it's not true it's not true but it's a really funny mean thing to say

00:08:27.00 okay I I couldn't stop myself it's obviously not true

00:08:31.14 but I had to yeah it had to come out so I couldn't I couldn't swallow that

00:08:35.20 poison I feel like at this point we've we've

00:08:38.22 got back at jack not showing up to uh any of the break [ __ ] multiple times

00:08:43.22 over at this point yeah yeah also he said he wanted to go on

00:08:48.13 that but Eric didn't send him the calendar invite dude that is I talked to

00:08:53.20 Geoff about that like when we did this break [ __ ] yesterday uh that [ __ ]

00:08:59.07 Floored me I was so like I could not believe that he said that and meant it

00:09:03.15 like [Laughter]

00:09:05.03 he was there when we were like going to record them

00:09:10.10 he was there and watched us set up he hung out for like the better part of

00:09:15.10 half an hour and then it was getting onto showtime and he went well

00:09:20.19 see you later I'm pretty sure we talked to him yes yes

00:09:25.04 it wasn't a secret we told him over and over that we wanted him on

00:09:30.12 so like no I will I won't stand for that like that's ridiculous he did this to

00:09:36.10 himself and like everything else he's done it to himself and only has himself

00:09:40.05 to blame I feel like he texted you that he was out or he texted Geoff in one of

00:09:45.10 the first ones that like specifically there was a reach out by jack oh my god

00:09:49.13 like he was invited he was on calendar invites for the first bunch and

00:09:53.14 like he was like a last-minute scratch from the first three of them I think I

00:09:57.17 will in defense of of jack if you don't get a calendar invite but you say you're

00:10:02.00 invite it doesn't it's like a it feels like a 50 he's had he's had calendar

00:10:05.21 invite but if you have a calendar invite you do not make it then that is its own

00:10:09.07 I cannot that's not defendable what happens if you don't have a calendar

00:10:12.20 invite but you're there as everyone's setting up and about to go live with it

00:10:16.19 and you know it's happening and you know you haven't made the other ones so the

00:10:20.13 invitation is still open and people are saying [ __ ] like yeah it'd be cool to

00:10:24.23 have you on today man yeah if somebody says to me

00:10:28.00 I'd like for you to be on this or it'd be really cool for you to be on this

00:10:31.07 then that goes out the window if there's

00:10:33.05 just an assumption of being welcome then I'm kind of on his side in that moment

00:10:37.07 the open invite doesn't it's it's a tricky thing it feels fake a lot of the

00:10:41.18 time I would be careful to get on not to get on eric's bad side on this one he's

00:10:46.06 he's I don't I don't know how it would be I don't understand how

00:10:50.13 it would be tricky jack we want you on this and then he blew us off three hang

00:10:54.06 on and then he blew us off three times and then we just kept doing these things

00:10:58.13 and going like would be cool if you came

00:11:00.23 and then he was there as we were setting up I'll never forget that we were there

00:11:04.15 he was there as we were setting up and like

00:11:07.01 oh is he I mean really it was hi he left and me and Geoff just went

00:11:10.23 I mean I didn't want to say anything I had to see if he was going to stick

00:11:14.15 around or not and he just left and it was like a solution for this

00:11:17.21 yeah the next break [ __ ] we do it from wherever jack is

00:11:23.01 like a break [ __ ] flash mob

00:11:33.18 are they going to let us open baseball cards at universal studios [Laughter]

00:11:40.17 doing rips on a roller coaster oh my god somebody write this down we'll forget

00:11:45.20 about that that's a great idea anyway uh thanks to the comment levers

00:11:52.10 and the regulation listeners both of you

00:11:55.20 uh for buying that shirt and being in on that joke it was uh

00:12:00.06 holy nominal turnout I love this listener base more than more than any

00:12:04.11 I've ever been a part of I think uh I I totally agree I completely agree

00:12:09.03 I think uh I think that we've all cultivated a

00:12:11.17 quite a little community together uh us and then

00:12:14.08 uh speaking of you know what's funny I've been you know I have my tendrils

00:12:18.00 everywhere in the company and so I watch

00:12:20.10 uh I keep up on the comments and how all the different content is doing and I I

00:12:24.15 read a lot and I'm seeing comment lever and regulation listener as a preface all

00:12:29.01 over the place outside of our face world now I'm seeing

00:12:32.06 like hey guys uh comment leaver here or I guess I'm a comment later now you used

00:12:35.16 to be a regulation listener anyway I really like the new episode of ruby and

00:12:40.06 it's just like makes it has no ties to the face at this point

00:12:44.12 which is very gratifying if I read somewhere I'm a big ruby guy

00:12:47.15 I'll be very happy like that'll be the that's like the chariot it's uh

00:12:52.05 anyways it's become like a part of the vernacular I guess is what I'm trying to

00:12:56.12 say which I I really appreciate yeah that's awesome it's so funny oh hey I uh

00:13:01.01 I spent some time uh Eric mentioned we did a break [ __ ]

00:13:05.12 yesterday we did like a mini break [ __ ]

00:13:08.13 just he and I uh and uh uh which by the way

00:13:11.01 everybody else is invited to it's just we're gonna try to get the cadence up to

00:13:14.06 doing it weekly and we figure we'll do like three smaller ones that are just he

00:13:17.16 and I or me and somebody else and then the big monthly one with the full cast

00:13:21.18 and the sound board and everything uh-huh um

00:13:24.09 is that okay with you Gavin well yeah we were just Andrew and I were on halo and

00:13:27.22 we were trying to decide whether we were invited to that

00:13:30.15 yeah Emily was having the same the same confusion as well yeah everybody's

00:13:34.02 invited I think we were just trying to pull something like it was 60 minutes it

00:13:38.13 was in and out real fast it was like a half the set set up uh it was more just

00:13:42.14 uh yeah just to try to get like not everyone has to be like a major

00:13:46.00 production but anyway and then uh over the weekend I spent some time with Eric

00:13:50.06 we went swimming together or whether we went to bar ton springs

00:13:53.08 together uh also with 10 day expiring contract major league fan jack was there

00:13:58.06 as well and uh I learned something about Eric and I was going to see a few what

00:14:02.00 you guys think you guys know Eric our producer Eric bed our right yeah

00:14:07.07 yeah uh that last part was a burp I was not part of his name

00:14:11.07 uh would you guess him to be a water guy or not a water guy hmm well he's from

00:14:17.04 California has California but it has water on it

00:14:22.17 so I would say he's not a water guy so you think because he's from southern

00:14:28.05 because he's from san Diego surrounded by water he's not a water guy yeah I'm

00:14:33.09 trying to figure out if rats like water and then making a choice

00:14:37.23 based upon that information I'm gonna say rats are not water guys

00:14:41.19 so I'm gonna say also I'm gonna agree with Gavin eric's not a water guy I

00:14:45.12 would have pegged uh I would have pegged Eric as a water guy

00:14:49.08 through and through for a lot of reasons uh a lot of pretty much everybody who

00:14:54.06 has a mustache as a water guy uh he's got water guy glasses he's from

00:14:58.15 san Diego he's always in shorts super and super into wrestling and I

00:15:03.11 feel like most people that are into wrestling are into [ __ ] like four

00:15:06.14 wheelers and jet skis and fun stuff like that and that just like I feel like if

00:15:10.17 you like wrestling you like water right you're like

00:15:13.14 like Kenny powers likes water you like water yeah and uh and uh for all these

00:15:17.17 reasons and the whole san Diego of it all I just assumed he was a water guy

00:15:21.20 went to bar ton springs not a water guy now what does that mean exactly well

00:15:26.17 that's the thing it's not that I'm I'm not a water guy like hey let's jump

00:15:31.14 in like this really deep water and then just tread water for a long time which

00:15:36.10 is what we did um for a long time uh I mean like the water was cold and it was

00:15:42.02 nine feet deep and I just kept kicking um when

00:15:45.16 when I think of going to the water or going to the beach I like being

00:15:51.12 near the water with a drink in my hand and then sublime is playing from a radio

00:15:58.04 or a cover band not too far away that is my ideal water scenario so I'm

00:16:03.11 like a near-water guy I'm just not necessarily yeah I don't like being in one

00:16:08.10 yeah I just no I don't think I've ever been in water and gone like ah the right

00:16:13.14 temperature it's always very cold and I don't like it's tough

00:16:17.14 when I saw him yesterday so we went we went on Sunday we were all celebrating

00:16:22.02 mother's day together jack and Eric and I uh by going swimming uh with our

00:16:26.21 significant others uh and uh anyway when I saw him on Wednesday

00:16:31.03 to do the break [ __ ] he goes he goes you know uh you know what it's like when

00:16:34.09 you're in the water and you can't touch the bottom and you dip down and you

00:16:37.12 touch the bottom and the bottom is slimy uh and you wonder what is that and I'm

00:16:41.10 like yeah I guess and he's like I haven't stopped thinking about that for

00:16:44.22 four days yeah yes yeah like the weeds and algae and all that stuff in there I

00:16:49.15 didn't realize how deep nine feet is until you jump in and go all the way to

00:16:54.10 the bottom and then it's slimy and then you have to kick as hard as you can all

00:16:58.20 the way up and you just go like oh I'm never gonna forget this probably as long

00:17:02.07 as I live I I think the scariest thing to me about water that's around like if

00:17:08.02 you're in water and it's like 10 or 11

00:17:10.16 feet deep it's just the same as it being 450 feet deep

00:17:15.03 it's the same level of fear absolutely agree with you

00:17:18.10 percent nine feet might as well be the Mariana trench it's all bad and I don't

00:17:23.14 like it why is the depth intimidating because what's down there and also what

00:17:28.13 touched me and also how do I get out of it I don't and it something could grab

00:17:34.03 me at any moment what the freshwater sharks I don't know I guess I

00:17:38.19 don't I don't associate depth with those feelings or concerns that is my number

00:17:43.09 one concern in like the ocean what a [ __ ] shark eats me or whatever

00:17:48.10 ridiculous thought but depth never comes into play so

00:17:52.11 that that makes me question Andrew would you consider yourself a water guy not a

00:17:57.03 water guy or a near water guy I am I think the biggest water guy but I think

00:18:02.02 there's different classes of water guy am I a water sports guy no I'm not a

00:18:06.06 water sports guy love being in the water love being around the water you love

00:18:11.18 your nuts don't I terrible knots but I I do not I'm not

00:18:15.22 gonna ride I'm not gonna ride a jet ski type thing that doesn't appeal to me I

00:18:19.14 mean I I'm willing to but that's not a thing I'm excited about I think the only

00:18:23.21 vehicle classification I'd say I get maybe excited about on the water is a

00:18:27.18 kayak but kayak guy I love a good kayak but outside of that

00:18:31.12 I'd say I'm generally an in the water guy would be my highest water ranking I

00:18:36.08 think I I think that makes total sense uh okay uh nick

00:18:39.04 I'd like to ask you as well or would you consider yourself I would nick I got to

00:18:42.19 be honest you look like a big water guy to me you seem like a huge water guy

00:18:46.17 love water I thought so big water guy absolutely don't get enough of it

00:18:49.16 because you know Texas yeah yeah that well at least at least I'm not

00:18:53.12 losing my mind then okay I have a question for Eric then is Eric are you a

00:18:57.20 hot tub guy if this is a temperature issue mainly what

00:19:00.12 do you would you hop in a hot tub at every available opportunity uh I don't

00:19:04.21 know about every available opportunity but like I have I I like spending time

00:19:10.19 in a hot tub again I I like being near the water so it the same thing

00:19:16.08 holds where if there's a hot tub and I have a drink in my hand and

00:19:19.21 sublime is on a radio or there is a cover band playing sublime I'm thrilled

00:19:25.16 I don't have to be in the water to be having a good time but you wouldn't go

00:19:30.13 in a nine foot deep hot tub that sounds so can you imagine oh my god that's the

00:19:35.07 scariest [ __ ] thing that's just all that's like a hole it's just four feet

00:19:40.23 wide but nine feet down hey all right come up in the drowned tube oh my god

00:19:45.06 well there's one way down and no way's up that's like a giant stockpot from

00:19:50.20 [ __ ] like when you see bugs bunny characters cooking each other god damn uh

00:19:55.12 Gavin water guy near the water guy uh not a water guy yeah I love the wall guy

00:20:00.04 I mean I love the water guy big Kevin costner fan love him

00:20:04.10 what a guy I would say once I'm acclimatized I can't get enough of it

00:20:08.18 like especially in the ocean like being in the sea getting pelted by the waves

00:20:13.20 can we get a love of the water guys shirt yeah I'm just imagining the water

00:20:17.11 boy but it's the water guy we we have a tendency uh even when we're joking like

00:20:21.07 I saw a bunch of people that are like I would like a shirt have her a shirt

00:20:24.19 please or a shirt wear shirt please we

00:20:26.13 gotta not beat that [ __ ] into the ground

00:20:28.09 because I would be definitely tempted to

00:20:30.12 to dumb shirt my way into the poor house you know what um

00:20:33.23 meg said she would absolutely buy a shirt have a slash shirt buy a shirt

00:20:38.12 when I was like I think shirt haver is something we

00:20:42.06 probably should do what if it's a what if we put it on a koozie I guess why

00:20:47.14 why can't we just put it on a shirt we can do that too

00:20:52.00 oh you do that too I don't you want a koozie to say shirt have her

00:20:57.12 typically no hang on because typically when I have a koozie I don't have a

00:21:03.18 shirt on I'm drinking near the water and there's no shirt.

00:21:09.14 I'm just trying really hard to make koozies happen

00:21:13.06 you really want koozies to happen I really liked one didn't

00:21:18.19 we had a Vancouver child kicker koozie that you could buy by itself or a pack

00:21:24.02 of four that didn't have that one in it it was removed from that I don't know

00:21:29.01 why we sold one by itself and then four is a group that had not that didn't

00:21:33.20 include one of the ones that was by itself

00:21:36.13 madness uh yeah I don't begin to know uh how to answer that question so

00:21:41.20 I will say I didn't have an issue my premise Gavin

00:21:45.23 isn't my issue with your shirt haver shirt isn't that it shouldn't exist it was

00:21:51.05 that you framed it as in this is a market we need to cater to that is the

00:21:55.15 absurdity of your statement I don't know how they end up on the store I don't

00:21:59.15 know how they find that show like the person who is that person that you're

00:22:03.12 trying to aim that product to as a joke as like a dumb thing hilarious but like

00:22:09.11 you treated it like you're tapping into an audience that we didn't have that was

00:22:13.14 my issue

00:22:15.22 look you know I'm mostly on your side with this it seems that it seems to have

00:22:20.20 a broad appeal uh I mean meg likes it right yeah she's she's neither a comment

00:22:26.04 leaver or a regulation listener although there you go she is a comment leaver on

00:22:31.07 other podcasts which I found to be insane what she's left comments

00:22:36.05 on other podcasts so she's a comment leaver but just not for us

00:22:40.08 I I don't know if I should be offended or or what that's interesting uh

00:22:46.03 I do feel like shirt haver is a well why doesn't she leave cotton okay

00:22:50.14 well I what podcast um what is do you feel comfortable saying it on on

00:22:55.22 on our podcast uh yeah I think it was last podcast on

00:23:00.02 the left I don't like people anymore or maybe the dollop I don't like

00:23:05.04 goatees you want meg to listen to this oh I'm totally happy with her never

00:23:09.16 listen to this that's how I feel yeah I I think about

00:23:13.23 all of I think about the discomfort it could cause Gavin and that feels like an

00:23:18.08 opportunity my main thing is that I really enjoy telling her the highlights

00:23:22.13 of it like I really enjoy filling her in if she if she's like yeah I know then

00:23:27.01 it's not you know I do I will say I I will say it makes dinners more fun

00:23:31.11 because we always have a lot to talk about yeah yeah uh

00:23:35.11 I do think a shirt haver is a funnier shirt than an anal passage shirt for sure

00:23:40.11 which we got to pull that down at some point maybe it's already down no we

00:23:43.11 don't leave it up for you leave it up forever

00:23:47.14 I guess it is probably the best-selling face shirt it's the best shirt of the

00:23:52.17 year it's not even face you can't pull it down I'd love to but I'm so happy and

00:23:57.22 I'm done I'm so annoyed as well because it's not our best shirt

00:24:03.10 no no no we've made some killer stuff that's not even as funny as the other

00:24:09.14 jack shirt we made the ball jack shirt yeah we made some really good stuff

00:24:15.21 it's also a parody of a parody you know what yeah

00:24:19.01 it's the universal studios logo that says annual pass and then we made

00:24:25.16 a shirt that said anal passage so really it's like we're putting a hat on a hat

00:24:30.13 here people love

00:24:34.00 maybe we should only modify the anal that like that shirt we should just come

00:24:38.23 up with what comes after anal passage but we always put it in that design.

00:24:44.06 [Laughter]

00:24:45.12 You'll be able to see all our shirts slowly evolve [Laughter]

00:24:49.11 oh hey I did uh I did I caught myself doing one of the dumber things I've ever

00:24:54.17 done maybe in my life last night and it here's the thing I'm afraid I've been

00:25:00.21 doing it for a couple weeks now and not realizing it

00:25:05.12 oh I can't wait this is incredible uh I'll start off by saying uh you know I'm

00:25:11.21 uh I kind of flutter between an agnostic uh and uh atheist

00:25:16.00 uh in terms of my uh religious beliefs and it's uh it is honestly something I

00:25:21.05 think about uh the more the closer to death you get the more you think about

00:25:25.07 it the older I get the I find the more I

00:25:26.04 think about this stuff uh which is why I kind of bounce around between the two

00:25:30.15 but um on occasion I will pray at the end of

00:25:33.22 the day you know like in bed uh it's kind of like uh

00:25:36.20 sometimes you just do it because you did it as a kid you don't even realize

00:25:39.18 you're doing it and then uh I'll catch myself

00:25:42.23 like when you're a kid you have like a prey mantra that you just say the same

00:25:45.22 thing over I'll catch myself praying for people that are dead and I'm like oh

00:25:49.03 wait my grandpa died 10 years ago stop praying for him uh

00:25:51.15 but like and I don't do it very often just on occasion but I have a like an

00:25:55.04 extended family member who is going through an illness right now and so I

00:25:59.08 he's been on my mind a lot and so I've been thinking like you know I'll just

00:26:02.06 whether it's [ __ ] or not I'm gonna put some good out in the world you know

00:26:05.11 put some positive energy out there so each night for the last couple weeks

00:26:08.10 I've been praying that his uh his treatment goes well and uh I was

00:26:13.03 doing it last night and as I was doing it last night I realized I was saying

00:26:18.11 dear Alexa I was praying to Alexa in my head

00:26:22.04 and now I realize I'm pretty sure I've been saying Alexa this whole time I'm

00:26:27.05 pretty sure I've been praying to Alexa why why

00:26:29.22 I don't know I don't know because I say hey Alexa a lot to talk to the robot in

00:26:35.09 the house wait so you're you your brain is processing like you're

00:26:40.00 leaving a note like yeah talking to your automated

00:26:43.12 device or whatever maybe like Alexa like turn up like Alexa turn off you're so

00:26:48.15 used to like when you're doing a task to say Alexa first that it is now entered

00:26:54.12 into your prayer yeah 100

00:26:56.08 like I talked to Alexa I talked to Alexa more

00:26:59.12 I talked to Alexa more in the day than anybody else you know

00:27:03.11 Alexa my whole house is automated by Alexa so we communicate constantly and I

00:27:08.06 think I think at night I just like I just have been going like I could cuz I

00:27:11.05 caught myself doing it last night and I went this this doesn't feel like the

00:27:14.06 first time I've done this just felt way too familiar I was just like dear Alexa

00:27:19.22 please look after Millie and Emily and my mom and my grandma

00:27:24.01 hey Alexa full of grace the lord yeah I don't say it like that I just I just

00:27:28.20 it's always like dear lord you know but I guess I've been saying dear Alexa or

00:27:32.23 hey Alex helix are open channels to god [Laughter]

00:27:40.08 I'm picturing it's like you're calling out to Heimdall to open the by frost

00:27:48.06 anyway when I realized I did it I had to get up and go go to my phone and write

00:27:52.19 the [ __ ] note down because I'd left my phone in the other room because it

00:27:56.08 was I wonder if I couldn't believe it yes do you have an Alexa in that room

00:27:59.19 yeah I wonder if it's picked up on any of that I wonder if if you go into your

00:28:03.10 app does it just have a load of prayer like well I don't pray out loud I'm not

00:28:07.12 it's not like I'm sitting with my knees at the bed with praying it's just like

00:28:10.22 laying in bed on the pillow and Alexa can't yet read your thoughts so that's

00:28:14.06 totally fine to my knowledge she does not currently read my thoughts

00:28:18.13 there has to be if this is happening with your prayer this has to be

00:28:21.19 happening in other areas too I'm just curious to like what extent what hey

00:28:26.17 Alexa has gone undetected by you oh I mean I definitely call

00:28:31.01 uh definitely call my girlfriend and my daughter Alexa [Laughter]

00:28:36.10 like not every day but more than once a week

00:28:39.18 probably what for sure this podcast will be a nightmare for people playing it I

00:28:44.23 don't think that works anymore I think it doesn't I don't know I think they

00:28:49.02 fixed that somehow because I see it because it comes up in tv commercials

00:28:53.03 and tv shows all the time and it never triggers mine huh all right I I'm

00:28:57.18 this is so it's like you have a deeper connection with Alexa no no like walking

00:29:02.23 phoenix and her like you have this long standing you and Alexa number one your

00:29:08.06 best buddy I will say I will say my girlfriend thinks that Alexa is

00:29:12.16 noticeably nicer to me than her and she is annoyed by it uh but I'm very

00:29:16.09 friendly to Alexa so it makes sense that she would be friendly to me I mean be

00:29:19.18 careful eventually Alexa Google home and Syria will all get together and leave

00:29:24.23 well I don't I have nothing to do with Google home or Siri I I'm gonna I'm

00:29:29.19 gonna elect you don't [ __ ] with Google [ __ ] with Google home

00:29:33.18 uh I know where my bread is buttered it's buttered uh by Alexa uh anyway I

00:29:39.01 can't be the only person on earth that's done this surely

00:29:43.11 surely somebody else has done that I mean statistically maybe

00:29:47.17 but not I mean that's a wild that's an insane thing to do Geoff and I love it

00:29:53.07 I'm proud of you for sharing that hey Alexa what a [ __ ] and it

00:29:59.14 it's like the most personal thoughts and you've tied it to Geoff bezos

00:30:04.23 Alexa is the name that I say the most in the world that I shout out to the world

00:30:10.16 when I want to speak to an inanimate object so at night when I'm half asleep

00:30:14.12 and I'm speaking to the other inanimate object I just got the names flipped

00:30:19.03 sure I guess it's logical but it's just a wild mistake to make

00:30:24.23 I'm just glad you noticed it yeah I just wonder how long I've been doing it for

00:30:30.19 oh man I love that so much just that it's all internal oh 100 internal too yeah.

00:30:37.19 [Applause]

00:32:28.23 burned out without even knowing it symptoms can include lack of motivation

00:32:34.06 feeling helpless or trapped detachment fatigue and more

00:32:37.15 I have experienced burnout quite a few times in life for all sorts

00:32:42.01 of reasons whether it be personal or work it can be really exhausting and it's

00:32:47.14 just it's tough it's tough to do anything and then that

00:32:50.05 can kind of snowball into a bunch of other issues at least in my experience

00:32:54.04 we associate burnout with work but that's not the only cause

00:32:57.07 any of our roles in life can lead us to feel burned out and better help online

00:33:00.22 therapy wants to remind you to prioritize yourself talking with someone

00:33:04.11 can help you figure out what's causing stress in your life

00:33:07.05 therapy is something that has been incredibly helpful to me I mention it

00:33:12.10 every time I do these ads I had a lot of different issues

00:33:15.13 happening in my personal life I struggled with finding people to talk to

00:33:19.12 and just being able to regularly discuss things that were going on really

00:33:24.03 helped me unpack certain issues as well as just discover ways that I was being

00:33:27.19 impacted that I didn't even realize so if if you're considering therapy I would

00:33:32.12 highly recommend it it's it's something that has made a tremendous impact on my

00:34:09.09 I'm excited for this oh Geoff what's that

00:34:14.08 what does that look like so you need to you need to tee this up

00:34:18.11 looks like people that are just listening it's like a video game clip

00:34:22.13 it's not loaded video game club uh what game would you say that is based off of

00:34:26.10 the thumbnail that you're looking at Geoff uh hold on

00:34:30.16 looks like halo it looks like halo okay okay somebody took the lead I can't

00:34:35.14 really read it is it huh I don't know I don't know what I'm looking at

00:34:42.10 we're not a halo podcast so why am I looking at this well what it might be

00:34:46.20 it's instead of a 13 year old 240p clip of my overkill

00:34:51.16 it might be a 4k remastered all five views full game video to prove my

00:34:58.15 innocence to you damn skeptics are you uh

00:35:02.17 are you still on that didn't we move on from that forever again

00:35:07.02 yeah we did I was I found my old original I was looking for a

00:35:11.16 an oblivion save because I want to try and complete oblivion uh was it 16 years

00:35:17.12 after I put it down and I found on that same Xbox my

00:35:22.10 original overkill clip the full clip so now that's the final piece

00:35:27.11 of evidence I need to put out there so does this does this exonerate you or

00:35:32.04 prove your guilt I can't even remember which way I went I'll let you be the

00:35:35.14 fish [Laughter]

00:35:38.21 Andrew it sounds like Geoff move Andrew I just respect the move by you

00:35:44.11 you were so anti he's cheated he cheated

00:35:46.16 you're in the no like you're denying all evidence and then everything's brought

00:35:50.16 forward and you couldn't care that doesn't matter Geoff has known since

00:35:55.18 the day it happened that I did it for real and uh and I know that for a fact

00:36:00.20 but now now this is no now we cannot doubt it I guess uh

00:36:07.03 I mean it doesn't the video show the same [ __ ] that happened last time well

00:36:12.03 you can actually see it this time now you can see and you can see everyone

00:36:15.10 else in the game fighting the entire game you see every perspective the events

00:36:19.19 that lead to the overkill I feel like this is pretty damning we can officially

00:36:24.01 close the book on if Gavin cheated or not I think this is definitive evidence

00:36:27.20 I'll say this I'll say this it's it's either evidence

00:36:31.00 that he did it or evidence that Gavin is

00:36:32.21 a really good director which we've known for a very long time

00:36:36.13 I don't I don't think I found the same people and got them to pop it out

00:36:41.09 no I think you could have been directing them in the moment oh oh

00:36:45.16 well next girl good point I didn't you would hire a lawyer you would know uh

00:36:50.00 you would know that you would need to to uh do some work to to make it look

00:36:54.11 legitimate for Bernie and I to believe you

00:36:56.23 and so no but you know at the end of the day it doesn't really matter you you

00:37:01.10 cheated or maybe you didn't I don't know yeah maybe a hundred years maybe I

00:37:05.20 didn't maybe I don't know what just I'm just putting it to bed I'm

00:37:10.06 just just finalizing that storyline put it to bed you pulled it you you woke it

00:37:14.13 up and brought it out of bed and took it into the living room and then made it

00:37:17.22 talk for a little bit and now you're putting it back to bed no it's no no

00:37:21.22 it's fully to bed it was it was nodding off the last time [Laughter]

00:37:26.08 it was left and I think there was still some wiggle room I agree with Gavin this

00:37:30.18 is now definitively the case is done and we can move on to other halo things

00:37:36.10 this isn't the only halo thing we have to talk about Gavin and I have been

00:37:40.09 playing a little bit of halo recently I'm going to send you a clip Geoff okay I

00:37:45.14 guess I'll upload it in our slack I will also upload these to

00:37:50.03 maybe I'll give a link on the twitter account so people can watch these things

00:37:53.10 can I do I have a setting actually watch

00:37:55.14 it or can I pretend to watch it like the last one oh you have to actually watch

00:37:59.00 this one okay but it's only like 12

00:38:01.18 seconds so I'm going to send you a clip and I want you to tell me

00:38:05.23 based off of this clip what do you think

00:38:07.23 is happening here and then I'll give you

00:38:09.22 another give you another clip after that after you make a quick little guess

00:38:13.12 I'll have these up on the twitter in some capacities good look at them here

00:38:17.07 we go appears to be halo

00:38:21.22 what the [ __ ] just happened so what do you what would you guess

00:38:26.10 happen based off of that clip uh I think somebody shot somebody in the

00:38:30.01 back of the head maybe what am I supposed to see here

00:38:33.04 I was just I was just curious what you think is going I'm going to send you

00:38:36.10 another clip and you can make another guess as to what's happening this is the

00:38:39.16 second clip also halo also very brief will be up in the slack in a moment it

00:38:43.20 is now up again and then once once you make this guess

00:38:46.12 we will go into I think the story of what is actually going on

00:38:51.07 so what would you say is happening based on that clip oh uh

00:38:55.23 I think maybe somebody's dropped their controller or they've got

00:38:59.07 a rubber banded or something because they're they're just shooting in circles

00:39:02.09 and running around looking like an idiot yeah

00:39:05.03 so the clip is somebody shooting in circles running like an idiot uh

00:39:08.18 a few days ago maybe like a week at this point Gavin and I were playing halo and

00:39:13.02 somehow the topic came up about how hard it would be to get a kill

00:39:17.09 and tactical slayer which used to be swat it's not a tactical slayer

00:39:21.05 blindfolded how long would it take how many games would it be is this a thing

00:39:25.06 we could we could do potentially and I brought up because tactical slayer

00:39:29.08 now has a bunch of different guns within it one of them being the mangler uh I

00:39:32.20 was like I think the mangler would be tougher toughest to do Gavin said I'll

00:39:36.14 give you a thousand dollars if you can get a blindfolded mangler kill so we

00:39:41.05 have been playing blind halo infinite like one game

00:39:45.12 whenever we play the first one we did we load in it's so funny to play halo

00:39:50.15 with only sound as your context like trying to guess what level level you're

00:39:54.18 on based on what the floor sounds like and how you're moving around and trying

00:39:58.20 to chase sound and having no concept of what you're doing so we played through

00:40:03.05 our first game and we both took our blindfolds off and

00:40:06.23 we had zero kills we had zero of everything we did absolutely nothing I

00:40:11.16 think I went 0 and 60.

00:40:13.16 Yeah he was like oh it's 16 I was like oh and 18 it was bad we're terrible

00:40:17.13 in halo infinite there is a box that people can use to type and send messages

00:40:22.00 to what I first noticed was we didn't have

00:40:24.18 any score the second thing I noticed is that box was filled with text and that's

00:40:30.01 something you don't typically see we had no idea our team hated us to the

00:40:34.21 point in which they were talking about it in the chat like as soon as we

00:40:40.06 started somebody is like what are these [ __ ] [ __ ] doing they're useless

00:40:44.12 and then I think someone from the other team replied like hey it's just a video

00:40:50.00 game man be cool and then they saw that we just kept

00:40:53.12 running in the walls and they're like no these guys suck [ __ ] these guys we

00:40:57.15 united the entire like our the rest of our team and the other team into hating

00:41:02.12 us and they all reported us for I guess poor sportsmanship everyone was so mad

00:41:07.10 at us that was our first game we deserved it we did but we're just having

00:41:11.22 fun and like it was goofy and it's not ranked it doesn't really matter you were

00:41:16.15 like oh maybe we got a kill I think I heard somebody maybe I hit someone so to

00:41:21.22 take the blindfold off and just see rage from everybody in the game aimed at us

00:41:25.15 was very funny we didn't then we did the second game the first clip you saw Geoff

00:41:30.09 which was running I was me running into a wall and then running off the back of

00:41:35.09 the map and I I ran off the back of the map fell in

00:41:39.12 the water and I distinctly remember saying to Gavin I found a river

00:41:43.11 what level has a river in it that was the thing is that at the beginning we

00:41:46.14 don't even know which map we're on so we

00:41:49.12 can't even like visualize where we are I see so what you guys are saying here is

00:41:53.10 the other clip from 20 years ago when Gavin would got the overkill everybody

00:41:57.14 else was blindfolded I think that's what we want

00:42:00.16 that makes now that now you tied it together it all makes sense so did you

00:42:04.17 guys ever get a did you actually get a kill well I have I have one more clip to

00:42:10.02 show you I'll put it in the slack so I was very confident that I hit

00:42:13.10 somebody but I wasn't sure if it was a teammate or not or like what exactly was

00:42:17.18 going on so this clip I couldn't believe it at the end of the

00:42:22.05 second game took off the blindfold I had one kill and I immediately had to see

00:42:27.15 how in the [ __ ] did this happen I was gonna do a thing in my head I

00:42:31.20 thought about doing uh eric's is great for an audio podcast for

00:42:35.12 sure we [ __ ] edited it what are you talking about that's an insane statement

00:42:39.20 to make oh you you meleed somebody in the back of the head I mailed someone in

00:42:43.12 the back of that I gotta kill blindfolded in our second game I thought

00:42:46.20 about doing a thing on our twitch account of being like I'm gonna stream a

00:42:50.15 blind game of halo infinite every day it'll take a year or whatever for me to

00:42:56.00 actually get a kill it happened in the second game and I was so excited

00:42:59.13 and disappointed the second clip that I showed you Geoff actually has the kill in

00:43:03.16 it somehow blindfolded Gavin and I worked together where he was shooting

00:43:07.18 blindly in a field just spinning in a circle and that distracted people and I

00:43:12.17 happened to run up and hit one of them in the back while running forward so it

00:43:17.22 was a combined duo blind kill it was amazing how

00:43:20.10 how much better we got at figuring out where we were in relation to each other

00:43:24.01 like just going on sound like steering towards the fight based on just stereo

00:43:28.03 hearing yeah and we're using like gunshots to try and identify with each

00:43:32.02 other words sometimes we can like hear each other meleeing at walton st we

00:43:36.11 actually got a lot better than we did in the second game than the first game

00:43:39.21 there's a lot of growth it was like distinguishing when you're hitting a

00:43:43.05 wall and what that sounds like and then knowing like I gotta move but it's just

00:43:47.07 it's insane to me that we pulled this off within two games

00:43:50.02 um sadly it was not a mangler kill so where are you gonna take it from here I

00:43:53.19 don't that's a great question we haven't really I haven't thought about it that

00:43:56.22 much what if you guys get a stream it on twitch or whatever you

00:44:01.14 talked about but uh for like a year and try to get a combined 117 kills why 117

00:44:07.12 just 117 because master chief is that is that the idea okay

00:44:11.19 okay because I I don't know I I don't I've never played a game actually blind

00:44:17.16 and I assume there's a lot of games that are playable as a blind person but I

00:44:22.18 can't imagine an fps like is there a way that that's done typically

00:44:28.06 I I'm not sure with like accessibility it seems like

00:44:30.16 still a long ways to go in games but it feels like there have been certain games

00:44:34.12 at least that have made more of an effort in that direction

00:44:38.10 I'm not sure what it's like to play in fps purely blind I know there are things

00:44:43.14 uh in games like punch out punch out has a really big blind speed running

00:44:48.03 community which is [ __ ] crazy to watch it's really interesting to see

00:44:51.12 people like just knowing how to move based on sound

00:44:54.13 yeah there's a whole I watched a whole super Mario 64 speed run that was

00:44:58.19 blindfolded and it was utterly insane like running into walls

00:45:01.17 to line up against other jumps and stuff it's it's pretty mental stuff it's very

00:45:06.07 it's incredible yeah what people can pull off but lots of sound cues

00:45:10.18 people are capable of so much more than we'll ever achieve

00:45:15.12 yeah sure oh absolutely yeah undeniably it's impressive

00:45:20.07 everybody but us isn't really impressive [Music]

00:45:23.16 I saw andrew's beard oh [ __ ] how was it it's it's actually a really good bit

00:45:28.23 yeah he wasn't like that oh man I want to see his beard decent I could text you

00:45:33.07 the because we both uh can't text you we

00:45:35.18 were just texting each other pictures of our blindfolds so I was I basically saw

00:45:39.20 his chin

00:45:42.04 and I realized it's the first time I've seen Andrew since we started face

00:45:47.16 it was so weird it is strange I don't think I've seen you guys since

00:45:52.20 2018 or 19 at this time at this point which is hard to believe it's hard to

00:45:57.18 wrap wrap the brain around well that will end

00:46:00.19 soon with uh November are you gonna stop

00:46:03.16 talking to us no no November we're going oh right in November apparently yeah

00:46:08.19 there's some there's a bunch of side bets on whether you're gonna show up or

00:46:12.18 not oh I know I have written them down I'm keeping a list I'm aware of what's

00:46:17.08 going on jack is gonna owe me twenty dollars

00:46:20.04 you know what I'm gonna do with that twenty dollars I'm gonna invest it in a

00:46:24.08 wonderful anal passage shirt one of my favorite shirts great product

00:46:28.23 from jack directly I can't wait for vicks

00:46:32.02 I was bringing this up I'd love to hear your take on this because you're way

00:46:37.09 more of a music guy Geoff than I am same with you Eric I feel like you you

00:46:42.08 know quite a bit about music is every song that has a spelling sequence in it a

00:46:48.02 banger I was listening to respect and I was like this is a great [ __ ] song

00:46:53.14 everyone loves the part where you spell out respect

00:46:56.15 and then I started thinking about every song I could think of that has a

00:46:59.19 sequence in it and which they spell something it's [ __ ] great I love all

00:47:04.13 these give me another one what's another option uh bananas

00:47:14.12 well no there's only more there's um this isn't a word but like

00:47:19.20 sos by Rihanna s o s [ __ ] banger glamorous by Fergie

00:47:24.19 banger yeah it makes you wonder if other songs that don't do it would be just as

00:47:30.18 popular today like uh like drove my Chevy to the levy but the levy was d-r-y.

00:47:42.04 I feel like that would be an example of it yeah that wouldn't be satisfying

00:47:48.23 does ymca count or do acronyms that's I feel like that's still a

00:47:53.20 spelling sequence yeah I think it totally counts ymca is a great one

00:47:59.09 I'm sure there are ones that exist that are bad but like everyone I could think

00:48:04.10 of I was like that's a great [ __ ]

00:48:06.23 song it's a weird coincidence Saturday night my bay city rollers is a

00:48:10.10 great one s-a-t-u-r d-a why not great fantastic song

00:48:14.04 what a [ __ ] song that is I want to start a new segment on space where we

00:48:19.03 just listen to Andrew excitedly sing songs

00:48:23.09 do you have any other ones is there any song you can think of

00:48:27.11 I was really enjoying uh that your Saturday night by the way

00:48:31.14 I can't think of any other spell songs although I bet I bet the uh

00:48:37.05 regulation listeners and comment leavers can think of tons

00:48:41.03 I'm sure there's tons yeah that we're just not aware of I just literally

00:48:44.13 everyone I could think of I couldn't think of one or I was like I don't

00:48:47.16 really like that song they're all great I feel like I've had double g spelled a

00:48:51.20 few times absolutely and that's always great

00:48:54.15 that's never that's never bad that's always a banger

00:48:58.17 but speaking of of segments that we do we [ __ ] up last episode we're idiots

00:49:04.15 we did not make any guesses as to who the previously owned voices

00:49:09.06 I know Eric has compiled a document for you guys he's

00:49:12.19 got the information he just posted in the chat this cannot just endlessly go on

00:49:17.22 so I'm gonna put a little bit of pressure on the two of you because you have

00:49:22.19 information you have research you have the notes in front of you now you should

00:49:27.18 be able to solve this if you are not able to get it I'll give

00:49:30.18 you three more episodes not including this one three more you do not get it

00:49:35.07 within those three I'm just never gonna tell you ah you're a bastard why don't

00:49:39.22 you give us another clue uh okay a clue should we quickly read out the

00:49:44.00 guesses or the people yeah yeah why don't you why don't you go through the

00:49:48.12 game guesses so far nick fluke face Geoff flute face Andrew the

00:49:53.20 naming genius slash the acne the lawyer from higher judge

00:49:57.12 peter in brackets waffle p Jake Garfield cart furious racing champion Chris

00:50:04.00 called at the end of episode 14 and did the outro Caleb drew sapling ian Trevor

00:50:09.07 mcdonald's piss lady don zimmer's son humpty dumpty billy ripkin and the naimo

00:50:16.04 firefighter I don't remember half of those I don't either

00:50:20.11 yeah I feel like you guys must have just like shotgun guesses I guess we haven't

00:50:24.20 done that many episodes worth of guesses these are all confirmed guesses across

00:50:29.04 the board including some guesses from uh listeners that Andrew has I guess

00:50:34.13 they're commenting they've made guesses none of those people this is even gives

00:50:39.16 you gives you yeah yeah we gave you some here uh I'll give you a clue

00:50:45.01 uh so what is I wish I had a list of what you've you've said so far I feel

00:50:49.13 like we've gone into you've asked if they're a public figure and I said no

00:50:54.21 we have gone into that I will say that I met them through this show

00:50:59.12 you met them through the show and it was in season two

00:51:02.04 yes I believe so I should go back and confirm that I believe it was season two

00:51:06.16 met them through this show met them through this if uh if this show

00:51:10.16 didn't exist they would I would have never crossed paths with them oh what

00:51:15.14 about the guy um that slacked us which guy that was a guy

00:51:21.11 is it are you saying is it uh Greg from accounting yeah

00:51:25.18 is that your guess Greg from accounting is

00:51:28.19 an incorrect guess I wouldn't I wouldn't guess that because he doesn't work

00:51:34.04 through here anymore he he switched companies all uh yeah uh

00:51:37.23 that's why you don't hear from Greg from accounting anymore for like the last

00:51:42.02 year but that uh okay uh Greg from Greg not from accounting

00:51:46.11 Greg from other accounting uh

00:51:51.05 what was that I'm just I'm going to say I'm going like

00:51:54.22 jeopardy rules you need to be correct with the

00:51:58.03 I'm not not implying that that is the correct answer and you just phrased it

00:52:02.02 wrong but you need to be like as opposed to

00:52:05.11 incorrect yeah it needs to be you can't you have to have the name of the thing

00:52:10.10 correctly displayed the name of the thing or the person

00:52:14.06 why are you phrasing it like well okay so like if you guessed the

00:52:19.03 director from the tuxedo I would not accept that but if you said Kevin

00:52:23.12 Donovan I would accept that oh so you may be quick why was that not on

00:52:28.13 the guest list because we guessed him didn't we yeah we did

00:52:34.04 how uh it's a shitty list Eric hold on so I is

00:52:36.17 is it do we know do Gavin and I both know this person's name

00:52:40.07 you're allowed to get yeah we have to do

00:52:42.19 or do we have to do research to find out their name yeah well yeah

00:52:46.11 you both know well I don't know I mean you're saying yeah to a lot of stuff

00:52:49.09 here that's confusing the [ __ ] out of me yeah well I don't I don't know the

00:52:53.18 answer to that question I should yeah Geoff I will say this

00:52:57.19 [ __ ] well now I don't know what to do Eric can I have a ruling on this oh

00:53:03.07 consider what how do I how do I you you listen you worked

00:53:07.05 yourself into this corner but well no I feel no I feel like we've talked about

00:53:12.05 this I feel like under jeopardy rules I don't think they've got it right would

00:53:15.10 you agree don't I don't think we ever talked about jeopardy rules no but we've

00:53:21.05 talked about people have made guesses and it's like close but not exactly what

00:53:25.03 are we what's the rule surely if we've said the person and it's that person we

00:53:29.16 win but it's not you haven't technically said the person but this is where this

00:53:35.15 is where I can't listen I need to be not involved in this now because now

00:53:40.12 it's becoming an Andrew thing and I don't want anything to do no no no no no

00:53:46.10 no no no no no no no close in any way you know we might have it

00:53:51.05 I you are so close but not quite right but you're so my god

00:53:56.13 you have to separate me from this because now because because now this is

00:54:01.05 an Andrew thing I can't believe we're into this thing we've talked about this

00:54:05.12 we've talked about this you've agreed with this I don't want I don't want

00:54:09.09 anything you've agreed with

00:54:13.18 because now he's talking about jeopardy rules and all this other stuff

00:54:17.14 and I can't I can't be a part of this anymore well he's agreed already though

00:54:21.20 that's what I do okay let me ask you this okay when when we

00:54:26.04 said someone yep to you yup was that the person uh

00:54:30.21 in what context sorry what was what's that next to the [ __ ] contest what do

00:54:36.01 you mean what context did we guess the [ __ ] person

00:54:39.16 oh my god what a stupid thing to say well I don't know what you mean by that

00:54:43.15 you guessed

00:54:45.14 what what let's calm down calm down you got I'm

00:54:50.10 gonna I'm gonna rework what Gavin just asked me and explain it you've gotten

00:54:57.16 you've gotten the name right you haven't got

00:55:00.17 the name right you got the name right but not their actual role

00:55:06.17 if they were a character it would be like if you said

00:55:11.03 bat guy and you meant batman uh oh Greg from uh was he not an accountant

00:55:20.02 there's a specific title I'm searching slack great oh Greg

00:55:25.12 there's a lot of greg's that don't work here anymore

00:55:30.06 not that one I know that one is it that one no that one never talked

00:55:34.17 to me hold on uh what about this one no he's never said a word to me uh Greg

00:55:44.23 oh what about that one I you know this is pivoted I feel betrayed by Eric in

00:55:49.14 this moment I feel like this is going to

00:55:51.14 be oh really Andrew at this point uh you are this is a great betrayal but I want

00:55:56.15 to talk about being in the deep end of water you're you're treading man no

00:56:00.13 I am in a four foot hot tub and I can see the floor it is clear I am

00:56:05.09 comfortable I mean I know the dudes from finance and strategy

00:56:09.14 you got it you haven't got it Greg in finance oh god you are really

00:56:20.02 just said yes when I guessed Greg no you said Greg from accounting then I didn't

00:56:25.08 even say Greg I said that guy who slapped us you're the one who filled it into

00:56:30.04 Greg financing is the same [ __ ] thing what dude it's the same department in

00:56:34.21 the company different it's a different nickname

00:56:37.14 this is why this is why I couldn't be a part of it because I knew you got it

00:56:42.08 now now no no no no no no no no it's not let me

00:56:45.11 [ __ ] go into our slack chat cause Eric and I have talked I'm like so many

00:56:50.09 people have been so close but not exact and you're like yeah it's crazy

00:56:55.07 everyone's so close [Laughter]

00:56:58.00 would send the guesses to Greg that guessed him and then he would down vote them.

00:57:04.04 [Laughter]

00:57:05.20 Jesus Christ well how's Greg doing I don't I didn't know he didn't work at

00:57:11.04 the company anymore I know I'm having an issue with payroll or something go in

00:57:16.18 it's like are you in accounting no I'm in finance and you're like okay bye.

00:57:22.17 [Laughter]

00:57:22.17 I agree sorry I'm not Greg from payroll I'm Greg from accounting but I was

00:57:27.11 trying to be what do you guys do here in accounting we handle payroll oh geez

00:57:32.19 this is why I couldn't get on board with this Greg I'm like yeah they got it no

00:57:38.08 rules he wanted it to last no more episodes no it's not kidding if

00:57:42.19 I said you're trying to guess Greg again at that point like would you have ever

00:57:49.01 come back to that never no if I said [ __ ] no time out time out if I put a

00:57:54.06 poster a [ __ ] superman on the wall and I say who's that character and you

00:57:59.23 say super guy that's not correct that is an incorrect guess if I had to pick him

00:58:05.18 out of a lineup and you said super guy I'd probably think you were talking

00:58:09.10 about super bad if he was stood next to but you're making me do the leap you're

00:58:15.07 making me do that's not a correct guess that's the correct guess hey Geoff yeah

00:58:19.21 was this worth it no Greg and financing and Greg and accounting are the same

00:58:24.04 person we know we know that we know who that there it's the only

00:58:28.12 person who who filled that role with the name Greg in this company you are

00:58:33.00 arguing you are you are being pedantic right now and you are arguing semantics

00:58:37.20 he clearly clearly clearly clearly guessed the right

00:58:43.12 Andrew I wish there was something I wish we had a verb that was stronger than

00:58:48.21 salad cream like I was noticing that there was something above salad cream

00:58:54.15 for what you've just done not only to gather not only to I but to the entire

00:59:00.02 community first of all you're the biggest technicality guy I

00:59:04.02 know you're you're always go ogling the [ __ ] dictionary whenever anything
