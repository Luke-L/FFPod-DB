00:00:35.03 Hello and welcome to episode 58 I think is this 58

00:00:40.06 yeah is this yeah 58 a face what's everyone's favorite brand of honey mustard

00:00:46.20 I'll go first I really enjoy white spots I don't I know they're a restaurant

00:00:50.11 chain and not a brand they have a fantastic honey mustard Geoff

00:00:53.16 what is your favorite I'll be honest with you android I'm not

00:00:56.20 I don't like it wow I don't think I've ever bought it from

00:00:59.23 like like a brand at a store I've had it on yeah you know if I'm picking a sauce

00:01:03.22 in a restaurant maybe I'll wait but I don't ever like buy the whole

00:01:07.16 thing it's weird to me dude I like honey and I like mustard but together they

00:01:12.11 don't it doesn't it doesn't it's not a draw for me

00:01:16.19 I respect that you love it so much I really do

00:01:19.20 huh I do oh sh and nick has an answer he's got Texas

00:01:22.11 locked and loaded I yeah I don't know why I didn't immediately go to nick for

00:01:25.14 this Texas honey ham company can I get Texas honey ham company

00:01:30.00 seems pretty spicy let's see if I can order that

00:01:33.14 I mean I got salad cream do you know what I realized by the way

00:01:38.20 what did you realize we went around everyone

00:01:42.16 and did the soda chug burp challenge yeah I couldn't help but notice that

00:01:47.10 someone was absent

00:01:49.18 when we did that that's an excellent point so we're gonna need oh we're gonna

00:01:54.23 need to sort of round off this whole chapter of face today probably

00:01:59.11 I'm probably uh I'm gonna have to agree Eric thoughts yeah so how is nick gonna

00:02:06.10 do this nick already did it nick did it it was part of the chug okay

00:02:11.21 so then okay follow-up question can I fake it like Geoff or do I actually have

00:02:15.05 that I didn't fake it it's a great place I

00:02:17.20 told you it was gonna be a letdown if I did it because I've already proved that

00:02:20.23 I can do it easily why do people think you're faking it I

00:02:23.11 don't know because because there is okay so

00:02:25.22 Geoff's like I'm gonna chug it and then there's no and he says like I'm gonna

00:02:29.11 try to do this so you can hear it you hear nothing and then a few seconds

00:02:32.17 later he's like halfway through and then there's like a second of

00:02:36.23 nothing and then done well I assume nick's just cutting out

00:02:40.23 silence could be but I felt like even live

00:02:42.18 it was yeah see nick says true that's because I don't I don't make a lot of

00:02:45.22 noise I don't sound like a dying dinosaur when I drink like you do I'm sorry

00:02:51.14 oh nick nick couldn't hear the truth listen hold up

00:02:55.14 now I'm getting oh nick okay right nick if you can hear jack in the audio

00:03:00.23 when we couldn't hear jack that is damning evidence because I

00:03:04.05 was going to say the fact that we couldn't hear jack made me think that Geoff

00:03:07.12 did do it and we just couldn't hear it if you can hear jack in the audio

00:03:11.14 that to me indicates that Geoff didn't do the chuck I believe that Geoff fully did

00:03:14.10 it but I'm willing to continue on the path that he didn't just so he has to do

00:03:17.18 it again it sounds like he's gonna try it again

00:03:19.22 he definitely did it last week I I'm not sure about that the lack of audio

00:03:24.20 is fascinating [Laughter]

00:03:28.11 how much you were just getting you you were enjoying it so much

00:03:32.22 as we struggled to even chug it it was just like

00:03:36.03 well because you guys were making so much [ __ ] about how easy it was

00:03:40.12 and then it was a nightmare for everybody involved okay I I listen

00:03:44.10 I'm gonna do it again okay okay here listen to the [ __ ]

00:03:47.21 it's uh coke zero uh-huh listen listen for this can you hear that I'm gonna

00:03:51.01 open it did you hear that sounded real yeah definitely it splattered me in the

00:03:55.13 [ __ ] face all right so now I just I'm just gonna

00:03:58.21 drink it I'm gonna stop at some point to breathe

00:04:01.14 but I won't sounds like a sound effect why don't you produce

00:04:05.07 why don't you produce an audible hum so we'll know where you are in the stage of

00:04:09.01 drinking and breathing I'll try to turn on my camera

00:04:13.03 suck like my butt all right here we go here I'll take a [ __ ] photo I'll take

00:04:16.10 a [ __ ] photo right I mean that doesn't prove anything

00:04:19.08 we know you have a soda this the photo's useless

00:04:21.20 I don't all right here we go I'm gonna record this all right here we go I'm

00:04:24.20 gonna record it all right here we go okay let's uh here we go record I'm not

00:04:30.00 actually recording it's not like an action Bronson type thing uh and.

00:04:36.13 I mean already sounds worse than it did last time

00:04:40.00 oh I could hear it I can't hit the chug that time he's really making it count

00:04:45.01 there silence again all right it's gone that was really fast yeah I just did it

00:04:50.13 that was that was really quick oh oh no nick just said on a second

00:05:00.17 listen I can hear the chugging yeah Geoff you didn't have to do it god

00:05:06.00 I need to credit Eric with the masterful performance

00:05:09.12 of being asked to drink a soda and then having this happen that was a great

00:05:14.04 great move by Eric a great point in the move and but that only works if we just

00:05:19.07 move on and refuse to go back to Eric that's true but we don't do that we

00:05:23.15 no Eric uh you're up I don't I don't think I keep soda in the house I can

00:05:28.15 you try to who what do you mean you're an American

00:05:31.06 I don't drink I don't really drink soda I can try to what if what if I crush a

00:05:35.20 budweiser is that American like that's very American that's like all right

00:05:39.20 talk about something else and I'll try to I'll try to I'll go get a budweiser

00:05:44.02 real quick all right hang on I'll be right back

00:05:48.21 uh nick's right nick's right you could favorite or instacart it and it'd be

00:05:52.17 there in no time at all definitely before the end of the show we

00:05:55.18 can even vamp and run long yeah I can I can have my name at Dylan

00:06:00.23 this has got to go 50 houses or however the distance

00:06:04.11 god I'm trying to share this stupid video and I won't share on the discord

00:06:08.13 thing yeah well maybe we should save the Eric

00:06:12.06 chug for the finale go out on like half kind of set a tradition

00:06:16.11 nick said it might be sparkling water not a soda well I don't know what that

00:06:20.11 means yeah like I understand what those words mean well

00:06:24.10 I think as long as it's carbonated I think a sparkling water is

00:06:28.14 fizzier than a soda you do or you don't I do I would rather chug a soda than a

00:06:32.19 sparkling water I think if I knew the sparkling water would be even worse than

00:06:36.00 what I was doing that's what I was doing I was doing

00:06:39.01 sweet I don't drink soda wait this just dawned on me wasn't the thing

00:06:41.23 you're supposed to drink and then not burp

00:06:44.01 yeah it was a sparkling soda we've been wrong the entire time with soda it's

00:06:46.23 been completely off but didn't Geoff just drink it and then burp immediately

00:06:51.10 yeah I know he lost immediately but yeah yeah I gotta go 30 seconds

00:06:56.10 time to start yeah yeah I lost I just I just drank it

00:06:59.06 oh I didn't know I wasn't aware that that was an option no if we're doing

00:07:03.09 this right you need to chug two cans and then not burp for 30

00:07:06.09 seconds oh that's insane what an insane thing no

00:07:09.04 I'm not doing it it's totally totally doable I just don't have two cans left

00:07:12.18 that was my last year I think that's interesting everybody yelled at

00:07:16.15 me when I said I didn't have soda but just going no I don't have two

00:07:19.23 cans left I just drank one on camera well hang on you could insta cart it

00:07:24.19 real quick be here by the end of the show need to because I've already

00:07:30.09 done it twice now you did one well Eric just do your bud crush your

00:07:35.04 bird Eric oh yeah oh is he doing cam yeah I'll turn on a little camera for you

00:07:40.12 okay here we go uh it's budweiser king of beers

00:07:45.17 uh this is uh the america can so mm-hmm I also don't think I can do this like I

00:07:51.16 guess I'll try yeah like what me what is a chug I feel

00:07:55.05 like you can't remove the can from your yeah yeah but you can

00:07:59.01 pause all right I haven't done this since college cheers to you

00:08:02.15 look at him bragging about going to college

00:08:05.20 did you go to college for the globe rate he's glad no I did not go to college

00:08:11.07 Gavin did you go to college no well I went to sixth floor

00:08:15.09 me either I didn't even go to sixth form all right it's down

00:08:18.09 30 seconds it's not burped yet he looks good in the mic Eric get in get through

00:08:22.12 the mic we need to hear the suffering he does not look good he's shaking his

00:08:27.14 hands shaking it out I think he's like true no Geoff might be

00:08:31.18 right yeah you lose the no oh no I lost it I felt it it went back

00:08:36.09 down and now my stomach's even worse I don't know that I can burp

00:08:46.10 oh Jesus Christ

00:08:50.04 that's the first time I think I've chugged a budweiser without popping it

00:08:54.08 with a key and then slamming it

00:08:58.13 when was the last time you did that uh 2008

00:09:05.12 oh by the way did I tell you Eric I I have a hard out after the uh the break

00:09:10.10 [ __ ]

00:09:12.00 You have a heart oh I think we both have

00:09:14.00 the same heart out I was going to ask if it's

00:09:16.10 your heart out as well oh it's I we have the exact same heart out

00:09:22.00 what's what's your heart out we have a group that sees movies

00:09:26.08 that had to take a break for a while but now we're back in full force

00:09:32.03 and it's an insane group of people so we went and saw hobbs and Shaw I got

00:09:37.01 asked by tim g tpg from sales and he went

00:09:41.22 bro you [ __ ] with hobbs and Shaw and I said [Music]

00:09:46.13 And I said I guess so and he said you [ __ ] with

00:09:50.02 d-box and I said I don't know what that is and he said

00:09:54.02 d-box hobbs and Shaw and I said okay so I show up to a movie theater

00:10:00.04 myself tim g meg and Gavin and that's the group

00:10:07.01 so tim g hit me up earlier this week or last week and he said

00:10:11.22 bro I can't wait to [ __ ] with fast nine and I said let's do it he said

00:10:17.07 d-box and I said let's [ __ ] do it and he said I'm getting the crew back

00:10:21.14 together the d-box crew is [ __ ] baby it's I'm so not excited it's the d-box

00:10:28.19 family you guys are honoring them straight up is perfect like right after we do

00:10:34.23 break [ __ ] we are like going and seeing [ __ ] fast and furious

00:10:46.04 tim g I don't know it's been it's been a few years it's been a few

00:10:50.19 I'm I'm I'm like legitimately excited I'm so jealous

00:10:54.23 this is like a great experience it sounds like an awesome time

00:10:59.10 I've actually seen every first movie in d-box

00:11:02.22 since I moved to this country in 2012.

00:11:05.01 And the first time was probably the roughest because

00:11:08.01 I I think I'd eaten something a little bit gammy earlier in the day

00:11:11.09 was that with ben no I think it was with Michael and Lindsey uh I saw fast five

00:11:15.15 in d-box I think with ben yeah I think that was a little bit

00:11:18.20 earlier that was probably before I moved here

00:11:21.20 but I I I think I ate some gammy trudies or something or I had too many

00:11:25.06 frozen margaritas or something but I sat down and it did the little d-box

00:11:30.06 trailer where it's like ah this is what these seats do and they're like shut

00:11:33.11 the [ __ ] up and then I was just like I have to go and throw up before this

00:11:39.01 movie starts because I was about to hurl in my seat I ran

00:11:42.22 well like right before the movie started I ran through up and came back and it

00:11:46.08 was awesome it was great before we get too far away

00:11:49.12 I have some questions I need to ask Gavin did you receive the same pitch the

00:11:53.20 kimchi come to you and say do you [ __ ]

00:11:56.00 with hobsonshot was it the same intro how did you get recruited into the

00:11:59.21 family well I want to say that because I was already I'd already had my

00:12:03.22 perfect record of fast movies in d-box I think he was

00:12:07.16 trying to seed hobbs and Shaw and I recommended d-box and then he

00:12:11.02 passed that on to Eric and now it's just become the crew

00:12:14.04 but how did okay I guess I don't see how he becomes involved in it at that point

00:12:19.12 he seems like the dom toretto of this d-box family

00:12:22.02 um and it's you're making it sound like he was an addition like you're doing

00:12:25.12 this regardless and you just happened across but that's the thing here's the

00:12:31.03 here's the thing fast and furious is a group of people who were already

00:12:35.18 doing a lot of different things that have come together

00:12:39.11 and now they are secret agents uh so that's kind of what we're doing

00:12:44.10 we're all doing different stuff I'm kind of like the ludicrous of this

00:12:48.08 whole thing okay definitely like been around

00:12:51.16 but also you go but really what's he doing here

00:12:55.09 so I feel good in my role was it was it tpg last time who took the poster

00:13:03.05 yeah oh he was so excited about a free poster it was I just like that

00:13:08.01 I like that this crew that's getting back together has never

00:13:13.03 once hung out outside of a fast movie that we have literally never all been in

00:13:18.10 the same place again you can't time the only time we've hung out

00:13:23.22 is the one time seeing that other movie the coven happened and tim went

00:13:29.07 bro you [ __ ] fast nine it's going to be so good I'm excited I'm

00:13:36.10 so excited we're going to open a bunch of cards

00:13:39.18 and then we're going to go shaking around yeah

00:13:42.18 we're going to open cards I'll quickly go make myself throw up and then we'll

00:13:47.01 head out I'm curious how many other people got invited to the d-box family

00:13:51.18 this is a great thing I I hope it expands sounds like a pretty exclusive club I

00:13:56.09 can't wait for one of you to die and then come back

00:13:59.02 two years later I got invited to the Sunday overflow event with Alfredo

00:14:03.05 so I'll be seeing it there I'm going to that one too so I'll see you there

00:14:08.04 everyone could swell [Laughter]

00:14:10.21 because then we saw Alfredo at a bar and I bought coronas

00:14:15.12 and I just went it's family and then we felt really good about it

00:14:19.22 what I it's interesting you called them agents I don't know what I'd categorize

00:14:24.12 the crew as I feel like they're a bit are they a family business

00:14:29.05 technically like what well they think they've registered a company

00:14:34.04 I don't I think they're a family business technically

00:14:36.21 I think I was watching fast six no fast seven on a plane and there was

00:14:41.21 one point where this girl like gave them information and uh

00:14:46.06 they were like oh the our other team would have tortured you for that

00:14:50.02 information and she's like I don't trust that team I trust you

00:14:54.02 and I'm like they've gotten so big they have teams

00:14:57.03 within their team that's insane that's crazy we've witnessed the

00:15:01.13 expansion the first movie was about racing it was about stealing vcrs

00:15:06.17 that was like the big heist of the first movie we've come a long way

00:15:12.00 this is how governments are born can you imagine how bummed people would

00:15:17.11 be if foss9 was just a racing movie

00:15:22.06 it's like a weird gi joe thing now like he's got a metal suit I'm excited I want

00:15:26.20 to see you fast night now you've you've excited me about these

00:15:29.16 movies I mean they're great movies to begin with

00:15:31.19 have you played any of the games for faster theories uh yeah

00:15:36.04 Geoff and I made a video I think in uh yeah we played phosphate

00:15:39.10 five yeah oh the one that doesn't have like it's what is it like Tyrese and

00:15:43.08 ludicrous and Paul walker are like the playable characters like

00:15:46.18 vin diesel I don't think is in that game I don't remember I just

00:15:50.17 remember it was trash it was really not it was really

00:15:54.07 bad the only good fast game was like the forza tie-in and it's not even really

00:15:58.03 like it's just the cars but like the narrative they put out a

00:16:02.12 new one like a year ago that I haven't played

00:16:05.11 that I own that I'm excited to speaking of uh gi

00:16:08.21 joe and how much enjoyment we got out of Sweden

00:16:10.23 uh rutabaga do you know what the English version of gi joe is called

00:16:15.03 I feel like when you say it I'll recognize it but I could not

00:16:19.02 pull it like I couldn't just say it right now but I'll be what it is yeah

00:16:22.00 that's correct action man

00:16:28.13 so wait are they the action men no just action man

00:16:32.02 and I think that's like an action it's like another action team I guess

00:16:37.14 I don't know but it's gi joe it's like scarlet and

00:16:39.20 hawk and hawkeye I don't know I think it's just like a British spin-off and he

00:16:43.05 has like real hair oh it's just like spin-off

00:16:46.04 it's not even a real I thought you're saying that's what it was called

00:16:49.09 I thought it was like the cartoons like like you have teenage mutant hero

00:16:53.03 turtles action man action man yeah well it's just like the dolls and stuff

00:16:58.02 I'm so confused by you you somehow made this more confusing yeah so what was

00:17:02.23 when you watched g.i joe the cartoon in england what was it called action man

00:17:06.06 the cartoon I didn't see gi joe I don't know great I just had actually

00:17:10.19 this is like my without gi is that what you want from me

00:17:16.02 was it Leona waddell the basket weaver where like I knew one thing about her

00:17:21.05 and this is yours that you know one thing

00:17:23.10 and you have no other information about action man I don't know look up action

00:17:27.12 man I'm pretty sure it's the same thing kinda mostly well it's

00:17:30.22 you're saying it's exactly the same thing

00:17:32.18 those are two very different things if it's not the same thing if it's not the

00:17:37.03 same thing you just told me that there's a thing in the Europe called

00:17:40.10 action man yeah but the whole point was that it was a [ __ ] gi joe thing and I

00:17:45.12 don't think it is I think it's just an action man I don't think it is I

00:17:50.21 looked up action man right now it is a Canadian it appears um tv series

00:17:55.22 Australia let me I'm going to into the wiki 2000

00:18:00.01 action man tv series I feel like I owned an action figure for the axeman maxima

00:18:04.15 is his name max the show is unrelated to the 1995 show

00:18:07.21 is that what you're referring to action man is an action figure launched

00:18:13.01 in britain in 1966 by blah blah blah as a licensed copy of hasbro's American

00:18:18.10 movable fighting man gi joe so it's a variation it's not uh

00:18:22.22 because it's licensed by so it's I guess technically the same but it's

00:18:27.01 different or maybe they're just using the same pieces

00:18:30.04 I don't know look now I'm worried that it's nothing to do with that

00:18:33.03 with gi joe but it looks like it kind of is well it's I've I feel like

00:18:36.18 somebody called an action man would fit under the gi joe umbrella as far as like

00:18:40.21 what that content would be action man and gi joe the same

00:18:45.04 we had rescue heroes when I was growing up was r like gi joe equivalent

00:18:50.15 but imagine do you remember the psas in gi joe of like

00:18:53.00 don't [ __ ] leave the stove on yeah I've only seen like the funny redubbed

00:18:57.01 ones from yeah the golden age of the internet rescue heroes was

00:19:01.10 if they made gi joe but it was only the psas

00:19:04.14 it was just like here's a group of like kind of not really soldiers but like

00:19:08.23 firefighters and ambulance people and they're superheroes

00:19:11.11 they're gonna stop a fire or like there's a tsunami coming in it was not

00:19:17.05 it's not really thrilling was uh was that Canadian

00:19:20.13 produced it was yeah I want to say it was a Canadian cartoon

00:19:25.12 action man it's a licensed copy of hasbros so I guess it's the same as it's the

00:19:30.19 same as the gi joe doll but it's not in the gi joe universe

00:19:35.18 that makes sense I think they just took the doll and renamed it so it's

00:19:39.00 not yeah yeah no I think it's his own separate thing from what I could tell

00:19:43.04 what does gi even stand for general issue or government issue fat play game

00:21:43.16 you'll take it on speakerphone on the bus that's what you're doing if you're

00:21:47.03 not using something like expressvpn because isps like com cast or verizon

00:21:51.12 they know every single website you visit because

00:21:54.13 internet service providers and I'm not going to name them you know who they are

00:21:57.18 you pay for one of them they know every single website you visit

00:22:02.02 isps can then sell this information to ad companies and tech

00:22:06.08 giants who then use your data to target you

00:22:10.06 with very cleverly disguised ads for oh I don't know uh decorative spoons and

00:22:46.12 I like expressvpn most because when I'm thimbling as we call it I like to do it

00:22:50.10 in private I don't want big thimble or big spoon spying on me I like to keep my

00:22:55.18 transactions in the ceramic and collectible uh market

00:23:18.00 face Geoff you're a chain guy what's up apparently you're a chain guy apparently

00:23:25.05 that's what I said when you told me your chain guy what does that mean

00:23:29.12 I'm a chain guy now I bought a chain and I wear it and I like it

00:23:33.10 now I'm a train guy you're a necklace guy yeah I bought a chain I bought like a

00:23:38.04 gold chain and I've been wearing it to test it out and see if I like wearing a

00:23:41.18 chain and I do and then I uh I've discovered that I quite enjoy

00:23:45.20 chains and I'm a chain guy oh this chain is a

00:23:49.11 Cuban link chain and I quite enjoy it I think I might get another chain can we

00:23:54.01 see a picture of this chain I'd love to see a photo of the chain and

00:23:57.00 I want to say that when Geoff said I'm a chain guy

00:23:59.15 I bought a chain and I'm not wearing it I immediately went to like rampage

00:24:03.16 Jackson chain level I didn't think Geoff met like a necklace

00:24:07.07 I thought I'll drop it in the discord I thought Geoff was going full

00:24:11.10 rampage Jackson and I was all about it I was very excited to see you

00:24:15.12 walking around I thought it was gonna be like.

00:24:20.17 Andrew I might be going in that direction I mean like I'm not you don't

00:24:26.06 nobody starts out as me it's the same thing those photos are identical

00:24:32.00 yeah right oh I feel pretty that looks like who wore it better huh who wore it

00:24:40.08 better looks like a chain from Tiffany that's just a chain it's like a guy's

00:24:46.21 chain you don't got even anything on it are

00:24:50.10 you not going to put like a pendant or something

00:24:54.17 like a gem like a like a charm no I got it I got it on the internet or a lot

00:24:59.11 and I got it Emily

00:25:03.07 no no just the chain just the chain I might get a bigger one though

00:25:08.11 you should absolutely get a bigger one I don't know

00:25:12.01 get one as large as rampages but I I I would like to add I I would like to at

00:25:15.22 some point get to a I'd like to have enough chains where it's an issue with you

00:25:21.06 oh sorry do you wear this to bed do you sleep in this chain

00:25:24.10 yeah you just live in it that you don't take them off because their heart is

00:25:28.06 [ __ ] to take on and off so it's just on me 24 hours a day I've

00:25:31.16 been wearing it for about a month now and I'm digging it yeah usually keep it

00:25:36.11 usually keep it tucked under the shirt so it's subtle you don't see it a lot

00:25:40.03 Gavin for instance we we spent an entire soccer game together you had no idea I

00:25:44.06 was rocking a chain you were wearing that then every second

00:25:47.18 there's no way I gotta look at a selfie there's no way

00:25:50.11 look at the selfie there'll be a chain around my neck it's probably tucked in

00:25:53.14 my shirt but you'll still be able to see oh I

00:25:55.14 I guess I didn't take a picture with you I just took one with Millie

00:26:00.06 well that makes sense I'm I'm happy that you're a chain guy Geoff

00:26:05.05 but I gotta say this is like the most disappointing version

00:26:09.14 of that lead-in I I didn't mean to disappoint you

00:26:13.02 I'm not sure how else I should have should have presented it to you

00:26:17.01 I used language that gav that Andrew specifically would understand

00:26:20.23 Andrew the I'm a blank guy so I said I'm a chain guy

00:26:23.22 I was trying to speak to you in your vernacular you do appear to be a chain

00:26:27.11 guy oh while I was looking for that picture

00:26:29.12 I found the picture I took of jack at that football game by the way

00:26:34.15 that is definitely jack you have no idea how far away that actually was from us

00:26:40.10 that's the that's really we we took a bunch of pictures and then we zoomed in

00:26:46.00 and uh for about 30 minutes trying to find jack until we finally did

00:26:50.06 since you are you're a chain guy Geoff can I suggest some chains to you

00:26:54.07 so maybe some things to add to your please do your collection okay so I'm

00:26:58.00 gonna go first of all with uh the classic stylish

00:27:02.00 it's been around forever maybe a nice squidward

00:27:06.00 gold that looks expensive it's not it's like a hundred dollars

00:27:10.13 oh that's also Patrick you're right star that's Patrick I was wildly inaccurate

00:27:16.10 uh what about uh rocket power you fan of rocket power don't know that

00:27:21.01 you do rocket power look at them on a skateboard you like the skateboard

00:27:24.04 do you like skateboards I'm not familiar with that brand that's pretty cool

00:27:28.04 though yeah those are top two the last one I

00:27:31.05 have not a necklace but maybe you want to expand are you a ring guy

00:27:35.00 are you in the rings not yet well now you can be because a big achievement fan

00:27:40.06 achievement hunter has got to be stylish with Xbox you got to be

00:27:45.02 rounded out that seems more like an Eric than me but I like it

00:27:49.20 if you would have posted you wearing that Patrick chain I would have been all

00:27:54.13 about it I might do it who knows yeah I'd support it you got to

00:27:58.06 work your way up to it I feel like a chain is something you work your way

00:28:01.12 up to you got to build the kind of confidence and the kind of

00:28:04.18 presence that allows one to have a chain I don't think you just like you don't

00:28:08.02 just walk out of the store yeah looking like rampage Jackson I

00:28:11.09 don't understand the path to that though like who did you see with

00:28:14.19 a chain and then you thought yeah that's me you didn't just think I'm

00:28:18.12 gonna get a chain I was thinking about mr t yeah I was

00:28:22.06 thinking about how cool mr t was really when I was a kid and then

00:28:26.14 I was thinking about uh like how I always wanted to be like mr t and then I

00:28:30.19 thought well mr t and I was like he wore a lot of jewelry

00:28:33.18 and I was like why don't I wear jewelry and then I looked and I have you know I

00:28:37.09 wear I've always worn a rubber band and I have my fart bracelet and then I

00:28:41.03 thought like well my wrists are pretty full

00:28:43.01 I can't get an ankle bracelet that would be weird the only thing left is I only

00:28:46.12 the only other stick I have just to put something around is my neck

00:28:49.21 so I said [ __ ] it I'll be a little baby mr t how are you going to incorporate

00:28:53.14 snacks onto the necklace that's yes exactly that's another question

00:28:57.16 right it's like here I am designing edible jewelry

00:29:02.12 yet I don't wear jewelry so I can only assume that over time

00:29:07.09 I will uh I will glean some insights that will help

00:29:11.05 this is like gateway jewelry yeah yeah right like you gotta you gotta live it

00:29:16.18 to understand it to sell it what do you have to do to become someone who wears

00:29:21.07 two chinks what is the elevation to that because I

00:29:24.13 assume your next chain will be swapped if you're saying like building up the

00:29:27.23 chain line I don't know how do you achieve

00:29:30.06 two levels of change I honestly don't know I'm worried I'm just worried about

00:29:33.07 you the amount that you fall off your bike

00:29:35.15 I'm worried that that's gonna get caught on something

00:29:38.17 and you're gonna be just hanging from a bridge by your chin

00:29:41.14 speaking of falling off my bike though I did not fall off my bike today

00:29:46.15 thank god that's it that's your story you didn't well

00:29:50.04 yeah well I I've been working on a new trick and uh okay today was the day

00:29:56.04 and I didn't fall I made I did my trick what is the trick all right did you

00:30:00.03 record it is there video of the trick no no no there's no video but so like uh

00:30:04.03 you know when I ride my bike I have my my route that I go

00:30:07.01 and there are some spots that I like to do in the bike rides yeah the bike rides

00:30:10.12 I like to do some fun stuff like the the area where I uh I go up the side of the

00:30:14.21 the hill uh or the ball where I crashed in the snow

00:30:18.01 you still do that huh oh yeah I still do it now I'll be honest with you

00:30:22.04 I'll be honest with you it took me a while to to feel okay doing it again

00:30:26.17 and then I did a baby's for a while uh and now I'm back to doing it now I'm

00:30:30.13 back to bombing at full speed again so there's this other area where

00:30:35.03 you come out of a tunnel and immediately it takes a hard right up a hill

00:30:39.20 but uh on the left is like a wall kind of like a

00:30:43.05 a leveled embankment kind of like the one that I wreck on but this one

00:30:47.16 it wraps away so it's like convex a little bit right

00:30:50.05 and this this wall frustrates me because it it's very inviting

00:30:55.09 to ride a bicycle up you but because of the way it's convex

00:30:59.18 it's very easy to lose your right your rear tire and have it

00:31:03.07 spin out from under you and cause you to wreck and that I would say

00:31:08.00 that happens probably seven out of ten times I try to uh navigate this thing

00:31:12.11 uh it's pretty common that I that I my tire spins out

00:31:15.16 the problem is is like you come out of this tunnel and then you make an

00:31:18.23 immediate right turn if you go straight where the right turn

00:31:21.21 is that's a bridge over a culvert like a drainage ditch that

00:31:25.05 goes about four feet down so if you hit this if you come out of

00:31:29.02 tunnel and you hit this wall to the left and right up it

00:31:32.10 it's impossible to turn around and come down fast enough to make

00:31:35.17 the path you will either do one of two things you'll either fall right off of

00:31:38.23 it and take the four foot plunge which I've done that's not fun

00:31:43.06 uh you'll miss it go down the fourth that just misses you right on the area

00:31:46.19 and then slam into the wall at about elbow length and that sucks but I realized

00:31:52.15 today that if you just keep writing a little bit no I didn't realize I

00:31:55.23 realized recently I was able to do it today that if you keep

00:31:59.18 going a little bit on that wall and then you just go down into the culvert

00:32:03.15 you can there's a lip on the other side that's pretty tall

00:32:07.03 but if you hit it fast enough you can jump it

00:32:10.01 and then land on the path and then keep going in theory right

00:32:13.19 now the problem with that is you got to hit that thing at speed

00:32:18.04 um and you got to build that speed up going higher up on this embankment

00:32:21.14 and then swinging back around bombing that and then you got to hit it hard

00:32:25.05 enough because it's the top it's like a it's like a teeter-totter

00:32:29.11 and there's no like it's a real sharp berm and you have to jump it

00:32:32.15 in theory and then table do like a bunny hop over it or

00:32:35.22 the bottom of the bike will definitely drag and you will fall

00:32:39.09 I know that because I tried this at quarter speed uh like a week ago

00:32:43.06 and uh that's where I wrecked then I tried it at half speed

00:32:46.17 and that's where I wrecked and then I tried it at half speed again and I

00:32:49.22 wrecked in a different place and there so I've done this a few times and I

00:32:54.13 realized that the only way to do it successfully

00:32:56.22 is uh is to do it at speed and today today I said [ __ ] it

00:33:00.21 uh I don't have to go to town for a couple days so I can handle a bruise or

00:33:05.13 a scab and so I I just [ __ ] hit it I hit it full speed and I was like who

00:33:10.06 knows what's gonna happen and I jumped the [ __ ] out of it it was awesome

00:33:14.05 it was like a movie it was like rad and gleaming the cube all at once I

00:33:18.04 [ __ ] I was I was seven feet tall and I had a giant

00:33:21.09 penis by the end of it it was amazing I couldn't believe I did it

00:33:24.14 what if we cut a sick trailer for face I'll bring the phantom

00:33:28.07 and we'll film you do that how much air is involved

00:33:31.03 Emily has been trying to get me to cut a trailer where I just spin that on my

00:33:34.12 bike and go like face break [ __ ] and then I haven't

00:33:37.01 gotten around to doing it but I think it's a great idea I I also think

00:33:40.03 that you would look at it and go like that's not hard at all but it's been

00:33:43.07 hard it's hard for me hard for a 46 year old dude

00:33:45.15 requires a lot of coordination requires a lot of sketchy [ __ ] I've already

00:33:48.17 wrecked my bike like a hole but what's hard if you're not actually like

00:33:52.16 I assume you're not pedaling yeah yeah you got a pedal to build up speed then

00:33:55.16 you got to ride you got to ride up the side of this wall

00:33:58.12 high enough then navigate down and like I said it's convex so the back tire

00:34:01.23 really wants to swing out from under you which when that happens

00:34:04.21 you're eight and a half feet in the air falling backwards down a concrete

00:34:08.06 embankment with your bike going on top of you uh been there not great

00:34:13.03 uh it's it's a lot to put together uh especially at my advanced stage I'll be

00:34:16.06 honest I I listened to everything you said and

00:34:18.00 I was listening to you know the stuff about the culverts and the berms and

00:34:21.05 stuff I if you asked me to draw a diagram of what you actually did I would have

00:34:26.00 absolutely no idea at all I wouldn't even know where to start at what this

00:34:29.12 looks like from like a bystander's point of view

00:34:32.13 I'll take a picture next time I'm there and then I can

00:34:35.05 draw the pat the I can draw the path how about that I

00:34:38.05 I would love to see the video shoot of this I think it'd be a great trailer

00:34:41.11 Andrew you listen to all that right I did I yeah I listened I have no idea

00:34:46.10 if you had to draw that what what would you put I

00:34:48.20 it would be a wall and then like I don't know what I'd do

00:34:52.00 a wall that you can ride up yeah so it'd be like kind of a sidewall I guess

00:34:56.00 and then a loop and it sounds like your trick is just ollying

00:34:59.10 if that's what no the trick is you ride on the wall no the trick is you come out

00:35:03.09 of a turn immediately ride up take out left right up a wall

00:35:07.16 go about eight feet in the air up on the wall to come down the wall

00:35:11.19 then bomb a hit Obama culvert and then go up the other side and then jump it

00:35:15.18 and uh sounds kind of imagining like a uh like a ball Gavin you know like a

00:35:20.00 skateboard like he's going up and then down it's

00:35:23.02 like transitioning into a half pipe kind of

00:35:27.07 I don't feel like I and then I can't imagine

00:35:29.15 I feel like it's less impressive we're gonna I'm gonna have to come out and

00:35:32.22 film this I need to see what's going on I I just yeah I don't understand what

00:35:37.01 exactly how this works and I don't you seem to be applying like your way to

00:35:40.22 generate speed as part of the trick and I don't

00:35:43.12 feel like that's the trick I feel like the trick is landing

00:35:46.15 the air gap that you make the air is the most the wall thing

00:35:49.20 difficult part the wall thing's a little sketchy too I think listen if you'd

00:35:53.03 wrecked on that wall as many times as I have

00:35:53.12 you'd have a healthy fear of it that's fair but hey you look good doing it with

00:35:57.11 your chain look fantastic well yeah I I hadn't

00:36:00.21 considered that but I appreciate that thank you yeah

00:36:03.14 I do look good I cannot wait for Geoff to be pulled by his automated

00:36:08.04 bike when his chain gets caught in the sprockets

00:36:11.07 some woman's just gonna be delivering cucumbers to the next house to see Geoff

00:36:16.21 g drag down the street if that were to happen I hope to god somebody films it

00:36:22.06 not just a guy being pulled by a bike with no one on it

00:36:28.19 but he's doing all the work just putting all that effort into that bike

00:36:33.21 it's it's barely assisting at all yeah I want to make that trailer that sounds

00:36:36.21 good well let's do it I'm all about it dude

00:36:40.02 I've been practicing this trip for a while

00:36:42.02 trick for a while it's not too far from where you yeah it's

00:36:45.04 uh easy for you to get to gab pretty sunny this weekend

00:36:48.05 I'm [ __ ] I'll be hitting that I hit it I'll be hitting that I'll be doing

00:36:51.16 that trick every day between now and uh until I probably until I wreck and

00:36:55.22 then I talk myself I'll just go to that spot

00:36:59.06 you could just continue your bike ride I'll just grab the shot and you just

00:37:02.17 carry on just say hi the problem is is now that I've done it successfully once

00:37:08.17 uh I feel like I can I'll have to do it every time

00:37:11.16 and then I'll just get then I'll just get braver and braver and faster and

00:37:14.17 faster and then that's when it gets worse are you the kind of person that when

00:37:18.18 when someone's filming you are you the kind of person who had hit it with even

00:37:22.10 more speed or would you get nervous and slow down because there's two types

00:37:26.04 of people I would over compensate by hitting it with more speed

00:37:29.07 that's what I thought yeah that's what I thought yeah

00:37:30.13 what were you gonna say Andrew I was just hoping that you guys can do this

00:37:34.04 this weekend I'm now my I'm excited if that is really

00:37:37.15 in play or is this happening this weekend

00:37:40.04 well if we grab the phantom bring it out there I think we could do it

00:37:44.03 I [ __ ] yeah this should happen I I I will

00:37:46.22 I can't wait by the way I'm excited we were supposed to you were supposed to

00:37:48.21 invite me over to go swimming this week and midweek it's Thursday you never did

00:37:52.19 that uh what I just remembered I just remembered just now oh I had

00:37:58.23 other people over again god damn it the chances are I know those people and

00:38:06.10 they probably like me [Laughter]

00:38:12.04 sounds like maybe Gavin doesn't like you I no that's that's that's yeah

00:38:18.12 it was meant to be a midweek hang on Andrew I'm starting to pick up on the

00:38:23.07 idea that maybe Gavin doesn't like me it's it's it's it's taking it a while to

00:38:27.18 sink in but it's becoming unavoidably clear no not remotely true I

00:38:32.03 think no this is what happened you were like

00:38:35.08 you asked me are you free on Thursday and I said but you're not

00:38:39.07 because we're doing this and you're like oh no I said are you free on Wednesday

00:38:42.22 because emily's off on Wednesday and that'd be the best day and you're like

00:38:46.00 yeah and I said okay just let us know and

00:38:47.05 you're like yeah all right I'll invite some other people over and then we'll

00:38:50.06 have fun and then suck my butt yeah I messed that up

00:38:55.02 I watched that didn't I I will say Geoff I don't think you need to be worried

00:38:59.02 I don't expect our friendship to exist outside of the recordings of this

00:39:02.04 podcast I I would say tomorrow but we've got a

00:39:04.12 break [ __ I and we've got a and we've got a d-box

00:39:06.22 and you got yeah you got other people I get it you box family yeah

00:39:10.15 I don't think you should be worried Geoff

00:39:13.07 until Gavin invites me ahead of you then you've got a problem

00:39:16.04 when I'm getting an out of country invite you you wouldn't come though

00:39:19.10 even if you even if he did and you came I wouldn't find out about it for like

00:39:22.15 six months anyway it's cool if you invited me in a non-coveted world

00:39:25.17 if you invited me to a lunch on let's say a Thursday and it was

00:39:29.12 a Monday and I got the invite I would I would make that lunch so post covered

00:39:34.08 I can give you three days notice for an invite in Austin and you'll be there

00:39:37.22 I'll be there that's dangerous you don't think I'm gonna test I'm gonna test the

00:39:42.02 [ __ ]

00:39:43.22 Out of that yeah but then if I don't go I don't lose anything when is post

00:39:47.09 coving 2025 that's a great that's a great point yeah

00:39:50.23 six years from now do you know that Andrew texted me the other day and he

00:39:54.23 said he missed outskirts I did I not even okay so

00:39:58.06 this goes deeper than Gavin even realizes oh

00:40:01.07 I was just so I had the whole property brothers thing and they've done stuff to

00:40:05.16 that app that is crazy that I don't need

00:40:07.11 to get into but it's just they made some bizarre

00:40:11.07 decisions on how that thing works got some more pay to win

00:40:14.06 it's less pay to win okay so I didn't plan on getting into it but so how you

00:40:18.05 play property brothers if you don't want to spend money

00:40:20.14 is whenever you fully upgrade a house you get one hour of unlimited plays if

00:40:24.15 you don't do that you have to wait for your energy to fill

00:40:26.10 so you'd have to be really smart with like timing okay I'm gonna upgrade this

00:40:30.02 house then I have one hour to make as much

00:40:32.13 cash as I can to upgrade the next house so I could try to chain it so I'm not

00:40:36.08 having to wait for my thing to recharge I didn't really notice this there were

00:40:39.21 no ads in that game like typically when you play a free

00:40:43.12 mobile game you're constantly getting video ads they had none

00:40:48.10 they finally added them but what happens is you can either watch an

00:40:51.12 ad to like gain energy or when you play a level if you don't beat

00:40:55.12 it they give you an option of end the level

00:40:59.03 or pay money to keep playing like five more turns

00:41:01.20 or watch this ad and get two more turns so I was like I can finish this in two

00:41:06.00 more turns I'll watch this ad I do it I failed I couldn't beat it

00:41:09.18 then I got the same prompt you can watch as many

00:41:12.17 ads as you want and just keep playing the level you will never lose as long as

00:41:17.05 you're willing to watch an ad you get two more turns I did it for eight turns

00:41:23.03 you watched a ads I watched four ads oh I got two turns per ad

00:41:27.07 I watched four ads did eight turns beat the level

00:41:29.11 but it has completely ruined their micro transaction system which is crazy to me

00:41:33.16 because we can't get money off the ads but you I just

00:41:37.03 feel like they would be I've never played a mobile game where you can't lose

00:41:42.02 and they've also completely negated the reason

00:41:43.23 for they make money I don't know what why don't you see that I understand what

00:41:46.23 you're saying no I I get it but it's just such an odd

00:41:49.17 way to do it like why even have the entire store they've rendered pointless

00:41:54.00 I'm just I have to watch a 15-second ad it's like they've given up on selling

00:41:56.23 things that's what it's interesting about it

00:41:59.07 I've never seen a mobile game do that maybe no one was doing the micro

00:42:02.02 transactions that's yeah I think that's logically

00:42:05.07 probably what happened but I've never seen a game just declare like

00:42:08.12 we our store is pointless do not spend money here just

00:42:11.19 watch these ads keep playing so I've moved on to there's a Gordon ramsay

00:42:16.05 mobile game called like chef's blast and this is this is a weird thing so

00:42:19.21 it's playing that and he does a surprising amount of voice work for it

00:42:24.03 um so I was like this is ridiculous you're solving puzzles

00:42:27.06 you're unlocking recipes I think I could go two weeks just with the recipes

00:42:30.17 I've unlocked is a weird kind of just random challenge idea I had

00:42:34.07 but I'm playing this and so I shared it as a joke I like tweeted about it

00:42:38.12 and then I made a team for it so I posted in the discord like hey anyone

00:42:43.01 who wants to join my Gordon ramsay chef blast team this is what you search for

00:42:48.14 and I woke up later and a bunch of people join

00:42:51.22 and there's a leader board for the team thing and it became super competitive

00:42:56.01 and I ended up spending my whole weekend playing chef's blast

00:43:00.13 I cleared a hundred puzzle levels in the first day and it just kept going

00:43:04.08 just everyone got super into it and I realized part of that

00:43:07.16 is that I missed doing outskirts like I needed something competitive to fill

00:43:12.00 that spot in my life and it turned into Gordon ramsay chef

00:43:14.23 blast people have gotten mild they've beaten the game there's like 480

00:43:20.02 levels to chef blast somebody beat it like it's absurd

00:43:22.18 how into it everybody got but it just turned into this is a joke to waking up

00:43:26.17 of like this is now the most important thing in my life

00:43:29.05 and I'm actually doing this because I miss outskirts as crazy as that

00:43:32.21 there was something so special about outskirts from my perspective because

00:43:38.08 I really loved your streams it was it was like my favorite tv show

00:43:41.08 of the week but imagine if to get your tv show to come on you had to play halo

00:43:46.11 better than the tv show could and then the tv show comes on

00:43:49.14 and then I'm so excited for the tv [ __ ]

00:43:51.08 to come on and then the tv show just kicks you in the

00:43:54.05 testicles and then it's back on you for the next time it's a really odd way to

00:43:58.10 consume content does it have to be like was there something special about

00:44:02.21 outskirts that made it unique to that challenge or could you play any other

00:44:06.21 halo level and just do it again you don't have to shoot anything

00:44:10.13 yeah well in my opinion no I think we could do other levels it's just I'm

00:44:14.09 waiting for Gavin to make that call if he wants to pick another level I'd

00:44:18.00 love to do it oh I suggested odst Andrew sounds desperate man he's playing

00:44:22.17 [ __ ] pay-to-win I'm playing chef black he's desperate

00:44:25.10 he's been ever since outskirts ended he's been

00:44:28.01 just coming up with ideas left right there all very good ideas but I still

00:44:31.10 think the thing that would anger him most is losing outskirts again

00:44:36.10 well yeah I talked the problem with it though is so

00:44:39.09 before we did any of this before face was even a thing

00:44:42.19 I got into an argument with somebody about who had a higher leader board

00:44:46.11 ranking in trials and I saw that Gavin had all the best beginner times and I

00:44:50.12 think I've talked about this already yeah

00:44:53.22 I challenged Gavin and I beat all of his times but

00:44:56.00 one and I played it every day because trials is so easy to drop in and out of

00:44:59.20 it was how I started my morning and it took me a hundred days

00:45:03.01 to beat gavin's time I just do it every day and you can't really do that without

00:45:07.20 skirts like you need momentum it's at least like an

00:45:09.23 hour-long commitment to even get a run like you can't there's a flow to it so

00:45:13.14 this is tough I know you want to be that time I just don't see you ever having

00:45:18.23 a large enough block that you could purely dedicate

00:45:21.16 to purely annoying to just annoy me yeah I don't think it happened there will be

00:45:25.16 a time in my future where I can do that I think probably I think it'd be more

00:45:30.08 interesting though if we just picked a different level

00:45:33.22 you know what you know what Andrew phantom

00:45:37.05 what if I go to england I'm gonna have to quarantine

00:45:39.17 for like 10 days or five if I get if I do the test after day five

00:45:43.10 uh huh that might be all I need are you doing are you saying for like an

00:45:46.21 outskirts you're gonna set a new outskirts time

00:45:49.12 maybe just gotta bring an Xbox five straight days of outskirts oh I think I

00:45:54.08 can get that done

00:45:56.15 you were so unhappy I talked to you on that last day the day you lost and I've

00:46:02.16 never heard you sound so depressed it was sad it was the end of something

00:46:07.12 special for us it was uh and also the it's gone like

00:46:11.12 those streams have vanished twitch has removed them

00:46:14.05 I guess expired so there's no vod of that happening why didn't you save them

00:46:18.09 I didn't uh typically they last like a month and they changed their policies

00:46:22.03 like how long they last it was like a week um does that mean donkey kong's

00:46:26.06 gone as well oh donkey Kong is long gone but nobody needed to see donkey Kong

00:46:31.09 I love this because I agree that with Gavin that it's

00:46:35.01 it turned into great tv my favorite tv of the last few years was when Andrew

00:46:40.12 was doing his uh winner winner chicken dinner

00:46:44.19 monthly challenge in uh pub g and then those streams in uh in halo

00:46:48.15 except it's even better for me because it never punches me in the face I just

00:46:52.00 get to watch it and then so I would love it if you guys

00:46:55.02 would strike this up again because I I I'll be honest with you man I'm a

00:46:58.00 I've watched 11 seasons of survivor in the last three weeks and I could use a

00:47:01.07 dif maybe some variety.

00:47:06.06 I think the best part of when I texted Gavin that I missed out skirts I put a

00:47:11.11 question mark on it like in my car I didn't mean to but my core

00:47:15.15 was just like do you actually cause it was terrible while you're in it is this

00:47:19.08 like you're just remembering the good parts the fun of it

00:47:22.04 but I would love to have another outskirts in her life that was fun one day

00:47:26.03 one day we'll see I mean it sounds like it could be close depending on uh

00:47:30.18 I've I told Gavin this the last time we talked about this you presented it as

00:47:34.10 like I would be annoyed by it and I was very much like no I'd be fine I'm I'm

00:47:38.15 happy with where it was I tried to get the time back I wanted to

00:47:42.02 do like the king of Kong thing you know where like Steve weave sets the

00:47:46.00 new record and then billy Mitchell has that like

00:47:48.09 vh name yeah I just like submits a vhs tape at the new time

00:47:52.19 I wanted to get a time faster than the 339 and just

00:47:55.11 sit at that final checkpoint and wait for you

00:47:58.11 and I just I tried it I was impatient I was like I think this might be it I got

00:48:01.20 340.

00:48:03.03 I don't think I'll ever pass 339. So if you

00:48:06.18 hit like a 338 maybe it's it's like the mile or whatever like it's good the bar

00:48:11.12 will be raced oh just getting flashbacks it's a

00:48:14.16 miserable time while you're in it ah it's fun it'll be fun think about how

00:48:19.03 much fun everybody but you has why don't you try it I would love to see

00:48:23.02 Geoff try it oh no it's okay I don't have to do that

00:48:25.14 kind of stuff I'm gonna do a sweet I'm gonna do the sweet bike trick I'll

00:48:30.04 do that I I I provide entertainment in in scabs

00:48:33.18 for face uh you guys do the video game scaps and shades yeah scabs and chains

00:48:39.18 baby and [ __ ]

00:48:42.07 and just literal [ __ ]

00:48:45.22 that tell you guys about my [ __ ]

00:48:48.10 triangle this week no [ __ ] hell so the other day I wake up uh and I see arrow

00:48:57.12 in the hallway and Emily usually I get up you know she she barks

00:49:03.03 and lets me know sometime between typically about 5am and 7am

00:49:07.09 hey [ __ ] if you uh I need to go to the bathroom and if I encounter

00:49:11.20 one second of resistance I'm going to do

00:49:13.23 it all over everything you know so I run out and I

00:49:16.11 try to get her outside and I'm successful 99 percent of the time

00:49:20.04 but uh this is maybe Monday or Tuesday Emily got up to go to work

00:49:25.03 and I slept in a little bit and so she let arrow out

00:49:27.08 and then I just felt weird and so I got up and I looked and arrow I just saw her

00:49:30.17 in the hallway but something felt odd I couldn't figure

00:49:33.01 it out and then I realized she was taking a [ __ ] in the hallway

00:49:34.08 so I ran in there and I was like oh no the sliding glass door had been left

00:49:38.10 shut so I went to open it and like kind of

00:49:41.22 run around her while she's dumping on the carpet

00:49:43.22 in the hallway and I [ __ ] first off I kicked I kicked the [ __ ]

00:49:48.02 Barefoot so I got some [ __ ] on my big toe uh

00:49:51.00 it's like 715 in the morning and I got a shitty big toe

00:49:54.10 and I hit the so I just keep I just don't break stride I just keep running

00:49:58.05 into the kitchen to get to the paper towels or something how did you

00:50:00.13 kick it though because surely you were looking I was like I was trying to I was

00:50:04.06 trying to run around her and I just like she didn't [ __ ] in a straight line

00:50:09.09 anymore she's old and so that was like that was like it was it was like a

00:50:14.02 landmine of turds to circumnavigate and so I clipped one

00:50:18.08 uh anyway and so I get into the kitchen and as I'm realizing there's a little

00:50:22.12 bit of duty on my toe I hit I didn't see this because the

00:50:26.17 lights are I hit the p and I slide across the kitchen on p

00:50:31.09 uh I don't fall I don't fall but I definitely do like uh tom cruise risky

00:50:35.14 business uh but barefoot across the p and then so I'm like

00:50:39.17 now both feet are just soaked and pissed and I still got the duty

00:50:42.16 and I'm like and I spring into action I clean it all up it's no big deal Emily

00:50:46.02 actually cleans most of it up because she was horrified you keep going

00:50:49.22 you slide up the wall up the cold that was it that was it right that was

00:50:53.09 it then uh then later that day I was outside

00:50:57.01 cleaning up dog [ __ ] and I was barefoot

00:51:00.04 and I cleaned up all the dog [ __ ] and I turned around and I stepped right in a

00:51:04.05 big pile of dog [ __ ] that I missed and I like like I looked down as I

00:51:08.00 stepped in it like like it's like like squeezed up through

00:51:12.13 my toes like I could see I just I just didn't think you know and

00:51:17.03 and so there was like a pee incident and then two poopy incidents right oh oh

00:51:21.11 so that I count the p and the poop one together so then I was getting in

00:51:24.23 emily's car the other day because we had to take

00:51:28.04 Henry uh and we needed to go to the doctor

00:51:30.09 uh was it because of his sneeze no he had a funny sneeze around you though

00:51:34.12 no he has a it was a yeah it's uh some other stuff

00:51:37.15 but uh and I guess he uh he'd been stressed out because

00:51:40.19 he had to visit a cardiologist and he had to wear like a special doggy vest

00:51:44.17 and he had uh maybe leaked a little poop in the seat and I didn't know it and I

00:51:48.07 just sat right down in it and then emily's like uh hold on I

00:51:51.09 didn't shoot man in the house and run back out I didn't even know and then she

00:51:54.19 like gets me up and I realize that I've sat in

00:51:56.17 in a little bit of a butt squirt uh so that

00:52:00.15 that was all in the span of two days and then it hit me

00:52:04.10 it hit me that with the exception of those three incidents

00:52:07.11 things have been going pretty well for me since I I got back from Florida

00:52:10.15 uh-huh and I think I I think I realized that if I don't step on [ __ ]

00:52:15.11 [ __ ] steps on me and that's that's when I realized that that's my

00:52:20.12 place in the universe I gotta stop trying to avoid the literal

00:52:24.15 [ __ ] in my life that my the universe will let me

00:52:28.17 exist in a like a reasonably like a c plus b minus life man

00:52:34.12 as long as I stop trying to trying to jump my station

00:52:39.03 uh trying to try to live above the literal

00:52:42.04 feces and urine of of the universe uh that's not gonna work for me right any

00:52:47.18 time I try to get a big head and I try to think like oh no I'm better

00:52:52.06 than dog [ __ ]

00:52:53.22 uh I'm gonna so I'm gonna I'm gonna live a life that doesn't require me to

00:52:57.12 to live in admired and dog [ __ ] and human [ __ ] and other kinds of [ __ ]

00:53:01.21 Uh the universe says uh it hits me it knocks me whack-a-moles me right back

00:53:06.00 into the turds right so I'm just I'm just gonna embrace it

00:53:08.22 and just be just I'm not gonna be better

00:53:09.18 I'm not gonna try to be better than [ __ ]

00:53:11.18 anymore I'm just gonna step on the [ __ ] you can

00:53:14.12 at least make it easier and not be barefoot all the time I mean that is

00:53:19.01 true you can reduce how often I don't think it's I don't

00:53:22.09 think it's out of the ordinary to expect to be barefoot in my kitchen and

00:53:26.03 my hallway at seven in the morning I thought you were excited I wear shoes

00:53:29.12 enough I thought you were busy I just I had just always talked about

00:53:33.13 walking up I hadn't taken a shower yet I hadn't gotten dressed yet I was in

00:53:37.09 underwear walking you know I feel like I mean a shoe a sock is no

00:53:41.12 better than a barefoot yeah attack in some ways would be worse

00:53:44.23 I think it sucks then I'd have to wash a sock

00:53:47.06 yeah I didn't throw the sock away right and then I'd lose a [ __ ] stuff that

00:53:50.23 was more of my annoyance that you called me weird for never being a sock person

00:53:54.19 is what that combo is about I issued the first and to my recollection

00:53:59.14 only official face retraction over this term that is true I

00:54:03.14 I apologized and it admitted the heaps of hypocrisy that I that I

00:54:08.03 that I reaped on you it's uh I can only apologize so much Andrew

00:54:11.07 that's fair would you like to confess now you didn't drink the soda before and

00:54:15.07 that this was the first real attempt I 100 drank the soda it just and and

00:54:19.09 nick went back and listened to it again and he even verified that he could hear

00:54:22.10 it and just to prove this time I post because I couldn't post it on discord

00:54:26.00 for some reason so I [ __ ] uh I I posted the video of

00:54:29.15 me drinking it in the slack you guys could watch me drink this

00:54:33.05 thing yeah oh I mean the second one was verified there

00:54:36.21 yep yeah I was there drinking it yeah you slam it yeah

00:54:39.10 drink the [ __ ] out of it it's a hug if I

00:54:40.21 had more sodas I would do the two and do the 30 seconds oh it doesn't look Eric

00:54:44.15 just said it looks like a small coke was that a regulation can yeah it's 300

00:54:49.23 hold on three times 75 milliliters 12

00:54:52.08 fluid ounces yeah yeah that looks regulation it's a

00:54:55.06 good chunk you're very faster I mean as far as timing goes

00:54:59.01 get a nice view of the shelves in the background too very important

00:55:02.06 Gavin came over and he saw the shelves for the first time and then he uh he

00:55:06.00 seemed to dislike my podcast set up he just kept saying

00:55:09.14 I don't this doesn't seem like where you would record this doesn't feel right I

00:55:14.02 don't I'm bothered by it when I picture you

00:55:16.13 doing this like when I'm picturing you right now you're not in there for some

00:55:20.00 reason where am I where do you picture yeah I don't know

00:55:23.21 I mean now that I've been now that I've set foot in there I can picture you

00:55:27.01 better more what [Laughter]

00:55:31.20 but like right now I can't really picture Andrew I've never seen andre's

00:55:35.16 entire room I don't think so I don't I don't really see him in my mind in

00:55:39.20 like a I'd love to see like a blueprint of like what you think

00:55:44.00 it looks like the setup that's a great question when you when I

00:55:47.18 see andrew's bedroom the first thing that pops into me I see a wall

00:55:50.23 on the left is a door to the right is a bed

00:55:53.18 with a nightstand with a bunch of things that don't belong on it then on the

00:55:57.12 floor on the left is a sushi container yeah in the bed

00:56:01.09 is uh a keyboard that's as big as the bed

00:56:05.09 and then behind me I can't see it but I assume is a desk and a fire extinguisher

00:56:09.23 and that's andrew's room to me yeah I'm seeing the bed in the corner it's got

00:56:13.20 the eight pillows it's got the keyboard

00:56:16.13 there is a bunch of just [ __ ] and sushi and

00:56:20.02 ming and I probably like a mashed in muffin or something

00:56:25.05 no on the floor and then a fridge a sauce drawer a desk that isn't

00:56:30.12 suitable as a desk probably more of like a draw thing

00:56:34.01 it's made up like I could do you a diagram I'd love to see a diagram

00:56:38.17 we should both draw or draw andrew's bedroom

00:56:42.07 yeah I'd love to see yeah okay I want to do that

00:56:45.11 okay that's a great idea notes at the top standard ears

00:56:49.16 like Andrew do you do you picture Geoff in his shelf room

00:56:53.17 like whenever we're doing these audio only I I picture

00:56:57.18 Geoff as just purely in a room of shelves I only see shelves there's nothing else

00:57:02.17 in the room there's no door from an idea yeah it's sort of like the

00:57:06.08 end of interstellar with the we're leaning and interstellar but like

00:57:09.07 the bookshelf thing like going down that's just all I see it's just

00:57:12.17 shelving everywhere is how I imagine Geoff's setup

00:57:16.04 and he's just looking between the books at just different places yeah

00:57:20.17 exactly yeah that's what I see it's all just left socks and turds

00:57:24.19 here here this is what I'm this is what you would see that's a lot less

00:57:28.21 interesting than what I imagined it's just

00:57:30.17 it looks like yeah I'm sorry I I I just picked up all my left socks off the

00:57:36.06 floor unfortunately did you tuck the chain back in I don't

00:57:40.10 see the chain did the chains back in I see

00:57:42.20 okay yeah it's alright don't worry about it shane's always there I'm a chain guy

00:57:47.04 all right so Andrew if we both draw your room

00:57:50.04 could you then turn around in your share and take a picture of it for the next

00:57:53.22 week or something so we can cross-reference

00:57:56.05 uh yeah I could do that okay I could do that so

00:57:59.08 our homework is that we'll both draw a schematic of your bedroom

00:58:03.07 now can can you give us any instruction like obviously like the nose at the top

00:58:07.11 standard ears which were actually very good instructions I

00:58:10.14 thought okay can you give us any tips on the room yeah okay you want me to

00:58:14.15 explain the layout kind of like the key landmark well

00:58:16.23 don't give don't give too much away but just like something that needs to be in

00:58:20.06 there that you think like for instance how many doors

00:58:24.18 are in the room three doors how many you said three

00:58:28.14 I've so bedroom bathroom and closet uh I don't

00:58:31.19 uh four doors I guess technically if you wanna well there could be a door there

00:58:36.23 it could hypothetically be a door there isn't a door but there could be a door

00:58:42.19 to that space there's three there's there matching something about monsters inc

00:58:47.22 door door at the front door at the front left store at the front right

00:58:54.12 wait wait wait so okay so say say we're looking at we're drawing this

00:58:59.05 from the perspective of if you had a web cam okay yeah are there

00:59:04.04 four doors in the view I don't think you'd see any of the doors

00:59:08.15 in the view if I had a web cam.

00:59:13.22 I had a website yeah I don't think you'd see any of the you might well maybe

00:59:19.10 there's like no doors how many windows are in the room uh does it uh

00:59:24.19 oh my god well technically two technically two and how many can we see

00:59:30.10 from there like if we're trying to match Geoff's

00:59:34.05 picture I'm trying to figure out what the range would be of the web cam of what

00:59:37.18 would be uh you would maybe you would maybe you'd maybe see like half a window

00:59:43.14 window at the back okay door to the front well not too far to

00:59:48.23 the back door to the front standard doors well I just I don't know

00:59:54.08 I'm giving instructions you wanted me to not be specific door to the front

01:00:00.00 door at the top stand your doors to the side everything you're doing is making

01:00:05.05 it worse so the door is behind where the camera would be

01:00:09.16 uh one of the door yeah one of the doors yeah I thought the camera was against

01:00:15.05 the desk which was against the wall where the window is uh uh no the wall

01:00:21.07 the wall so the camera is this room how many walls do you have

01:00:25.16 uh well one two it's a four it's a standard it's a regulation four-walled room

01:00:31.14 okay a standard box regulation somehow four doors on one wall

01:00:36.04 uh there's there's no there's a door on every wall but one

01:00:41.14 okay we got multiple doors so we're looking at the wall without doors

01:00:46.12 uh yeah you would see the door without walls the what the door the wall

01:00:54.04 the whole okay yeah you know what I mean yeah just wall at the back

01:01:00.10 wall back this is like the end of it is your

01:01:04.02 is your what's at the end of your bed on the other side like your bed it goes up

01:01:08.07 against the wall and then if you were like to scoot off

01:01:11.02 of the front of it I've just fully moved into the mcdonald's and I don't want to

01:01:16.06 admit it I'm just creating a space where's the

01:01:19.15 bomb it sits to the back obviously back left

01:01:21.14 what if oh we're never going find his damn apartment with his own instructions

01:01:25.11 he's gonna find where he's in his own room Jesus Christ

01:01:29.05 well you want me to be vague I could give very detailed instructions but you

01:01:33.20 wanna you gotta kind of figure out where things are okay all right doors

01:01:43.09 where do they lead what do you mean by that what do you mean they're at the top

01:01:48.07 yeah they're at the top well the top of the you know if you're doing a space

01:01:53.11 door's at the top dude doors that makes the top

01:01:56.13 no sense but they're not on the floor what do you mean

01:01:59.00 ceiling doors no I'm doing it under the system of uh nose at the top

01:02:03.22 doors at the top and then standard windows standard window well it's a pretty

01:02:09.02 no I think one of them is not a standard window is a window in a door

01:02:13.22 a window or is it just a door that has a wing yeah I have a dream

01:02:18.23 so one of your doors has a window in it yeah my one of the doors has a window

01:02:24.04 inside is it an extra door does it go outside the house yes it does oh

01:02:29.04 okay so you have a door thank you this this actually helps so you have a door

01:02:32.08 to your bathroom a door to the interior of your house and then an exterior door

01:02:37.22 that is correct I had no idea you had an exterior door

01:02:41.15 from an exterior I have an exterior door

01:02:44.15 well it doesn't you know it's it's uh it doesn't lead to

01:02:46.23 I can't just I have a very limited space I can go to

01:02:50.02 and where are we on the like the appliances in there do we have the

01:02:53.01 keurig in there still we have the keurig in there the waffle

01:02:56.12 maker's in my kitchen now I made a waffle recently actually it's

01:03:00.17 very good so yeah where's the piss lady in reference to

01:03:03.18 this she said which window okay to the left

01:03:05.12 yeah did you see her through the window in the door or through the non-standard

01:03:09.07 wall great question it was the door window door window okay

01:03:14.02 yeah wow never I'd never used the the window window

01:03:18.09 this is this is changed this has changed the geography of your bedroom for me

01:03:23.01 I almost I will say I I had a brief moment I bought an ice cream maker at

01:03:27.18 like 12

01:03:29.07 20 a.m I never I I just like I want to be I want to make ice cream

01:03:33.20 I bought one and then I went through the pro and I thought I could put it on the

01:03:37.06 other end table so I could have a keurig to the right

01:03:40.01 and an ice cream maker to the left I have a fridge I could store what I needed

01:03:44.01 and then I realized I don't know how ice cream is made goes in the freezer

01:03:48.06 yeah well I could fig I could move it downstairs but if I could just want like

01:03:52.04 a little cone like a cone for me just a little make a

01:03:54.22 little small batch I don't know how ice cream works

01:03:57.11 I realized it's a lot of effort I thought you just poured milk and like some

01:04:01.01 chocolate and stuff and you got like sure it up haven't you well

01:04:04.01 yeah it's like a whole it's a whole process so it's are you doing like an

01:04:08.00 old-timey one no I googled what is the best ice cream maker

01:04:12.03 and then I found it on amazon and it was pretty cheap so I bought it

01:04:16.01 and then uh I I returned it or I cancelled my order like an hour later

01:04:19.22 because I realized that's not a life I want to live I'm not fully committed to

01:04:24.04 the amount of effort it would take to properly use that thing that's fair

01:04:28.15 plus you but consideration you've barely explored pickling and that was a

01:04:32.13 passing interest already oh I think you know I could be open to pickling I had a

01:04:37.01 surprise pickle and I enjoyed no it was pickled onion right

01:04:40.12 I had on the wendy's Korean burger yeah yeah that was good

01:04:44.08 I could be into pickled pinks I have some cucumbers if you need them

01:04:48.09 yeah I'd love some I didn't know cucumbers were pickles I

01:04:52.04 talked about that before but that was like a recent

01:04:56.06 realization that blew my mind but there were different things

01:04:59.04 okay well should we stop doing this I think we can I think we covered did

01:05:03.01 you have anything else you need to talk about you're a chain guy you're doing

01:05:06.10 tricks gavin's gonna film you on the weekend what's for next week Geoff

01:05:09.11 oh I guess I still had the tooth thing I got a

01:05:12.12 my I do have a charger cheek that turned out to be a real thing

01:05:15.23 but we could save that for next week or we don't ever have to talk about my

01:05:18.21 mouth again because I [ __ I hate talking about my mouth on my teeth

01:05:22.10 anymore let's just say I'm not not out of the woods let's just say there's a

01:05:25.14 let's just say there's been a hole in my tooth for two [ __ ] weeks and it's

01:05:28.15 gonna continue to be there for a little bit

01:05:31.11 can we extend just to like anyone who who is listening to this

01:05:34.12 I'd love to see your blueprints of what I described and maybe oh that's a great

01:05:37.21 the closest one if people could send in what they think based on the

01:05:41.00 instructions how it looks and what will that I might have to draw

01:05:44.03 it from the top down I'm done I'm doing two oh obviously it's top down yeah what

01:05:47.20 way did you imagine it being drawn I always assumed it was top down I

01:05:51.06 imagine like a blueprint yeah well I was I was just going to draw it from like

01:05:54.08 what Geoff's picture looks like I was just going to draw you

01:05:57.07 oh that would be weird I think it's just there's no doors over there yeah it

01:06:02.00 would be a very boring view if you did that I think you should do a top-down

01:06:05.19 doors at the top standard doors all well

01:06:08.17 two of them are standard one of them has a window in it

01:06:11.09 that's the exterior one okay so okay so the final

01:06:13.22 piece of information I need if we're drawing top down okay where is your desk

01:06:19.07 if I'm looking top down desk at the top where's your bed bed at

01:06:23.12 the back bad at the bottom so wait you're facing

01:06:25.20 you're facing up yeah I'm facing up oh god that's confusing me already all

01:06:30.00 right the beds wait the desks at the top and the beds at the bottom

01:06:34.14 yeah and the doors are at the top doors are at the top

01:06:38.13 and the external doors at the top external doors at the top

01:06:41.05 and the interior to your house doors at the top and the wrapping doors at the

01:06:44.17 top all the doors are top top of the area

01:06:48.04 yes if you drew a line in the middle of the room across

01:06:52.13 they would all be in the top area who would do that so you looking at a door

01:06:57.18 uh if I look to my left like I could see a door my peripheral

01:07:02.17 I see a door I'm not looking at it but it's in my peripheral vision yes

01:07:06.08 I'm imagining a four-walled room with like four doors in one of the corners

01:07:10.13 somehow I don't know how it makes sense I it makes no goddamn sense Gavin

01:07:13.23 I'm so confused they're at the top all right three doors I'm gonna draw that

01:07:17.16 one closet one that's important one closet closet

01:07:20.09 doesn't have a door could have a door you could put a door there but now as

01:07:24.00 the closet if we're looking at the top at the [ __ ] at the wall of doors you

01:07:28.02 have an entire wall that's just doors and then also is is

01:07:32.08 the closet to the left or the right there's only one door per wall they're just

01:07:38.19 all at the top um okay wait oh this one okay you went into your closet

01:07:44.06 to avoid the smoke getting in the fire the smoke alarm but it doesn't

01:07:48.06 it doesn't have a door no it's a walk-in

01:07:49.23 closet it's a little walk-in closet with no door

01:07:51.12 I don't know I didn't design it I didn't build this place you can put a door on

01:07:54.19 it how do you mean all four doors are at the top but they're not already in the

01:08:00.02 same wall there's no there's if you want to call

01:08:03.05 the closeted door that doesn't have a door then there's technically one wall

01:08:07.18 with two doors but outside of that there is one door per wall and they're

01:08:13.09 all at the top but they're not all on the same wall Gavin I I hate

01:08:18.06 this I'm gonna have to listen to this back at like point five speed

01:08:23.12 it's very similar oh Gavin it's very simple all of the doors are at the top

01:08:27.04 but they're on different walls yes and I have four walls

01:08:30.12 they're non-standard windows and one of them is in a door yeah

01:08:34.06 well I've got one very standard window one door not standard window I'd say I'd

01:08:38.00 say it's not the standard one I should draw the room that I thought

01:08:42.15 he lived in before this explanation and then

01:08:45.16 the room that he's convinced me he lives in now they're very different

01:08:49.23 I can't wait to see these drugs I feel like once again like the nose thing you

01:08:53.12 guys said crazy instructions or at least Gavin did uh I feel it's very clear

01:08:58.09 I mean based on the information I have I'm gonna draw a room that defies

01:09:01.09 physics yeah you're gonna have [ __ ] a ceiling full of doors

01:09:05.23 sauce tower also at the top I feel like that's important

01:09:08.22 what's at the top the sauce tower the sauce pyramid that I've built the sauce

01:09:13.02 construction your entire [ __ ]

01:09:16.00 apartment is at the top what's on the what's at the bottom my bed

01:09:20.05 he lifts my bed in my carrick it's like a two-dimensional room

01:09:24.23 it's the opposite of interstellar I got my bed my keurig

01:09:29.02 I got my end tables my nightstands it's not so stellar is what this is

01:09:34.11 do you sleep on a shelf on the wall at the top

01:09:37.20 I sleep on a very comfortable bed uh with a surrounded by a thousand pillows

01:09:43.15 and a keyboard bed at the bottom Eric Eric gets it

01:09:47.16 if oh yeah it could be a Murphy bed does not fall out

01:09:50.21 it takes up a lot of room though it's a king-sized bed it's a big bed so it's

01:09:54.05 going to eat up a lot of the space no it's just it's just a diagram I'm

01:09:57.20 saying it's going to fill up a lot of space it's not a big room

01:10:00.12 bed takes up a lot of the room is what you're saying I'm saying it's a majority

01:10:04.06 of my roommate's bed yeah if you're gonna measure it

01:10:08.06 right mostly bed that's fair okay okay I'm gonna get to work on this

01:10:13.05 yeah yeah I'm gonna probably forget and then do it 10 minutes before next week

01:10:18.08 can't wait so I'll get right on that next Thursday
