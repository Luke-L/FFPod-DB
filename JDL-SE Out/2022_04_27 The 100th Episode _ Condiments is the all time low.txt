00:01:59.12 getting that tattooed on you right now I already had I had I had uh one of the

00:02:04.08 most talented tattoo artists in Austin Derek biggest one tattooed me a few

00:02:09.22 times I had him we created three custom face tattoos I think we're gonna make it

00:02:15.13 I think we're gonna make a uh I think [ __ ] this is hard to talk I think we're

00:02:20.02 gonna make a uh we're gonna make some temporary tattoos but I went ahead and

00:02:24.22 Derek and I we placed all three of these

00:02:28.03 on my body and then we figured uh I will let you guys pick which one I get to

00:02:31.18 right at the beginning [Laughter]

00:02:34.18 probably get all three wait you're doing this

00:02:39.19 with this talk you did this thing for an audio podcast yeah it's hard for you to

00:02:45.17 talk like minute one as well well you know I was facing myself and the podcast

00:02:49.22 and the audience and you well I didn't want to keep Derek hanging around right

00:02:55.11 well I know you know uh Derek's a busy man he's got he's got [ __ ] to do uh

00:03:00.23 outside of tattooing me on my ribs six yeah I'm getting the Don Zimmer Pedro

00:03:06.09 Martinez fight outlined on my wrist right now which is one of the one of the

00:03:10.07 more painful places to get tattooed I might say you're sat on your nice desk

00:03:14.13 you know nice shelves all around just with with gut hanging out and a tattoo

00:03:18.23 going on the ribs is that what it is definitely gut hanging out for sure here

00:03:24.13 let me share let me see if you can see I'll share my video oh I'd love to see

00:03:29.03 okay there you go

00:03:31.22 so there you go that's what's going on right now

00:03:38.23 what did what did you guys do for episode 100

00:03:45.00 .

00:03:50.20 You look like Burt Reynolds in Playgirl magazine thank you I feel like Burt

00:03:56.10 Reynolds in Playgirl magazine I wish I had his hair piece oh yeah.

00:04:11.04 I am recording on my iPhone from behind so it's gonna I realized after I set it

00:04:16.09 up it's not gonna look good but uh yeah yeah so anyway this is what I'm doing

00:04:21.14 for 100 Andrew Gavin what do you guys got it's so much bigger than ice

00:04:26.12 we saw it I had made it I had to make it way too

00:04:31.09 big actually when I saw it I I shut my face

00:04:34.15 oh my God so I've never gotten a tattoo it's hard to speak I also imagine it's

00:04:40.08 laughing is the thing you would want to avoid I would assume you just you just

00:04:45.23 want to stay still as still as possible um it's only it's only it's only hard to

00:04:52.05 speak in certain spots tattoos tend to hurt the worst in my experience over

00:04:57.14 when it's right over bone like ribs ribs are a particularly tough spot to get it

00:05:03.13 um there's some fleshy Parts can hurt a lot too uh chest hurts quite a bit for a

00:05:09.10 boy uh elbows are bad um uh yeah I hear behind the knee is a

00:05:12.23 particularly rough spot I've never done that not looking forward to it uh anyway

00:05:18.14 uh what's new with you guys I just is there anything any imagery

00:05:22.18 that Geoff is making you think of Gavin right now just when you look at him

00:05:26.21 there any Vibes that you're getting from this I feel like something you would

00:05:30.18 like see on the the roof of like the ceiling of a cathedral I don't know why

00:05:34.16 I'm getting real mermaid vibes from here that's why I lost it it just feels very

00:05:39.17 Geoff mermaid something with the way the hands are yeah I wasn't expecting the uh

00:05:43.12 the hands up on the head so keeping the arms out of the way of the ribs sort of

00:05:48.13 yeah no it makes sense but I just didn't consider it I was caught off guard.

00:05:52.02 Chef's face clenched up

00:05:54.16 yeah well neither of you have ever had a

00:05:57.17 tattoo so you don't um no no I know what I would get

00:06:02.05 where so where would you put the um where was the pencil gonna go the pencil

00:06:09.07 is on my like my right calf uh and then the Ian is on the inside of my foot

00:06:14.15 so uh I'll probably just go ahead and get those two while we're here so that

00:06:19.18 the number two the one that was picked is definitely in the worst place yeah

00:06:24.16 see I was hoping that you guys would pick a different one and then I wouldn't

00:06:27.17 have to get this one because this is the only bad one the other two are [ __ ] I

00:06:31.12 could doing a much sleep it's nothing um but you're getting a tattoo you

00:06:36.22 didn't want no I'm not saying I didn't get I didn't

00:06:40.15 want it obviously I want it I just didn't necessarily want it right in this

00:06:46.19 context yeah I mean I want to be completely covered in tattoos but I'm

00:06:51.19 not because of uh I don't know it hurts and it's not fun so you you know

00:06:56.21 I do it sparingly I'm so glad that we won't too I mean the other visuals I

00:07:01.07 can't imagine would be as good as being as caught off guard as we were with that

00:07:07.06 reveal I guess I realized for for the audience uh what one two and three are

00:07:12.06 number one is a pencil it's a number 16

00:07:15.06 pencil uh with the bite taken out of it number two was uh Pedro and Don fighting

00:07:21.14 right as uh Pedro's smushing Don's head and then uh oh [ __ ]

00:07:26.14 oh you can hear the faint Buzz of the game that was a good spot uh and then

00:07:31.19 tattoo number three is the Ian face uh looking up standardized nose oh man

00:07:36.16 it's incredible I uh I feel I'm glad I didn't even

00:07:41.00 attempt so I had two things in mind for this episode one of them would

00:07:44.18 antagonize Geoff so I didn't want to do that and the other one would antagonize

00:07:49.16 the audience which also felt rude to do on such a special episode 100. I just

00:07:54.09 didn't want to annoy anybody so I don't have anything planned but I know Gavin

00:07:59.20 you've had this amazing story that we've

00:07:59.20 used two weeks well you've been annoying

00:08:02.23 the audience Andrew since you didn't eat the pencil so what's what's different

00:08:06.20 now well it's just you could trust me I could take it other levels we could go

00:08:10.12 to some other places with it I didn't want to this is a celebratory episode.

00:08:15.22 Geoff's getting a tattoo it's good vibes Good Vibes I uh I want a new guess at

00:08:20.12 the uh previously on voice oh yeah oh of course let's do the the previous song

00:08:24.20 guesses Geoff have you thought of a new guess is it go ahead

00:08:29.05 you're allowed to ask a question as well

00:08:32.05 don't forget you know you had a question and a guess oh okay uh is it uh

00:08:37.09 is it a public figure uh no okay is it someone oh did I ask this last

00:08:43.21 time is it someone we've heard on the show before did I ask that uh someone

00:08:49.11 you've heard on the show could you be a little bit more specific has their voice

00:08:55.05 been in an episode of face no oh God I have not oh

00:08:58.13 and it's been very fun to see the guesses there have been a lot of posts

00:09:03.00 and different threads about who the voice could be it's been very

00:09:06.03 entertaining to follow is it uh my guess will be it's somebody

00:09:10.03 from my hubby's Bagels that's that's that's your guess your

00:09:15.00 official guess no that is incorrect okay is it a descendant of the inventor of

00:09:20.08 the butt plug you don't get another question

00:09:23.16 unless that's who you're guessing that's my guess

00:09:27.11 I don't know the ancestry of the butt plug inventor so I don't feel

00:09:31.09 comfortable giving you an answer to that I would assume no I would be shocked if

00:09:35.07 that was the case but there have been weirded coincidences with this show so I

00:09:39.23 don't feel like I could fully rule it out but I highly unlikely you guys have

00:09:44.05 to go again next episode we do we're still we're still looking it's been

00:09:47.18 crazy some of the guesses I am seeing guesses from people that are way more

00:09:51.11 creative than I could have ever come up with so let me ask you this as not as an

00:09:55.15 official question but just as a conversation has anyone in the com how

00:10:00.19 does a comment lever got it right nobody has gotten it exactly right that's

00:10:04.11 interesting that's interesting there have been there's been some people

00:10:08.15 that I'm like wow I'm surprised you're that close but yeah there's not been a

00:10:13.02 definitive correct guess as of yet this could tell this right

00:10:17.12 we're gonna be all the way up to 200

00:10:19.22 before we get there I feel like you guys asked some great questions and really

00:10:23.01 narrowed it down it's an unsolvable riddle

00:10:25.06 I'm gonna need a running document though of everything we know before I met it.

00:10:31.08 I don't remember everybody you've guessed never mind the questions but yeah um

00:10:36.12 my favorite one I think is Nick some people thought it was Nick can you

00:10:41.05 imagine How how Wild of a and just bad it'd be such a lame reveal if it's just

00:10:47.05 Nick what what you what's lame about Nick well it's just he's in every like

00:10:52.02 there'd just be such a strange strange thing and nothing against Nick

00:10:56.14 Nick is great I love Nick Nick's fantastic but just teasing it'd be like

00:11:01.22 if I had you do the voice Gavin what a lame reveal that would be is it Gavin

00:11:06.22 is it me is it you

00:11:10.12 that would be amazing if it was oh sweet my ribs are done that was [ __ ] fast

00:11:16.17 already wow yes he's moving straight on yeah we might as well just do the rest

00:11:21.04 of them right that was I mean it's not it's not impeding the the progress of

00:11:25.15 the tattoo or of the podcast at all is it I would say no I don't think so

00:11:29.20 all right I don't even know if that question was for me but I'm gonna say

00:11:33.03 now this is great I I have an update from we were talking about uh stuff not

00:11:38.14 arriving for months that was that West Elm oh I've been meaning to ask that

00:11:42.07 yeah did Geoff get the basket did you ever get your basket Geoff uh I did I

00:11:46.04 would the picnic basket yeah we did get it okay oh how was it uh I haven't used

00:11:51.06 it yet but it's lovely great it's uh it's as advertised and I got the dead by

00:11:57.07 daylight statue delivered what last week after having placed the order in what

00:12:01.18 was it January 2020. Just arrived and how is the dead by daylight statue uh

00:12:06.20 it's good it lights up it's nice Eric ass is such a crazy story no that's

00:12:11.20 not the story.

00:12:14.21 Geoff's just walking with the mic in his hands

00:12:19.17 I'm not in my box or something I'm in the uh he's wearing smallish shorts just

00:12:26.15 walking around his house carrying a microphone this is so insane these are

00:12:32.02 the swim trunks I wear every day of my life in the summer yeah so 80s

00:12:38.10 what does that mean what's wrong with the 80s I grew up in

00:12:42.20 the 80s 80s were [ __ ] awesome yeah you're like an 80s footballer thank you

00:12:47.17 I appreciate that I'll take that as the compliment I assume it is.

00:12:52.10 I was so I was trying to think of the thing that we had to be here at this

00:12:57.23 specific time to record this episode because Geoff had booked something I had

00:13:02.07 no idea what it was I did not expect this no well I'm glad this is incredible

00:13:07.15 I'm not supposed to yeah now this actually is terrible

00:13:11.07 because it's like it's like we're in bed with you it's like.

00:13:16.06 I don't enjoy this it's a lot a lot more fun with the big spoon

00:13:23.19 why don't you tell your story Gavin uh well I got some visual aids for it so

00:13:28.21 if you can't see the screen I'll wait for you I can look over

00:13:33.14 is there any update outside of the fact you got it

00:13:37.15 yeah nope just letting you know I figured out okay that was quite a long

00:13:43.11 time that was like seven what 800 days or something it was ridiculous 100 days

00:13:49.03 it's pretty long it's not even a thank me later set up that was just the world

00:13:53.08 the world just did that to you don't even need that

00:13:56.15 you should turn around and sell it on eBay for twice the cost and say that you

00:14:00.06 uh I'm sure there are other people out there that are waiting hundreds of days

00:14:04.02 for their statues what you're going to do with your fridge yeah like I'm gonna

00:14:07.11 do in the fridge what did you call it profiteering how many vinyls do you have

00:14:10.22 for this morning still have them all three do you want one

00:14:15.16 I'm not opposed it's just I love that you have three I assumed you would do

00:14:20.10 something with it by this point I've already sent you something different

00:14:23.22 this week did okay did it come through Amazon

00:14:31.11 oh boy well I got a call yesterday huh from someone that it just their call

00:14:39.06 display was Ontario which I found very suspicious it was just a region uh and

00:14:45.06 they called and they left a voicemail it was hard to understand like it was

00:14:49.06 breaking up and stuff but they did say I'm from Amazon I'm trying to find where

00:14:53.07 you live and I thought I didn't order anything

00:14:56.19 from Amazon this is suspicious huh so I don't uh maybe check maybe check the

00:15:02.05 status of that order oh [ __ ] you should

00:15:06.06 maybe see because I don't have it but I definitely got called twice yesterday

00:15:11.23 from somebody listed as Ontario uh oh well I was sort of hoping it would

00:15:17.06 arrive in time uh that's a shipt that's what it says so it might be

00:15:22.03 unreal I did get uh to talk about something that will already be well out

00:15:26.06 I received the uh regulation listener and comment lever shirts oh how else I

00:15:30.17 haven't got I haven't gotten those yet I

00:15:32.11 haven't either yeah they're great I mean they're they're as designed they're

00:15:36.15 basic and they say what they should say on them so maybe it's that but that'd be

00:15:41.02 wild if Amazon delivered that I don't know I'll keep my eyes open though for

00:15:45.08 for the Amazon package we have a we did a thing Eric and I did a thing the other

00:15:51.07 day yeah we went out with we had little Bros night oh my God I'm so glad we're

00:15:55.11 gonna talk about this yeah how was bro's night well the film was amazing wasn't

00:16:01.01 there ambulance might be the best movie I've ever seen in theaters

00:16:08.18 Lee unhinged film I can't believe it exists

00:16:13.03 and I had such a good time in this empty ass theater like uh I loved it I loved

00:16:19.18 it I had such a good time I genuinely believe that Michael Bay turns up on set

00:16:24.14 and opens the case of lenses and takes like the 18 mil and the 35mm like but

00:16:29.05 all the wide lenses and just throws them into the sea at the beginning of each

00:16:35.01 filming day every single shot was like up Jake Gyllenhaal's nostrils or like in

00:16:40.12 his eye it's like the guy hates zooming out now

00:16:43.12 is it a typical Michael Bay movie where the movie ends and then they surprise

00:16:47.06 you with a whole other movie at the end uh I've missed I missed the end I'll be

00:16:52.12 honest uh no it is I will say it is the most

00:16:57.07 Michael Bay movie I think he's ever made in the way that it looks and feels and

00:17:02.12 moves it is uh like it's insane how crazy that movie is from Geoff there is

00:17:10.00 three minutes of exposition and then they are like off to the [ __ ] races

00:17:15.12 and the exposition at the beginning is the funniest Exposition you can do it is

00:17:20.21 my wife needs experimental surgery insurance provider and then they hang up

00:17:26.02 on him and then he goes time to go to work and it's insane

00:17:31.06 I I hate getting up to piss especially the first time I've seen a movie but

00:17:36.21 that movie was so freaking long and I accidentally well I sort of misjudged

00:17:42.22 how big a 32-ounce beer was and I ordered the counter uh so by the end of

00:17:47.21 it I was like writhing in my seat I was like ah this movie needs to end like we

00:17:53.05 must be at the end and then like 20

00:17:55.15 minutes later I was like oh God and uh so so I just got up probably we'll just

00:17:58.16 say Eric like three minutes before before the question yeah and then you

00:18:02.15 came back when the credits like started but the credits only like the credits

00:18:07.23 were like so short you didn't give a [ __ ] the credits were 15 seconds long

00:18:13.08 and then it was like get out I I got up probably 60 maybe 65 seconds away from

00:18:17.23 pissing my pants that's the that was the timer I was on and it was that stage of

00:18:21.23 piss where it's like your blood is so full if you could feel the stretch in it

00:18:25.09 and you're almost like waddling and you're trying to like unbutton the

00:18:28.13 shorts to to give it a little bit of freedom and that's when all of the staff

00:18:32.02 the movie theater decided they wanted selfies and I was like oh my God yes but

00:18:36.21 we gotta keep moving I'm gonna piss myself so we took a little waddle run of

00:18:40.21 selfies as I went through I made it back for the two second credits but it was a

00:18:46.12 good experience uh Andrew enjoyed a video I sent him of tpg here's a

00:18:50.10 phenomenal video it delivered in ways should we like get into the specifics of

00:18:55.15 the context of that video and like leading into it yeah so you guys saw it

00:18:59.15 with tpg who is I I think in my mind at least famous on the show as being that

00:19:04.18 you [ __ ] with Hobbs and shy guy big fan of them Gavin and I were talking

00:19:10.10 what do we think tpg's top 10 movies of all time would be it has to be a

00:19:14.14 phenomenal list if you [ __ ] with Hobson Shaw you got a great top 10 list and

00:19:19.05 we're going back and forth and Gavin opened with bad boys too and I agreed I

00:19:24.02 was like that feels like it would be in the top ten that's a great pick we

00:19:27.10 basically just sat there before we went out like Andrew and I guessing tpg's top

00:19:31.21 10

00:19:33.20 And then Gavin said the raid too and I was like that's a great movie I loved

00:19:38.23 the raid too but it just it feels so strange like that's such a strangely

00:19:43.22 specific movie to be in your top ten uh and then Gavin sent me a video of tpg

00:19:49.02 not discussing his top ten discussing his top two and what potentially might

00:19:54.20 be in the third spot which is amazing is a phenomenal video If you were to guess

00:20:00.03 what do you think tpg's first greatest film of all time is Geoff

00:20:04.18 um I think it's either gonna be like the rock or uh uh Conair

00:20:15.18 uh Bad Boys 2 would be up there maybe Fast Five would be in there or it's

00:20:21.17 gonna be like Citizen Kane and Sunset Boulevard or something like totally On.

00:20:27.12 Golden Pond something you totally wouldn't expect you kind of nailed it

00:20:31.11 his number one the greatest film of all time from the goat is bad boys 2. The

00:20:36.10 greatest cinematic Masterpiece of all time then his number two which I I love

00:20:42.03 I love so much he's like for all the film snobs out there G1 we going.

00:20:46.11 Godfather one

00:20:56.04 and then he he said this is maybe my favorite part of the video that that

00:21:00.23 Gavin sent me he said okay now we're going to three list really drops off at

00:21:05.18 this point it's zero to top ten what does that mean why does it drop off

00:21:11.07 sticking it drops off significantly and then he

00:21:15.05 said this is in the running for number three and it was the raid too and his he

00:21:21.20 said that him and like 20 guys saw the raid too and in the final fight sequence

00:21:27.11 everybody stood up and was watching it and they felt like it was real which is

00:21:31.18 insane that's how much he likes bad boys too he thought he watched a brawl in a

00:21:37.06 theater like it was real life people dying and it's three it's not even three

00:21:41.15 it might be three it's a distant three I

00:21:44.11 just like they I was pretty much correct

00:21:46.18 on my guesses he was saying everything I said to you and I just I laughed and

00:21:50.12 just stopped the recording because I was like I've got everything I need

00:21:54.12 and then we had to go and watch the movie oh and then you guys were seeing

00:21:58.16 it in 40x is how it was explained going into it and I was so jealous of like I

00:22:03.04 don't have that available to me I knew Eric was having a great time watching it

00:22:07.14 I can't watch with tpg sadly so I feel like I'm missing out on the experience

00:22:11.05 but just the seats alone it's like that's a whole Lair I feel like I'm

00:22:14.02 missing to then learn that you guys didn't even see it in that way you just

00:22:17.20 saw it in a normal setting yeah what was that about all right why did we go to

00:22:23.12 that one I I think okay so I will say that Tim texted me the next day and the

00:22:30.01 text just read bro that theater Hidden Gem might be top 10. So I think he just

00:22:35.15 really likes that theater but also I thought we were seeing it in 4dx turns

00:22:41.12 out that movie is not in 4dx that's insane can you believe ambulance is not

00:22:46.00 in 4dx we saw it in a regular theater and it was the most thrilling time I

00:22:50.04 might have ever had in a movie you mentioned those fpv drone shots in 4dx

00:22:54.10 it would have been no I no I wouldn't have been able to live tweet the whole

00:22:57.15 there's no one in that theater I live tweeted the whole movie because no one

00:23:02.12 was there and I loved everything oh yeah oh my Twitter that night was on fire

00:23:08.20 insane oh dude I loved it I loved it I had such a good time and you said that

00:23:13.18 the movie was the theater was empty dude there were like how many more people

00:23:18.06 were there in that theater Gavin three maybe was this opening weekend oh yeah

00:23:22.09 that was like the day it came out.

00:23:24.22 I want to see it so badly I need to see ambulance I don't want to see it at all

00:23:30.08 nothing about that trailer looked good to me it's awesome it is unhinged you ha

00:23:37.00 like you have to I want everyone I know to see this movie it is it is like

00:23:42.04 there's people who are like oh yeah I only watch cinema this takes Cinema to a

00:23:48.12 place where I didn't know it could go it was incredible I don't I don't know

00:23:53.22 anything about it I've somehow avoided like all the trailers I just know it's

00:23:57.04 an action movie with Michael Bay called ambulance I saw somebody make a joke

00:24:01.06 tweet that was like this movie is crazier than I realized I didn't know

00:24:04.13 the lead character's name was Michael J ambulance and I had look up to see if

00:24:08.03 that was true like it's the type of movie where if that was true it wouldn't

00:24:12.01 faze me at all like it feels like it could happen I need to see it I'm

00:24:15.17 excited to watch it I was jealous of your your great evening with tpg yeah I

00:24:20.11 wish you were there I wish everyone was there oh it would be an amazing

00:24:24.01 experience I wanted to be in the theater with the raid too as really I think the

00:24:28.22 thing we all missed witnessing that live fight I feel like the thing that Tim

00:24:33.00 explained to us later is that he wasn't sure if everyone else was standing or if

00:24:38.21 he was the only one standing believing the movie was real but but either way he

00:24:44.01 loved it that's great it's a great movie The Raid 2 is [ __ ] awesome

00:24:47.07 amazing fights how are you doing Geoff I'm good I'm trying to take pictures of

00:24:52.05 my tattoos for you guys oh nice wait tattoos you got the second one I got all

00:24:58.11 three he's already got all three minutes we're 25 minutes into the episode

00:25:03.23 three tattoos in 20 minutes yeah I didn't I didn't expect it to take all day

00:25:09.03 I didn't expect it to take 20 minutes I was wondering if we'd be able to get

00:25:13.23 all three in I thought two all three is wild I wonder if you didn't say anything

00:25:18.03 how many tattoos you could get within an

00:25:20.04 hour without us knowing at all that'd be an amazing reveal that you've gotten

00:25:24.10 like 15 tattoos for the beginning to the end of the

00:25:26.23 episode that the moment the camera turned on might have been the greatest

00:25:32.10 reveal in space history I've ever seen in cinema history like

00:25:37.21 there is no reveal that could top that I almost every reveal now that's all I'm

00:25:41.23 gonna think about that [ __ ] thing Geoff on his side with his hands on his head

00:25:46.12 I guess something else we should talk about just very briefly I guess is uh

00:25:50.22 there's uh somebody in the community made a game for us surprisingly was that

00:25:55.02 I saw the link to that but I couldn't do it on my phone what was that it's uh

00:25:58.11 yeah I had to use my my desktop to play it and just off browser uh it's a like a

00:26:03.17 I don't know how to describe the game but it's uh it's like a it's from

00:26:07.08 somebody who named Michael's game lab what was it called it's called face knob

00:26:13.07 drop and it's like [Music]

00:26:15.04 it's a gamer like Things fall down so you have to collect you have to eat

00:26:20.00 burgers hot dogs and Waffles while avoiding pencils baseball bats and

00:26:25.13 something else and you're just moving your mouse like across the stream with

00:26:29.11 an end you're controlling an Ian face and there's a no scrumping warning that

00:26:33.06 will appear and apples will like fall on the screen and if you hit an apple you

00:26:36.12 lose life like you can easily die from the apples it's a lot of fun I started

00:26:40.16 it got number one in the leader board would talk [ __ ] about it and just have

00:26:46.06 been demolished people are way ahead drift is supposed to his tattoos wow

00:26:52.13 these are amazing these are like so good I like that Ian's looking at the duck

00:26:58.23 it's a goose the goose and it's close enough that fart hard

00:27:03.06 feels like a thing that Ian could be saying to the goose oh right like fart

00:27:07.20 heart is coming out of Ian's mouth yeah

00:27:10.05 really good well there you go well I hired I hired like I said Derek's one of

00:27:15.18 the best uh tattoos in America let alone Austin uh say when you do it you do it

00:27:20.21 right oh the pencil that's amazing that looks fantastic what a reveal speaking

00:27:26.15 of things that like reveal happy 100 by the way I've never gotten in 19 years uh

00:27:32.04 since I started uh helped start this company I've never got a a company

00:27:36.20 related tattoo these are my first wow that's amazing I saw my nose is on there

00:27:42.19 that's is that just me ah [ __ ] I forgot about your nose yeah I guess there's

00:27:47.01 that one that is true I've only gotten one other company related tattoo

00:27:52.11 oh Andrew should we get one uh I'm I'm not opposed to getting a tattoo I've

00:27:58.11 just never never got one I got a good review it's it's across your ankle and

00:28:03.21 it just says snap here oh I don't think that would imply it requires snapping

00:28:09.23 and that it's not already happened it's we're already how are the legs this week

00:28:14.03 uh it's okay okay I think it would just maybe like waste of space would be

00:28:18.23 probably a more appropriate just useless maybe just useless across

00:28:23.08 different options we can work shopping use and less across

00:28:28.22 looks like useless [Laughter]

00:28:33.04 [Applause]

00:33:03.20 you ever um this is such a weird poll did you ever watch that Flat Earth

00:33:09.14 documentary that was like popular to you it was like a really popular Flat Earth

00:33:14.14 documentary and just like it's so ridiculous it feels like a like Best in.

00:33:19.22 Show type movie but it's a documentary and one of the guys in it is like

00:33:23.17 talking about how marketable um it is and how it's like their secret

00:33:27.14 underworld and he shows this guy a license plate and he's like what does

00:33:31.06 this say to you and the guy says NASA lies he's like yeah but it could also be

00:33:36.20 nasal ice could be ears throat no specialist you don't know we're under

00:33:40.06 the record read sneaky that's always what I think about just stupid like

00:33:45.04 misreading a thing nobody would read this read that as nasal eyes yeah it's

00:33:49.08 not that Pen Island website was that the

00:33:51.23 documentary where the guy disproved that the Earth was flat in the documentary

00:33:55.18 and then decided that his test must have been flawed yes yes it was I forgot

00:34:00.17 about that I watched that movie sometimes when I watch movies I'll take

00:34:05.05 like notes if I plan on talking about them in some way I took like 200 notes

00:34:09.20 in that 90 minute movie It's So absurd and there's so much funny stuff in it

00:34:14.02 it's a very awkward like the the guy that they're kind of following clearly

00:34:17.15 is in love with this girl that has no interest in him at all and this is very

00:34:21.18 their interactions are great I wish I could remember what it was called it's

00:34:25.08 probably still on Netflix it's it's dumb

00:34:27.17 it's a ridiculously stupid movie that is a lot of fun to watch should we get

00:34:31.10 reflective on episode 100 like what's what's our favorite moment from face so

00:34:35.23 far wow favorite moment What's the shittiest moment the shittiest moment oh wow

00:34:42.05 potato tots yeah all time low condiments is the all-time

00:34:47.05 low that's a great call that was not just like an all-time low for the show.

00:34:54.07 [Laughter]

00:34:57.07 That's that's the all-time low for our friendship Chef without a doubt like by

00:35:02.23 a lot well well so far so far I don't know where the baseball thing ranked as

00:35:09.12 far as your personal I had one the baseball movie was one bad day uh I was

00:35:14.23 way I was I was angry about the tater tots that is true and it felt like a

00:35:20.02 thing that would linger we just had to move on I was bummed about the baseball

00:35:25.18 thing uh I was angry about the tots it was estranged of all things it was

00:35:29.15 like a religious argument where not only did we view the other side as wrong we

00:35:33.06 could in no way see how they could view it as a right like there is no

00:35:38.02 compromise or middle ground we were so locked into our definitions I think my

00:35:43.13 favorite moment so far has is very recent and I think it was uh.

00:35:48.17 Andrew's reaction to looking at the bean hole pictures I just love that moment

00:35:54.13 I couldn't flew up oh it was it was a problem it's

00:35:58.11 one of the hardest I've ever left for sure I think the hardest not to like

00:36:03.13 pivot away from reminiscing about the show I don't think I've told the story

00:36:09.13 on the show Once I I laughed so hard one time I nearly fainted like genuinely

00:36:14.10 nearly fainted I was playing Pub G and I

00:36:17.15 was playing with some friends and uh you

00:36:19.15 know like have you ever seen I know Geoff will definitely be aware of this play

00:36:22.20 but are you aware like the Larry Bird steel Gavin where it's like he reads the

00:36:27.06 floor before anything happens he like Sprints to the exact right like he just

00:36:31.02 knows what's gonna happen and he reads it and he executes it perfectly like he

00:36:35.07 just he knows it's a fantastic it's one it's one of the greatest moments in the

00:36:38.17 history of basketball but it's like basketball yeah it's a basketball thing

00:36:42.12 but it's like being in the zone it's like he knew what was gonna happen he

00:36:46.18 read it he [ __ ] predicted it and he executed it I was playing Pub G and my

00:36:50.19 friend was like in the bottom of this hill and he was going and sniped at from

00:36:54.15 all angles and there's this big tree next to him and he got tagged by a

00:36:58.06 sniper and he's like I'm down and so I turn and I see this car and I have my

00:37:02.18 Larry Bird moment of I see like okay I'm gonna get in the car I'm gonna drive it

00:37:07.01 to the tray the car will then be like a barricade for us I'm gonna pick up my

00:37:11.23 friend and we're gonna go and escape this is [ __ ] I've got this I get in

00:37:15.09 the car I hit Drive I immediately run my friend over and crash into the tree at

00:37:21.09 full speed I kill him immediately and crash the car and I laughed so hard like

00:37:25.08 all the air shot out of my body and I felt like I was gonna faint like I

00:37:29.03 started to go down my head a little bit but I crashed the car and I'm still in a

00:37:33.19 war zone so like I'm trying to gather myself so I'm not fainting while

00:37:37.13 laughing and I'm just getting sniped at from all sides and I'm like I gotta get

00:37:42.05 out of here so I hop in the car and I go but I'm like barely like I'm fainting

00:37:46.23 I'm like in and out of it as I'm driving the car because it was like gonna

00:37:50.06 breathe in I couldn't breathe and I just couldn't stop I was just laughing so

00:37:54.11 hard that like the lights were going out

00:37:56.16 and I'm just driving away it was like in

00:37:58.18 a movie where a guy got shot and he gets

00:38:00.14 in the car and like barely escapes I was getting almost television yeah I was

00:38:05.04 having tunnel vision news I can imagine you just sat intensely

00:38:09.05 you'll scream like starting to slump over if you that's exactly like my my

00:38:14.08 head went down I was like holding myself up on my desk with my arms if you would

00:38:19.06 ask me going to my friend like the odds of this working and the way I wanted it

00:38:23.05 to a hundred percent I've never been more confident that anything was gonna

00:38:27.12 work in my life and I immediately ran him over and killed him and then just

00:38:32.10 crashed into the tree because I was laughing so hard as soon as I failed

00:38:36.00 it's a disastrous save the clip I wonder if I have that I might I should look

00:38:40.16 yeah you should look for that that is a great

00:38:43.06 um oh Nick picked this Nic pick the sewing machine argument the sewing

00:38:46.10 machine argument is a great one because that was at the end of an episode that

00:38:50.10 none of us were all that happy with or like that wasn't that great and then we

00:38:54.10 we ended and then it was 30 minutes of sewing machine talk that was not at all

00:38:58.23 supposed to be part of the episode I don't think we were even recording at

00:39:04.02 that point and if it wasn't for Craig I don't think we would have had that audio

00:39:08.08 uh I think talking about your that Pub G incident making you laugh one of my

00:39:14.07 favorite memories of the podcast has got to be

00:39:17.21 um before the podcast it was when I had the idea for the beef bracelet and then

00:39:23.03 as I was having that idea I realized I wanted to make a commercial and so I

00:39:28.10 rode my bike down to the park to film it and I I was laughing and I was trying

00:39:32.19 not to laugh out loud but I was laughing internally at all the people that were

00:39:36.12 watching me ride up and down this path over and over again doing multiple takes

00:39:40.13 filming with one hand while I was eating beef jerky off my wrist with the other

00:39:44.10 no hands on the bike it's just people look at me just trying to have their

00:39:47.18 lunch while before they go back to work like because I'm just going back and

00:39:51.17 forth I probably did eight times uh just looking like a lunatic I didn't know

00:39:55.00 that that's really funny I didn't realize it took you so many takes oh you

00:39:58.08 got to get it just right man it's for that's commercial yeah super important

00:40:02.03 too as the debut of uniform um show it off in the best light what

00:40:06.04 about you Eric have you ever had a good time making this

00:40:10.14 I I love the middle of every episode and then despise the end of every episode I

00:40:16.05 think that's typically how this goes where it's like look I told you guys

00:40:20.15 beforehand this is episode 100 we're only recording one so I don't want you

00:40:23.15 to feel like we have to be constrained to an hour so that's fine typically we

00:40:27.06 do have to be constrained for an hour because these are hour-long shows and we

00:40:31.11 sometimes do two or other things are going on so the middle of every episode

00:40:37.06 I really really really love but the end is just so difficult when it doesn't

00:40:42.19 need to be I think the worst is when we Geoff is like wrapping it up

00:40:47.06 because he knows it's time to go and then Andrew just sort of like side

00:40:51.23 swipes with like the most inane [ __ I and it's like just save it what are you

00:40:56.09 doing in the middle of the outro was like you

00:41:00.04 ever watched [ __ I on quibby yeah [Laughter]

00:41:09.22 Oh uh by the way I'm I'm back guys Derek's gone I'm sitting on my desk like

00:41:15.12 normal so uh the tattoo song is over I yeah you have my full attention now I

00:41:20.09 apologize for being half in half out for the first half it was great it was a

00:41:26.17 great bit yeah I'm blown away I really didn't expect that I really just wanted

00:41:31.06 to in in all seriousness uh all kidding aside uh I don't I was talking about my

00:41:36.17 therapist yesterday I don't know how this happened but this podcast has

00:41:41.05 become outside of my family the most important thing in my life and the last

00:41:46.19 hundred episodes have uh helped me immeasurably in terms of uh getting

00:41:51.19 through the pandemic and also in terms of my own mental health outside of the

00:41:56.13 pandemic and uh putting putting it on my body it seems like the easiest decision

00:42:01.12 in the world to make because it's just been uh it's and also I think it's

00:42:07.12 to be uh I guess a little uh a little more personal I think it's maybe the

00:42:12.22 best thing I've ever been a part of making and it's really nice to feel at

00:42:16.16 almost 47 like I haven't plateaued and that we're still capable I'm still

00:42:20.13 capable of of contributing in a way that's uh uh gets progressively better

00:42:25.11 as time goes on right like you don't want to feel like you don't want to

00:42:28.11 realize you're on the back nine and you're you're you're you're you're

00:42:31.17 retreating uh and I and I don't feel like that every time I'm on this podcast

00:42:35.16 which is really nice I I've been blown away recently at how my pretty much my

00:42:40.06 favorite thing of every week came out of the middle of the pandemic yeah that's

00:42:44.10 the point where I'm like wow I'm uh you know not glad it happened but just like

00:42:48.04 wow I don't think we would have made this necessarily if it wasn't for the

00:42:52.15 pandemic I know it's this yeah it's this weird kind of conflict of probably well

00:42:57.03 not probably I would definitively say like the most fun I've had working on

00:43:00.18 anything and and just getting to be part of something that I think is so special

00:43:05.07 and fun um being created due to a horrible event

00:43:09.03 that impacted the entire world I packed in all of us personally

00:43:13.16 um I can't imagine what it would have been like going through those times

00:43:19.08 without this show like just being able to have a time every week especially

00:43:23.16 when things were now we're kind of in a place right now where like we're kind of

00:43:26.20 getting back in the swing of things and the schedule isn't always consistent but

00:43:30.08 when we were in the heart of pandemic knowing that every week I was gonna get

00:43:34.23 to have one hour to play with my friends um was so special and it's been so

00:43:39.20 wonderful to have that time and also just like the audience has talked about

00:43:44.14 um I I interact with the audience quite a bit and I hear a lot of how meaningful

00:43:48.22 it has been to have the space as listeners for them

00:43:51.14 um and it's just I think been equally important for us to have this space so

00:43:55.16 as much as they think us for um creating the show and doing what we

00:44:00.01 do we owe so much to them as well for supporting our show and allowing us to

00:44:04.06 go these hundred episodes and and have this space for ourselves I I literally

00:44:08.07 had that conversation with someone recently but I was like yeah you know

00:44:11.14 really helped me through the pandemic and my response was like dude me too

00:44:16.13 like thanks so much for watching it because I I equally need it yeah we we

00:44:22.04 certainly didn't talk about it in this content uh but I did go through an

00:44:27.09 entire nervous breakdown during year one of my F**kFuckFacePodcast and like had to take

00:44:32.12 a step away from my job and uh going through some intensive therapy and uh

00:44:38.05 this at this this podcast was such an anchor in my life of positivity that I

00:44:44.18 was able to forget about all of that for

00:44:48.04 an hour and five minutes or so uh a week which is honestly also why when when

00:44:52.23 Andrew swipes in with a quitty comment or whatever and I see an opportunity to

00:44:56.13 extend the podcast another 10 minutes it's just like it's just like another 10

00:45:00.18 minutes of Shangri-La before you have to care come on before we have to go back

00:45:05.08 to the real world it's kind of true and uh so really it's it's like when Eric

00:45:10.11 wants us to stop recording it's he wants to take that away from us it's

00:45:15.03 yeah it's it's been it's been a wild journey and in fact

00:45:19.04 that like it's just how it came together too and the fact that this show has

00:45:24.04 worked as well as it has in itself is absurd we've never had a production

00:45:29.10 meeting regarding the show like just everything about the creation and the

00:45:35.02 process of making it is so absurd um but I'm just so incredibly thankful

00:45:39.12 um for you guys Nick and Eric has been so I knew obviously Geoff and Gavin

00:45:42.20 before this I didn't know Eric or Nick and it's just been so much fun meeting

00:45:46.19 them um and getting to I don't know just really it's been nice this whole

00:45:52.02 experience has been wonderful um and not to get too emotional on a podcast

00:45:56.20 named face it's really it's really meant a lot so just thank

00:46:01.16 you to everybody that has supported absolutely and these 100 episodes 100

00:46:08.07 more yeah uh at least I uh I I mean I'm sitting here trying to

00:46:12.21 figure out what to do for episode a thousand I've already done the tattoo thing

00:46:20.19 yeah this is I think the thing that that

00:46:24.01 the people don't realize is that this is the most creative creative Outlet I've

00:46:28.13 ever experienced like it is unlike and we've been doing this for 19. I've been

00:46:32.03 doing this for 19 years in other Productions it's certainly not the first

00:46:36.09 or even the 50th production I've started

00:46:39.07 and uh there's been nothing like it like it's it's it is unique in every way and

00:46:44.05 as I think Eric or Nick pointed out earlier it's the you know we we started

00:46:49.18 this because of the pandemic and in that process we we had to move the entire

00:46:53.12 company the day job company uh to an online work work from home company and

00:46:58.02 so all of our Productions ended up being

00:47:00.03 work from home Productions and since the podcast every one of them has gone back

00:47:03.17 in person except for this one this is the only production that we do that's

00:47:07.13 all remote to this day but you know at some point one day in Vegas it could

00:47:12.10 happen no yeah it's going to no yeah that's we've committed

00:47:16.08 not in May in November like we've committed we're doing it so we've

00:47:21.12 committed we've all said yes we all Andrew said yes yeah yeah well I I wait

00:47:27.00 what don't that's I don't like the way that you said yes and then well yes you

00:47:32.12 committed we've all committed yeah I did I don't like the way you said yeah

00:47:37.23 yeah even though yeah it's got like half

00:47:40.13 a question let me clarify this because I 100 committed I didn't commit to a

00:47:44.16 specific date but I said I would do it and we agreed in October I think I think

00:47:49.01 that we've okay so I think we've I think we've looked at October and it might be

00:47:52.17 early November that's fine okay okay that's fine you heard him say it you

00:47:56.02 heard everyone heard him say that's fine I'm excited I've never been to Vegas

00:48:00.19 this is gonna be a great time and I've never been to Vancouver Island I mean

00:48:05.21 there's listen we got bagels we got crabs we've got everything you need when

00:48:10.15 can we go to Vancouver Island that's a great question when do you when do you

00:48:14.10 want like you're gonna say like as soon as possible no I mean like no I mean I

00:48:18.22 can't like when can you actually like not in men [Laughter]

00:48:23.10 what's the best time of the year for for Nanaimo

00:48:26.14 you probably want to go in the summer for like before November crabs uh before

00:48:32.01 yeah either like this coming into the summer or the next year you'll give us

00:48:36.23 permission to come visit in like the next two to three months you could visit

00:48:42.12 whatever you want I don't care that's you're welcome to come here whenever you

00:48:47.19 can visit whenever you want I don't care while we're there

00:48:52.15 of course but I just met the way Gavin said that was like I'm gate keeping the

00:48:58.13 island in somewhere that I don't want you guys here I'd love for you guys to

00:49:04.00 be here by the way Gavin and I just went to Seattle for like two days we were

00:49:09.03 like 45 miles away if that's a great point you you can literally take a ferry

00:49:14.23 from Seattle to the island yeah you could take a ferry I don't want to

00:49:19.13 travel we were 99 of the way there we needed you to go one percent of the way

00:49:25.12 I'm not traveling you had no interesting

00:49:29.00 if you were in Vancouver I'd gladly go I take a boat I take a boat within here's

00:49:35.04 why things happen here's what I think's really happening okay one entry was

00:49:39.17 peeping at the pissing woman the police came in they were trying to figure out

00:49:43.11 what's good They confiscated as possible for two years and I think he's waiting

00:49:47.09 to get it back I think something like that has happened I think he's literally

00:49:52.18 unable to travel I actually was looking at my idea recently

00:49:55.22 I realized I have long hair at my ID photo so there's one photo that exists

00:50:01.08 of me with long hair it exists it's just on my ID

00:50:04.08 oh God but yeah I I control I'm excited whatever you guys eventually come here

00:50:08.20 you could travel but not till November now I will end up leaving the country is

00:50:14.04 a different matter if it was a Canadian thing maybe gladly what is a stack file

00:50:18.17 what did you just send Gavin I'm trying to say I've just realized these are like

00:50:22.23 high efficiency photos I'm not sure I could even do my

00:50:26.12 slides how wait wait so you're saying that the thing that you've teased for

00:50:31.21 weeks is tied to a thing you cannot we cannot count these jpegs oh man

00:50:36.23 oh boy do you want me to click this do you want me to uh I clicked it didn't do

00:51:49.05 the other thing all right okay okay it's 36 degrees 59 on your battery you want

00:51:53.23 me to tell my shitty story I'd love to hear this story I didn't want to I

00:51:57.09 didn't mean to hype this up I was I was debating whether to tell this I've never

00:51:59.10 told anyone the story I didn't even tell

00:52:01.17 Meg until last week and she was like how have you never told me the story and uh

00:52:05.17 I'll be honest I've just been mildly traumatized by it I wasn't sure if it

00:52:09.09 was funny it might not be funny all right this might be loud

00:52:15.00 can't be worse than lactating women you got this it's fine I set the bar real

00:52:20.10 low last week okay so we're in Melbourne right uh we're doing the age live tour

00:52:26.11 Geoff you were there okay um we we got to Melbourne I think it was the day of the

00:52:33.01 tour what year was the actual date 2019

00:52:35.02 okay uh January 2019. So it's winter for us but we were in Australia so it's hot

00:52:39.17 as balls as you can see by my watch there uh 36 degrees Celsius gonna be

00:52:44.14 about 42 I think this ended up being like 4344 degrees Celsius which is like

00:52:49.11 I don't know 112 or something I don't know Fahrenheit was hot as hell it

00:52:54.00 definitely was I remember yeah and also on my watch you could see I've got Tech

00:52:57.11 rehearsal at 230. That's all I gotta do

00:52:59.19 that day woke up early went for a stroll we were in an area of Melbourne I think

00:53:04.11 called Saint Kilda if I remember uh I went for a little walk to a little

00:53:09.04 park nearby the hotel just sort of strolling around I found a pier so I

00:53:14.02 thought ah you know walk down this pier look out into the ocean

00:53:19.03 and uh I saw that the water was amazingly still

00:53:22.11 and I was like this can't this surely can't be the ocean then and then I

00:53:28.01 looked on the maps and I realized it's not the ocean it's just like a big would

00:53:31.23 you call that like an inlet like a big Bay by Melbourne so it's like perfectly

00:53:37.06 still water and I thought this is I've never seen a body of water this big that

00:53:41.07 looked so still so then I thought I'll Take Ah My thing's too powerful hold on

00:53:45.14 we're gonna move to slack I might have to move to slack here okay go into slack

00:53:50.07 I love watching you struggle with tech stuff it's a it might be my favorite

00:53:54.20 because you're such a little such a minty little prick about it usually when

00:53:59.17 everybody else's stuff goes wrong oh it's 136 Megs oh

00:54:03.18 and thank you fell in love with just one hey okay I'm sending a video of me

00:54:08.20 filming the very still water but as I was filming it the wind picked

00:54:15.04 up I had just oh Jack's here ah is he listed what is happening tell your

00:54:21.20 story what is going on where do I see this video it's in slack open this

00:54:28.00 oh Jesus now as you can see this the second I started filming the Stillness

00:54:34.05 of the water the wind picked up and uh sort of destroyed the illusion of the.

00:54:37.18 Still water so now it's the wind blowing everywhere I'm like oh man think of the.

00:54:41.08 What's the timing of that here's my next video

00:54:45.01 is this is this the end of the story that got windy okay uh so now I'm like.

00:54:50.07 Blown Away by how sudden Eric said this is insane I'm blown away at how suddenly

00:54:55.12 windy this is my immediately like my airpod blew out of my ear I'm chasing it

00:54:59.14 down the pier I did this little video of my own face too

00:55:05.14 none of the videos will play for me it's just the still of the beginning and the

00:55:11.16 audience you got it it's just Gavin it's just.

00:55:15.21 Gavin's first one you're missing nothing I'm I'm dead to Andrew I'm serious or

00:55:20.21 I'm saying that what you're seeing in like the first frame is just what the

00:55:24.22 videos are but Gavin is making a case for the elimination of all visual aids

00:55:30.09 going forward I'm saying the goddamn scene right all

00:55:34.11 right so it's too windy now the war is ruined it's not still anymore my airpods

00:55:39.12 are blowing out of my face I'm just like oh God it's hot it's like hot wind it's

00:55:43.15 not nice I'm I'm thinking I'm Gonna Leave the pier now so I'm right at the

00:55:48.06 end of the pier I'm starting to walk all the way back

00:55:50.13 and the wind is just fiercely blowing against me to the point where it's like

00:55:56.04 I'm walking against a wall and uh the the saint killed up here

00:56:00.07 has this interesting like curb thing going up it right you see that on the

00:56:05.18 picture yeah yeah I'm not sure if it's like some sort of water break or I don't

00:56:09.16 know what it's for okay and the map back there okay oh sorry I put it in the.

00:56:14.12 Discord put in the Discord there we go blam nope

00:56:17.14 I gotta go back to this okay yes I see the pier okay yeah you have to alt tab

00:56:24.09 feel like I'm part of a Choose Your Own Adventure

00:56:28.08 so I'm just uh oh you know like a child so I'm walking back up the pier and I'm

00:56:32.21 like jumping up on the curve and like hopping back down but sometimes the wind

00:56:37.10 is so strong I can't like step up onto the curb so I'm like step Against the.

00:56:41.09 Wind I'm getting I'm trying to step up one step and I'm getting blown back like

00:56:45.03 five steps uh I've never really felt wind like it all of a sudden there was

00:56:49.22 one other person on the pier is this sort of probably like 50 year old dude

00:56:53.12 walking the other way walking opposite and I could see him coming the distance

00:56:58.05 and uh I'm I'm trying to step back up on this curb I get blown backwards but the

00:57:03.21 wind is hitting him in the back and suddenly this massive gust slams me

00:57:09.06 backwards like 10 steps and it honestly looked like it lifted him up in the air

00:57:14.08 it was like when we man opened the parachute in front of that fan he went

00:57:20.12 flying he went sailing towards me as I'm

00:57:22.08 going sailing back and uh completely ate

00:57:25.09 [ __ ] over this weird curb to the point where he ended up slumped over it like

00:57:30.14 his legs were on the Y side and his head

00:57:33.14 was on like the narrow side and uh I was like oh Jesus and I'm trying to run

00:57:37.05 towards him but oh he's just pushing it

00:57:39.04 back and I was like [ __ ] oh you're right

00:57:43.09 and uh he stood up and I guess his arm had caught that metal bit oh and as he

00:57:48.23 stood up from like the inside of his elbow to like halfway up his bicep was

00:57:54.10 just gaping open and I was like I was like oh my god oh Jesus and I was like

00:57:59.12 do you want me to call you an ambulance and he was like no no

00:58:04.15 I said absolutely not and I was like no you dude hold that close it's like

00:58:10.13 there's so much blood I can see into your arm and he was like no no no no

00:58:15.17 don't need to happen and I'm like picking up my phone to call an ambulance

00:58:20.04 at this point I realized no idea what the emergency number is in Australia

00:58:23.18 later found out it was zero zero zero but that's good to know now so I didn't

00:58:27.14 know that so I started holding down the power button on the phone because

00:58:33.00 that also lets you call emergency and at

00:58:33.00 that point my phone was going like as in to be like you're about to call

00:58:37.14 emergency he heard that he's like don't do it and I was like but you need you

00:58:41.23 need like 20 stitches man and he's like he's like I'll go on my own and we start

00:58:46.15 walking we start walking back down the pier I'm

00:58:49.23 behind him and uh he's like struggling to hold his arm shut to the point where

00:58:54.19 he stops and uh I'm like do you need me to like do you want me to take my shirt

00:58:58.09 off and like wrap it around you and he's

00:59:01.06 like he was like no no and at that point while he was facing me back down the

00:59:06.22 pier and I'm facing up up the pier the wind kicks up again

00:59:11.21 and it blew what felt like half a pint of his blood all over me

00:59:16.19 in my face in my mouth in my eyes I'm suddenly

00:59:21.01 I watched like a flow of blood come out of his arm and just take to the wind

00:59:26.12 splat it out like a big web and absolutely went all over me and I'm at

00:59:31.17 this point I'm just like oh and I'm like no we gotta go turn around

00:59:37.02 go to that and I'm like oh I'm trying to do it without swallowing

00:59:41.10 like we get to the end of the pier and he's like I'm good from here and I'm

00:59:45.14 like you're not hold on and I and I'm trying to like clean his blood out of my

00:59:49.20 eyes and mouth and in the distance like back through the park I walked through I

00:59:55.02 remember I saw a water fountain so I just sprinted over to it.

00:59:58.05 Lent over it I'm like I need to wash out my eyes and mouth and I'm still not I'm

01:00:02.11 still trying not to swallow his foot so I'm hunched over the water fount in the

01:00:06.20 drinking fountain holding down the button but the freaking wind is blowing

01:00:10.17 all the water away from my mouth I can't get any in my mouth I'm like.

01:00:15.20 Lent over I'm like it's so completely dry and the water's

01:00:20.05 flicking going all over the place so I'm like shimming around in a circle trying

01:00:23.18 to block the wind looking like an insane person watch trying to wash out my eyes

01:00:28.08 and mouth and face and then I I ran back to the end of the pier

01:00:32.11 because I wanted to see what happened to this guy and I can't find him but I can

01:00:36.03 find the blood trail so oh my god did I following these drips of blood and it

01:00:41.00 went to this little car park so I assume he got in a car or like someone was

01:00:44.15 waiting for him in a car or something because he immediately left and there

01:00:48.09 was no more blood and I spent 15-20

01:00:50.12 minutes looking around to see if I could see him all I could see if he'd passed

01:00:53.13 out in a bush or something or see any more blood couldn't find him and then uh

01:00:57.22 I sort of this is where all the pictures have ended by the way no longer provide

01:01:03.10 official AIDS and uh I sort of a thousand yards stared

01:01:08.02 my way back to the hotel and then as I was walking up to the hotel I was like

01:01:13.00 oh I'm covered in blood I'm like I'm covered in what might be a dead guy's

01:01:16.08 blood oh from head to toe and I just I've towered in the front door of the

01:01:21.07 hotel right past the desk straight into the lift took my shirt off I was like

01:01:26.11 scrubbing all the blood off in the bath I took a shower and I ended up just

01:01:31.14 crying in the shower and I was just I ended up just so

01:01:34.21 traumatized by it I was like I can't believe it happened and I didn't really

01:01:38.11 do a good job I couldn't really even help him I hope he's all right and uh I

01:01:43.06 never told anyone that story that whole day I just couldn't bring myself to like

01:01:47.10 bring my mind back to that place oh because I kept seeing like all the

01:01:51.01 intense visuals of his yeah open flesh I'm not very good with blood and then we

01:01:54.10 did like the whole show this was like the end of the show that night where

01:01:58.00 we've been doing uh we've been chugging beer and running around playing America

01:02:01.10 and at some point I just ended up lying on the floor of this stage just

01:02:04.22 reflected as a whole why don't I have a shirt on in this [ __ ] photo

01:02:09.04 I don't know it's the Civil very similar to now yeah so that was a that's my

01:02:14.02 Australia story that was Melbourne um I feel like you encountered Anton

01:02:18.19 sugar on a [ __ ] Pier like that's the only like the unwillingness to get help

01:02:24.21 when his arm is clearly like [ __ ] the guy was aggressively having none of my

01:02:30.10 help he was probably a criminal and he didn't want the cops to come he want the

01:02:34.10 ambulance to comes they said they'd have to run yeah he's probably like it could

01:02:37.16 have been like sure yeah Anton sugar like just some like New York mafia guy

01:02:41.20 who's hiding out in Australia like no police no cops no cops I I was like

01:02:46.03 zoning in and out for the rest of that Australia trip of just like oh God I

01:02:50.02 can't believe what happened and it wasn't even that bad like it's

01:02:54.00 not like I watched someone get hit by a car or something that would

01:02:57.15 be watchful worse it was just the the the speed that he went from just

01:03:01.23 strolling down the pier to severely injured for from nowhere just it like

01:03:06.10 resonated weird with me I was I felt so icky after that I was like oh and then I

01:03:09.23 was also worried that I you know had some sort of yeah foreign blood-borne

01:03:13.15 illness in my eyes and mouth so there was that fear as well I was like do I do

01:03:17.05 do I go to a doctor now like do I tell people about this uh I just didn't know

01:03:22.12 what to do so I end up flying home with a bloody t-shirt

01:03:25.19 s you saved the T-shirt yeah and I don't know if you can tell from the from The.

01:03:30.04 Windy The Windy video I posted earlier nice white t-shirt that was really

01:03:34.15 showed all the blood real good Devin I'm going to show you the perspective I got

01:03:38.20 from your windy video this is what I saw just that and wind blowing

01:03:45.22 this was the other perspective I got it was just this image with the audio of

01:03:51.10 wind blowing that was all the visual aid that I got but I guess I do see the

01:03:56.10 shirt that is a very wide shirt it's a very light shirt and as you can see from

01:04:00.05 the picture of me on stage I changed my shirt you still have the shirt that's

01:04:03.23 covered in blood um I think I've only mainly washed out I

01:04:08.02 don't get washed out because I don't remember it that'd be wild honestly my

01:04:12.10 brain has been it's never seen this is a funny event it just tried to like

01:04:17.02 repress it as much as possible so that's why I don't know why I'd stop taking

01:04:20.12 photos like I should have just it's very unme like to not document what happened

01:04:24.23 afterwards but you were traumatized I mean yeah you were I couldn't believe it

01:04:29.13 experiencing trauma in the moment that is an in you're right it's not funny at

01:04:33.07 all it's like when I told the story about finding the old lady uh who had

01:04:36.12 fallen down in the woods by my house it's like there's nothing funny about it

01:04:40.10 it's just a bizarre circumstance and that's one of the craziest story stories

01:04:45.11 I have ever heard in my life and I can't

01:04:47.04 believe when you teased it the other day

01:04:48.22 you said you were afraid it might be a c story

01:04:55.21 saying I I told Meg and she was she could not believe I never told her yeah

01:05:00.22 at a I was like do you think it'd be good for face and she'd be like oh you

01:05:06.09 gotta tell that on there yeah oh man that also goes to show you how

01:05:11.21 [ __ ] precarious and fragile life is like yeah a gust of wind took that guy

01:05:17.04 out it was I mean In fairness it was a mass

01:05:22.00 it was the probably the biggest wind I've ever felt and I've lived with you

01:05:26.23 for 10 years dude that's a [ __ ] I don't know how

01:05:30.09 you've held on to that story for since 2019.

01:05:34.22 Yeah that you haven't I would be convinced that I was going to be a 28.

01:05:40.04 Days Later zombie immediately yeah you see this I got covered in blood

01:05:43.18 everybody would know I'd be screaming I would not handle that wall

01:05:48.06 no no kidding I would have been like don't touch me I have AIDS I have AIDS

01:05:51.18 now I I have every disease I have I have

01:05:54.19 all the heps I have Hep A through Z just

01:05:57.09 they stay away from me quarantine me and the the thing about like rice I I

01:06:01.05 wouldn't count it as like real trouble it was like slightly traumatizing as an

01:06:04.23 event but it's not like I had PTSD from this event but it is interesting when

01:06:09.20 you have those events and you think about it from very strange angles like a

01:06:14.08 week earlier that guy was just walking about not knowing that a week from now

01:06:19.03 someone from America would come to Australia and end up with his blood in

01:06:22.21 his mouth a week earlier how about eight minutes earlier

01:06:27.09 that guy's relationship with the wind has forever changed every single Breeze

01:06:33.14 it's like this [ __ ] yeah so he's like a wind chime as a warning device

01:06:41.10 closely on the local Melbourne news for the next week well it also just goes to

01:06:47.20 show you like Australians are insane and like in the coolest ways like they just

01:06:52.03 don't give a [ __ ] that guy's like I'll rap it oh he probably wrapped duct tape

01:06:55.12 on and went about his business yeah and they have I assume they have a you know

01:07:00.10 free healthcare like some form of healthcare there are stitches and and uh

01:07:05.14 antibiotics in Australia for sure oh I know a lot of people here don't like to

01:07:09.03 call an ambulance because it costs them money yeah but I'm not sure that's the

01:07:12.17 thing there I don't think you pay for an ambulance

01:07:15.09 okay I'm trying to just process what that would be with the plane like

01:07:18.12 everything that is an insane event to happen how about the fact that like

01:07:22.22 three hours later you and I were hanging out together and you didn't even didn't

01:07:26.11 even cross like I had no idea I think that was the show because it was

01:07:30.14 Melbourne I think that was maybe the show where we filmed that Instagram

01:07:34.06 video of us all singing Wrecking Ball or whatever like the entire group and we

01:07:37.23 were all dancing around together like two hours later you were bathing in

01:07:41.14 somebody else's blood.

01:07:46.18 [Laughter]

01:07:49.01 There's something just so funny about coming back to a hotel room covered in

01:07:54.03 sweat and blood before 9am it was so early that day

01:07:59.12 ah that's got to be one of the worst ways to walk into a hotel lobby because

01:08:04.07 you definitely feel like you definitely feel like you're uh like Jason Bourne in.

01:08:09.02 The Bourne Identity you know like they're just gonna be like uh yeah no

01:08:13.06 problem sir uh yeah calling Interpol right now

01:08:16.02 you said 9am is one of the worst times what is a good time I don't feel like

01:08:19.23 there's a great time to walk into a hotel covered in sweat and blood ah it's

01:08:24.05 just not you just can't sit down with a beer after that it's too early you know

01:08:27.15 yeah

01:08:30.18 and then and I had a long time between that and the Texas

01:08:38.08 um that's it well gav thanks for telling that story

01:08:42.14 that's hands down best stories in the history of face for sure

01:08:46.18 one foot regulation animation one I am oh Jesus oh God oh my God and by the way

01:08:54.07 I'm so sorry this is what a terrible thing to go through that's horrible

01:08:59.12 thankfully you know you look back on it uh fondly I I just hope you didn't die

01:09:04.08 I'm pretty sure he didn't um and if if you didn't it's uh it's a crazy story

01:09:09.07 you know what it reminds me of it reminds me of you and I on the sh on the

01:09:14.02 ferry in Australia going from Sydney uh over to I don't know what what's that.

01:09:20.00 Beach uh that we always would go over to um

01:09:23.06 manly Beach not manly Beach yeah taking the ferry over to manly Beach and we're

01:09:27.04 at the front of that thing and you and I

01:09:29.02 go to drink our water and the wind picks up and it shoots the water all over

01:09:34.12 those two girls in front of us and it was like we couldn't take a sip well

01:09:38.03 they got 80 of our water instantly all through our mouths and into their heads

01:09:43.08 and their hair and they were horrified it was like that blood yeah

01:09:49.07 oh [ __ ] Jesus Andrew what was the thing that you were

01:09:53.11 gonna do that might have pissed off Geoff I can't say because I'm going to do it

01:09:57.16 one day it's now is not the great greatest time to do it

01:10:01.17 and we decided we're sticking with season four through episode 100.

01:10:09.08 Yeah it's been a good season season Four's been good so far yeah it's uh

01:10:14.04 definitely been one of my favorite Seasons yeah I agree with Eric let's

01:10:18.06 keep it rolling Eric you never figured out what year episode 1000 comes out uh

01:10:24.03 it would be so we're roughly at the two year mark uh we started in June of 2020

01:10:29.15 and this will be coming out the day that you can listen to this is uh uh April

01:10:36.07 27th so roughly two years per 100

01:10:39.00 episodes so yeah so it you'd say roughly around that

01:10:42.19 um so we just have to Geoffy Gonna Keep it you keep it going for that long I

01:10:48.03 just mean like health-wise you got like enough like

01:10:51.06 enough like teeth that you can root canal for like 18 more years of this or

01:10:55.13 whatever oh eight sorry I'll be honest I zoned out for a minute uh 18 years so

01:11:00.19 much that's awesome we appreciate it dude yeah cool cool

01:11:04.13 yeah 18 years yeah I could go I can go 18 years here's what we should do even

01:11:09.13 if we don't do this podcast for the next 18 years say it stops at like 200. We

01:11:13.13 come back 18 years from now and just do episode a thousand even if there hasn't

01:11:18.15 been a thousand dude I'm going to be very

01:11:22.10 disappointed if we stop at 200 we I feel like we're building momentum every day

01:11:26.01 and we all the supplement supplemental content starting to come out we're

01:11:29.06 starting to film more do more we got mvp2 ahead of us I imagine what movies

01:11:38.18 should Big Time [ __ ]

01:11:41.15 [Laughter]

01:11:43.13 Would there be more apples to eat I think we should do a bot like if we can

01:11:47.01 get it I think we should do a bovral taste test like we did with the

01:11:50.10 absolutely with the cosmic taste test if Andrew doesn't keep rejecting my

01:11:53.11 shipment maybe he'll be able to try it

01:12:04.16 I'm Canadian and I have it all the time yeah I guess they banned it they banned

01:12:08.17 it with Marmite and like some other thing because it didn't fit food

01:12:13.14 standards in like 20 things and then they had to like change the

01:12:17.05 recipe or they like you can buy it now but there was a time in which it was

01:12:21.19 banned in Canada hates [ __ ] no doorknobs no bovril ha

01:14:27.17 Donkey Kong tie ever we putting that on hey you don't need to if you want you

01:14:31.04 can you can use it if you want just a head piece of clothing I like that works

01:14:34.22 at this company for 10 years and then like twice in the same week I'm being

01:14:38.06 forced to wear two different red ties because I just did a Hitman video where

01:14:42.19 I wore one that preview of you 15 years from now

01:14:46.12 and the bald cap was really funny five maybe

01:14:50.23 uh in all in all seriousness uh is there

01:14:53.21 anything else we need to cover before we

01:14:56.17 before no I think we should do the outro

01:15:00.16 about okay that was it uh uh well [ __ ]

01:15:03.14 that was 100 episodes time flew that's crazy uh actually I do have a question

01:15:08.06 what the [ __ ] is why why it sucks no I just quick it'll be quick is a football

01:15:13.18 a ball this is the thing I was trying to figure

01:15:17.20 out uh uh in what way could it not in what way could it possibly not be a ball

01:15:23.05 well okay so let me give you a more specific hold on I was because it's like

01:15:27.06 I didn't know if it was a thing you know how like a strawberry it says Berry in

01:15:31.01 the name but it's not a berry uh I was wondering because this thing do

01:15:36.09 you do you ever throw a Nerf Vortex Gavin yeah the little whistly thing yeah

01:15:40.23 like was one of my favorite if I was I was thinking about like what are the

01:15:44.05 greatest balls of all time and I think the Nerf Vortex might be number one but

01:15:49.13 I didn't know if it would be considered a ball or not is that a ball it's a

01:15:53.05 football a foam Dot you think it's a foam dart and not a football play Dottie

01:15:57.23 considering the flights on the back but the movement like the throw it's a

01:16:02.21 football product huh which then made me wonder is a

01:16:06.05 football in itself an actual ball or does it does it not follow the ball

01:16:10.20 category despite the name football I mean it's got the name ball in the it's.

01:16:16.02 Ball but so does strawberry but but according it to uh Wikipedia which is

01:16:20.16 never wrong a football is a ball inflated with air used to play one of

01:16:26.04 the various Sports known as football so apparently uh it is yes a ball okay

01:16:31.12 well then I would I would go with the Nerf Vortex as the greatest ball overall

01:16:37.11 what was the best thing on quibby uh I only watched a show it was this horror

01:16:41.19 one with um uh what was the the [ __ ]

01:16:44.10 he was I never saw The Amazing Spider-Man he played the Green Goblin

01:16:47.23 and The Amazing Spider-Man what was his name

01:16:51.20 do you know who I'm talking about I think his name he played Andrew in the

01:16:55.14 movie Chronicle as well I don't know his name he was in it and I believe the

01:17:00.20 female lead was the woman that was in the guest and uh it follows I don't know

01:17:06.01 her name either the woman from it oh what is her name

01:17:10.03 she was like in a bunch of really good Indie movies at the time and I don't

01:17:15.15 feel like I've seen or anything in years

01:17:17.19 uh which is surprising she's great she's great and it follows she's great the

01:17:23.17 guest according to the dictionary of the the definition of a ball is a solid or.

01:17:29.08 Hollow spherical or egg-shaped object that is kick thrown or hit in a game so

01:17:33.02 egg-shaped I think fits yeah egg shapes I think it's fair worth of football yeah

01:17:37.21 yeah it works huh okay there you go what's the name of the guy from The.

01:17:41.21 Amazing Spider-Man that was the Green Green Goblin isn't Willem Dafoe that's

01:17:47.08 not the the one that was with Andrew Garfield The Amazing Spider-Man I know

01:17:52.11 the Green Goblin was in there I think he is the lizard man and uh hold on I'm

01:17:58.19 looking Electric Man uh oh oh oh it's uh what does this get what

01:18:04.08 is this dude's name uh that guy yeah Eric just posted a photo of that guy oh
