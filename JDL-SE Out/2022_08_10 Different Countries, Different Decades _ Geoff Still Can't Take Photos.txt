00:01:09.11 of face starring an American from the 70s a

00:01:12.21 brit from the 80s and a Canadian from the 90s the most diverse podcast cast

00:01:21.16 that consists of three white men different countries different decades wow

00:01:29.16 that was uh that was that was good that was a great idea how was the energy

00:01:34.20 on that one I don't usually do them so I never know fantastic energy very high

00:01:40.11 energy it was a disturbing amount of energy to come from you I'll say and for

00:01:44.13 a second episode too this is yeah yeah you're coming out strong

00:01:48.03 I would say I feel a little lost not knowing what volume or season we're in

00:01:52.02 I'm just gonna take me well I know the [ __ ] answer but I'm not gonna oh my

00:01:56.07 god oh my god what is that 220 I'm sorry while we're doing this I'm watching I

00:02:01.20 forgot uh two weeks ago or last time we recorded uh

00:02:05.12 we I think was episode 113 I mentioned that I had discovered this new sport

00:02:09.07 because of uh comment levers called death diving and I asked if you all were

00:02:13.03 oh yeah oh I forgot about that we're gonna explain uh we were gonna explore

00:02:17.00 it uh because I think it might be a I think there's a real real good chance

00:02:20.20 that it could be uh something that we could get into uh kind of like a like

00:02:25.12 maybe a bean hole thing let me send you a video uh this is a sport from Norway

00:02:30.10 uh it's called death diving um it's a seven minute video I'm not

00:02:34.03 recommending you watch all seven minutes but I would say you'll get a good gist

00:02:39.12 of what's going on around 205.

00:02:39.12 Okay so two five two five okay let's go yeah and then you feel free to bounce

00:02:44.08 around after that but you'll get a sense of what death diving is all right

00:02:48.00 playing fairness Werner groan oh no oh no

00:02:52.02 it's just is it just belly flops is it just the worst oh Jesus Christ

00:02:59.11 that's the

00:03:03.09 how do they is it like splash size and sound like

00:03:07.12 what is the judgment right here I don't I don't exactly know I think but he

00:03:12.09 bottled it because he tucked his head at

00:03:14.03 the last video he also brought his knees up that wasn't a great I think that's I

00:03:17.18 think that's actually a part of it because some of the I don't know I did a

00:03:21.18 bunch of reading on it uh that I don't remember now but uh I think that you're

00:03:25.16 allowed to tuck at the last minute to keep from killing yourself

00:03:29.20 okay yeah because I remember when we went swimming for your birthday Geoff um

00:03:35.12 go go now joey did a belly flop on purpose and yeah he he just swam to the

00:03:40.10 side and just sat quietly for about 20

00:03:43.01 minutes dude so much pain did she call gogo now joey

00:03:47.05 uh yeah I love that name I I'm convinced I gotta get his other friends to call

00:03:53.02 him that make it his actual nickname uh I uh I had a similar thing where I

00:03:57.21 did a dive it wasn't a belly thought but

00:04:00.02 I just landed wrong on my nuts and I had to swim over to the corner by the

00:04:04.17 waterfall for about five minutes and just like just catch my nut breath because

00:04:10.13 I'm so worried about your testicles at the moment

00:04:13.00 vasectomy aside when we were digging the bean hole you were having problems

00:04:16.11 because your nuts were flying all over the place and every time you hit the

00:04:19.17 ground with a hammer dude when you become a big boy your nuts drop and then

00:04:24.07 when you become an old boy your nuts just keep on dropping

00:04:31.03 anyway I think that we should start training and I think I could see gav

00:04:36.02 competing in death diving we just need to go to

00:04:38.17 Norway it's only a competition in Norway but they have like the world

00:04:42.06 championships and stuff and they take it very seriously and uh I feel like we I

00:04:46.13 feel like we could be good at this and has someone died while death diving

00:04:51.23 I don't know uh check out the guy at like 500 like five like four fifty eight

00:04:56.19 five look at that dive yeah let's have a look oh a little smaller younger guy

00:05:02.13 oh he's really pushing he's getting in massive run up he's

00:05:06.12 psyched himself right up look at this it has to be a splashdown right.

00:05:12.14 [Laughter]

00:05:19.22 It's just so ludicrous I've never seen a a graceless dive before but that's what

00:05:26.04 this sport is he was just like a board that's why I that's why he's like a boy

00:05:34.13 he got tense that was perfect according to some people that's [ __ ] crazy

00:05:39.16 that's why I think we can excel I think like if there is any if there is a group

00:05:45.05 of people that are more graceless than us I'd like to meet him

00:05:49.05 yeah I this seems like a lot of potential it's like they removed all the

00:05:54.09 skill and you just have to have pain tolerance yeah if I could

00:05:58.17 if I could change the focus of the company rooster teeth completely and

00:06:04.17 point it in a direction it would be in face getting into professional bean

00:06:10.12 holing and death diving I would put the resources of the 400 person company

00:06:15.12 behind behind just those two things it would be all face all the time and we

00:06:19.19 would be we would probably be training in Norway right now that would be quite

00:06:24.06 the pivot for the company it will confuse people

00:06:26.20 quite the it quite the pivot for a niche

00:06:29.08 sport but you know got to take big risks remember that amazing dive you had Geoff

00:06:34.07 like off the off the boat into the little ring like you went right down the

00:06:37.19 middle they'd boo that they'd get a one they'd get a point five here they

00:06:43.03 [ __ ] hate it yeah I I I think I would come up with like an

00:06:46.20 innovative nut slapper where maybe you could see my [ __ ] nuts reverberate as

00:06:51.12 they hit the water or something or maybe like maybe I feel backwards and so the

00:06:56.09 last thing you see as my body goes under is my nuts floating above me for a

00:07:00.04 second that would be a cool dive if all of these sound like tricks in a tony

00:07:05.03 hawk game I'm even more into it like we just need to keep that going we need the

00:07:10.19 combos I'm all about this death diving oh anyway thanks to the community uh

00:07:15.17 the comment leaders who who posted that on the subreddit that's where I saw it

00:07:19.09 and yeah just because did they post it just because it was very us in vibe

00:07:23.21 yeah I think so I think they were like I don't remember exactly but I think they

00:07:27.14 were like these guys are a water podcast or they're into water sports

00:07:31.07 uh they should check out this sport uh they like to dive so much and then I was

00:07:34.08 like it was like a whole night of my life was just sitting in my in my

00:07:38.11 uh library next to the shelves just watching death diving compilations I've

00:07:42.16 really enjoyed uh building up this newer community of regulation listeners

00:07:46.19 because I feel like so many of them just get it they just yes

00:07:51.09 like even just the act of sending us that is like absolutely yeah no it's

00:07:56.18 perfect like they understand us they're like we got you buddy here you go no

00:08:01.04 it's the best they are the the regulation listeners and the comment

00:08:04.15 levers out of 19 and a half years of of building communities at nothing has come

00:08:08.23 close to those to those people they're phenomenal

00:08:16.15 have you seen the lego animation thing yes

00:08:20.13 I met that guy I met that guy in Atlanta when I was at a convention he was

00:08:25.20 awesome and I've been meaning to he he instagrammed me I suck so bad at ben

00:08:30.00 Davis could tell you this and Rebecca I suck so bad at social media and getting

00:08:34.17 back to people but I [ __ ] I think that kid's brilliant yeah I believe

00:08:37.22 right work his channel

00:08:40.10 yeah I wrote that down I want to talk about that there's also somebody who

00:08:43.20 made a [ __ ] child kicker game I believe that her name is mediocre it was

00:08:48.08 so cool it's amazing I played it with uh Emily

00:08:51.23 for a little bit yeah yeah it's so cool it's just the our the listeners and

00:08:56.03 commently everybody's so sweet and creative and yeah I completely agree we

00:09:00.05 have a wonderful community of people yeah I'm reading into death diving this

00:09:04.22 actually provides some context that makes me like it even more

00:09:08.10 it consists of people jumping from a 10

00:09:10.08 meter high board and landing in the water with their arms and legs spread

00:09:14.03 out like an x and they need to hold the pose for as long as possible before they

00:09:18.02 hit the water so it seems that's the scoring criteria you're trying to get as

00:09:23.07 close to a belly flop as you can without actually getting a belly flop

00:09:26.12 yeah a 30-foot belly flop you said it was 10 meters right 10 meters belly a

00:09:31.02 30-foot belly flop would [ __ ] you up like you could do real damage to your to

00:09:35.19 yourself

00:09:37.18 by the way goes back into why it was so [ __ ] crazy that that idiot jumped off

00:09:43.01 the top of the penny packer bridge in Austin uh and almost died yeah that was

00:09:48.14 120 feet or whatever Jesus just ridiculous he didn't go for the flop

00:09:53.14 though right no I think it was 190 feet no he didn't go for the flop

00:09:59.03 he would have been like he would have been flat like he got run over by

00:10:04.23 by by one of those by one of those rolly things yeah [ __ ] acme cartoon it

00:10:10.02 would have looked like a fatality immortal combat if he went for the flop

00:10:15.20 just all of his skin would shoot off it would have just been that dude's soup

00:10:21.22 de-gloved his whole body

00:10:26.23 this is great I like to support a lot I'm gonna I'm gonna do some more

00:10:31.12 research into death diving thank you I think it's very cool very very cool

00:10:35.08 sharing this it's amazing cena in the since the last recording we've seen a

00:10:40.00 lot of people attempting to draw me on the tea towel just from hearing it

00:10:44.20 absolutely very good attempts it's been so much fun I enjoyed

00:10:48.18 so much looking through that again and realizing all the poor kids that didn't

00:10:52.15 realize it would be copied so like their

00:10:54.15 names are backwards I did not notice all the backwards names on my first look

00:10:58.05 through oh that's backwards names oh a bunch of them are backwards yeah it's

00:11:02.02 fantastic I assume they just scanned it though wouldn't they I don't know but

00:11:05.16 there's a bunch of names that are backwards on that list

00:11:09.16 I don't know how that happens even even Katie uh super fan jack's wife uh sent me

00:11:14.21 her interpretation oh did she really it was very good yeah we uh we got to do

00:11:20.08 something with that like we were talking about maybe you know how we had the ian

00:11:24.10 pocket tee like maybe doing something like that or just

00:11:27.16 just with the picture of Gavin uh on a pocket tee or I don't know it's

00:11:31.13 uh we obviously we need to make tea towels at some point but I want to get

00:11:35.05 the community involved in that yeah um it's just such a it's just such a

00:11:39.12 charming image I don't know how to describe it it's so sweet I'd love maybe

00:11:44.23 next rtx to have an absurdly large tea towel

00:11:48.23 the hairball alone is just my favorite yeah the hairball is great yeah

00:11:52.19 oh so I wish that was a tradition everywhere as you said Geoff I wish I had

00:11:56.20 one of those that I could look back on yeah I think it would be nice to do a

00:12:00.04 shirt that was uh you and Andrew draw yourselves now but then we use my one

00:12:04.02 from 1991

00:12:09.07 that is a pretty funny idea I was telling Gavin I had a real I had a real

00:12:14.18 face of an idea uh but for the record I think gavin's idea is way better

00:12:18.15 direction to go than this but I was thinking wouldn't it be funny

00:12:22.09 uh if we just had one shirt at all times and to to have a new shirt we'd have to

00:12:28.06 discontinue the old shirt so like if you wanted to buy a face shirt right now

00:12:33.09 your only option would be anal passage until

00:12:35.10 we replace it with gavin's tea towel shirt and then it's the only shirt you

00:12:39.07 can get until we come up with another joke and we're only ever allowed to have

00:12:42.14 one shirt in production at any any given time uh but we'd go out of business

00:12:46.19 pretty fast so let's not do that yeah I like it because it's a guaranteed

00:12:52.00 way to lose money well I mean I'm I'm happy that we got

00:12:55.14 given three thousand dollars to buy a suit I can't that was I cannot complain

00:13:00.23 about that that was like and uh you know kudos to to the higher

00:13:05.11 ups at roost for for having some faith in us because uh

00:13:08.10 you know there could be zero return on that investment it very likely could be

00:13:12.08 zero return ever on that investment so it's very sweet of them oh

00:13:16.01 I mean I mean port-a-potty return but yeah that's true I I like this it's

00:13:20.04 worked both ways I think it's it's all gonna be worth it when I see Gavin in

00:13:24.17 that suit I am so excited to see so have we talked

00:13:27.21 about recreating the poster on the podcast we did yes yeah I think so I'm

00:13:32.23 calling it cedar um oh I forgot I emailed Kevin Donovan about it

00:13:37.14 I haven't heard back why wouldn't you stop emailing him I

00:13:41.11 just why I thought it would be a fun piece of trivia I was just like hey

00:13:46.07 [ __ ] you're such a stalker to him now no he's like dude you're not gonna

00:13:49.10 believe that little kid that kept trying to get me on his podcast

00:13:52.23 he hated my movie he just told me he's buying he bought the tuxedo from the

00:13:56.10 movie and he's like I don't know what to do like

00:13:59.00 is he gonna be going through my trash next week no I will never reach out to

00:14:02.13 Kevin Donovan again I hadn't reached out

00:14:04.10 since the last time I attempted to which was months ago because I still have a

00:14:08.09 reaction last time why would you do it again we got away with it I thought it

00:14:12.18 would be wouldn't you want to know if you directed a movie called the tuxedo

00:14:16.13 when you want to know where the tuxedo ended up I would no I think I would hope

00:14:21.12 that it was in good hands and not ours well

00:14:23.17 I would uh the best hands I would argue I'm so excited to see you in the tuxedo

00:14:27.04 because I think you're going to be so terrified about ruining it in some way

00:14:30.19 you know what yeah you should tell them you should tech email them one more time

00:14:35.12 why don't you email them hold on I'm not done uh

00:14:38.07 just saying like hey I just want to let you know we paid three thousand dollars

00:14:41.12 for the tuxedo so I don't know if you want to talk to box office mojo or how

00:14:44.21 this works but maybe you could get that added to the theatrical post

00:14:49.01 boost it up a little bit more for the historical figures a little boost yeah

00:14:53.10 I'd love if there was data somewhere where someone was like why is the tuxedo

00:14:58.17 spiking in interest what is happening like we did

00:15:00.22 with the don zimmer cards where they're like is this like a money laundering

00:15:05.07 scheme what is happening why is this if we could create a rush on the tuxedo in

00:15:10.10 any way that would make me very happy man did I tell you guys that someone

00:15:15.12 some wonderful uh comment leaver uh gave me an autographed don zimmer

00:15:20.06 baseball card at rtx no that's I have it right here I'll take a

00:15:24.10 photo to you incentives it's really [ __ ] cool and it is this it is his

00:15:29.09 signature because I have the I have his uh his little face

00:15:33.09 autographed I saw there was one on break same that I think you opened you have

00:15:37.10 two now or is this the same one that had an autograph a zimmer that had an

00:15:40.09 autograph was it oh there was no that was a baseball that was based on

00:15:43.16 Facebook yeah I have that too okay and this is a card oh that's the worst

00:15:48.04 photo I've ever taken I'm gonna send you

00:15:51.01 the photo please the good photo and then

00:15:51.01 the bad photo I'll just send them both I

00:15:53.12 wonder if we'll be able to tell which is good and which is bad oh yeah you'll be

00:15:59.07 able to tell yeah I'm so excited to find discord oh you're gonna love this uh

00:16:04.06 yeah sure probably.

00:16:17.20 I've never seen that happen you've changed how he's winking

00:16:22.17 you did a live Photoshop I don't know.

00:16:29.12 I didn't do anything differently from photo to photo I swear what that is

00:16:34.12 creepy maybe what if I'm a good photographer but no

00:16:38.21 my phone is possessed what if I am do what do you mean I'm not I want I was a

00:16:44.05 professional photographer I was a [ __ ] photojournalist for five years I

00:16:50.00 won awards I I think it's a much greater chance

00:16:53.06 that my phone is possessed probably by the same demon that possesses Gavin

00:16:56.19 socks that's about to say has Gavin held your phone before because if so that's

00:17:00.05 just cursed you're right you should eventually make a coffee table book of

00:17:04.11 all of Geoff's shittiest [Laughter]

00:17:07.15 [Music]

00:17:08.15 Oh I would hate that to open a photo book and have to like flip the book to

00:17:13.18 the sides and try to get the wrong ones back that'd be so annoying

00:17:18.12 but tree had like not tugging chica to a tree no people would treat their

00:17:22.18 freaking design books

00:17:25.18 that's very funny hey Gavin you're from england and Andrew

00:17:29.16 you're from Canada and Eric you're from america

00:17:33.15 uh are you go I know Eric is but I'm but you guys did when you guys were growing

00:17:38.06 up did they have a thing called the choco taco

00:17:41.07 where you live and I like an ice cream had a feast you didn't have like a

00:17:45.17 little like a taco where the like a crunchy taco where the taco shell is

00:17:50.03 made out of uh like ice cream cone material and inside is ice cream and

00:17:54.15 then chocolate like a hard chocolate top

00:17:56.10 with nuts on it you guys never you never

00:17:58.10 had one I'm very familiar with the choco taco but I don't know if we had in

00:18:02.08 trucks I was always like or whatever yeah I don't think I've seen

00:18:07.08 it in a store either but I associate the

00:18:09.10 choco tacos like an ice cream truck item and I would always go for like the

00:18:13.14 spongebob of bubblegum eyes that would that'd be my go-to I didn't I think

00:18:18.13 I think there is some [ __ ] shenanigans going on right now

00:18:22.02 in america that choco taco has been around my entire life the choco taco was

00:18:25.15 so popular that they sold it at taco bell as the dessert for a while for a

00:18:29.18 couple years uh it's by klondike who's a huge company right

00:18:34.19 they just announced that they are discontinuing the choco taco and it's

00:18:40.01 gonna be gone forever I find it really [ __ ] hard to believe

00:18:44.16 that an iconic dessert like the choco taco that has that has been so

00:18:49.04 successful name another you ever see a drumstick at mcdonald's no because they

00:18:53.09 don't sell those kinds of desserts at fast food restaurants but they were

00:18:57.05 selling the taco bell for years it's everywhere I've never met a person who

00:19:00.11 doesn't love a choco taco they're [ __ ] phenomenal and now they're

00:19:03.19 announcing that they're discontinuing them forever I'm gonna say right here I

00:19:09.12 [ __ ] bet you in less than a year they will bring back due to quote unquote

00:19:14.15 popular demand that choco taco and it'll be everywhere it's [ __ ] they have

00:19:19.16 their they are not removing this that's nonsense they're liars they are

00:19:24.12 as davide as davide on this season of love island uk would say they are a liar

00:19:29.12 they are liars you are liars you're actors that's

00:19:34.21 [ __ ] dude it is [ __ ] it's a total marketing ploy they're taking

00:19:39.05 chocolate tacos away from us to make us miss them so that we can pay more for

00:19:44.04 them when they come back it's just like these goddamn Mexican pizzas and I'm not

00:19:48.00 standing it's just that the machine that

00:19:49.20 makes them broke and there's only one in the country and they're just getting it

00:19:53.11 repaired yeah what is their no what is their reasoning for getting

00:19:57.23 rid of the choco taco I I don't think they sell it really good why

00:20:02.10 remove the choco taco it does look delicious because I I know what the

00:20:07.08 twinkies are delicious I think hostess went out of business right and then some

00:20:12.15 other company bought hostess and then that's why it came back here we go

00:20:16.17 uh unfortunately the choco taco has been discontinued in both the one count and

00:20:21.18 four count packs over the past two years

00:20:24.02 we've experienced an unprecedented spike in demand across our portfolio and we

00:20:29.12 have had to make some very tough decisions to ensure availability of our

00:20:35.05 portfolio nationwide here's why that's [ __ ] do you know I'm a big fan of

00:20:39.11 klondike bars I love klondike bars right you know how many different [ __ ]

00:20:43.23 varieties of klondike bars are there are a thousand different [ __ ] klondike

00:20:48.06 bars I'm pulling them up right now hold on a second no thank you don't want that

00:20:52.04 there is the crunch bar with nestle crunch

00:20:55.22 there's the plain klondike bar there's the reese's klondike bar there's the no

00:21:00.22 sugar added vanilla klondike bar there's the there's the uh

00:21:05.10 the cookies klondike bar there's 37

00:21:07.23 different ways to eat a klondike bar cut one of those cut the crunchy klondike

00:21:12.14 bar and let me keep the choco taco it's [ __ ]

00:21:15.20 criminal it's criminal it'd be hard to make one that's

00:21:19.23 no I don't I don't think I could they make a mint chocolate klondike bar

00:21:25.05 I love mint chocolate but maybe maybe cut that one out and let me keep my

00:21:29.11 choco taco it's even it's it's integral to the full flavor lineup look at this

00:21:34.08 you got you go to their website you want to see

00:21:37.12 the full flavor lineup you're telling me you're telling me

00:21:41.10 look at these [ __ ] desserts you're gonna hold on you're telling me

00:21:45.18 that these [ __ ] sorry I'm trying to pad while I figure out how to

00:21:50.17 upload from a desktop uh you're telling me that these [ __ ]

00:21:57.09 put the clot the first thing you see in the full flavor lineup on their website

00:22:02.22 is a choco taco then a stack of a variety of klondike bars then an ice

00:22:07.09 cream the two different ice cream cookie

00:22:10.00 bar and an ice cream sandwich bar you're telling me the klondike the choco taco

00:22:13.03 isn't doing well enough to compete with those it's it's it's a [ __ ] star

00:22:16.16 player you know what I don't see there a

00:22:18.16 drumstick anywhere to be found they make

00:22:20.16 a million drumsticks but it doesn't make it into the full flavor lineup image

00:22:25.01 because it's not as popular because the choco taco is revered and everybody

00:22:28.21 loves it they are [ __ ] us over we can't let it happen also we should try

00:22:33.04 to make our own I really want one that looks yeah that looks good it's

00:22:36.22 delicious yeah I think it's maybe it's a thing Geoff where people

00:22:40.10 don't appreciate what they have in the choco taco you say that it's been around

00:22:44.07 forever maybe it's just like it's always

00:22:46.03 there people don't appreciate it they're not getting them and this will maybe

00:22:50.02 create a wave I think the closest that I've had to is

00:22:52.22 probably a feast which doesn't have the waffle part but it's like the same sort

00:22:56.02 of chocolatey outside and then there's like

00:22:58.14 a chocolate shell yeah kind of kind of similar property like you wrapped that

00:23:04.00 in a uh in a tortilla a crunchy tortilla made out of uh uh

00:23:07.06 waffle cone and that you'd have that essentially be it I'm having an issue

00:23:11.00 with freezies that has been my summer treat and I don't know is that what you

00:23:14.06 guys call them is that a Canadian thing afterwards last week was cheesies and

00:23:17.20 now it's freezies yeah is it freezies do you know do you have freezies

00:23:26.17 yeah I eat these like uh I probably eat about 12 of these a day

00:23:31.07 yeah I've been struggling to get them because I was told by a grocery store

00:23:36.07 that there is a shortage of the plastic they use to contain them so it's been

00:23:40.04 it's been a struggle it's been a tough summer to get this that has been my

00:23:45.12 great loss as far as I don't think I've ever seen a choco

00:23:49.05 taco in a store in Canada I'm sorry to hear that because they you

00:23:52.10 can get these like these are everywhere in Austin like you go to every grocery

00:23:57.01 store and they're just like all of those yeah exactly those are

00:24:00.12 called freezies at least where I live and uh yeah it's been tough I've

00:24:04.17 struggled to get them I felt I saw a stupid you know how tick-tock has like

00:24:08.09 well you might not because maybe not on tick-tock but tic-tac has a lot of like

00:24:11.13 life hack videos well there's one where you can take one of those and like you

00:24:15.08 snap it in half when it's frozen real fast and then you get like two sides so

00:24:18.19 you don't have to like cut the end off I've tried it with every single one I've

00:24:23.07 uh and I've had zero success I don't believe that's true yeah I think so

00:24:28.18 you're trying to splice what you're trying to like join two together

00:24:33.20 no no you can like when it's frozen supposedly you can just like the way it

00:24:37.08 works gav I know you don't have a lot of uh you don't need a lot of sweets but

00:24:40.15 the way it works is that's frozen and then you just take scissors and you cut

00:24:43.15 the end off and then you squeeze it out but that the life hack on tick tock is

00:24:47.12 you just take it uh both ends and you snap it in the middle oh I see it

00:24:51.07 happens like you have like two two ends it does not work it's not like how

00:24:55.10 wrestlers like they would kind of [ __ ]

00:24:57.18 the shirt up a little bit before ripping it to make it possible I feel like

00:25:01.01 that's what was done with your freezy video yeah it's like when you score

00:25:04.00 something you're about to throw somebody through in a movie yeah exactly

00:25:08.17 do you guys did you guys ever see American

00:25:11.22 what was it called an American American movie no but I'm aware of it I've never

00:25:16.15 seen it there's a scene uh if you haven't seen it it's a documentary about

00:25:21.16 these dudes up in I don't know like Wisconsin or

00:25:24.02 Minnesota or somewhere trying to make a horror movie and they're uh it's it's a

00:25:28.02 really great endearing movie you should watch it yeah those two dudes the dude

00:25:31.11 on the left is the guy he's like the creative guy and then the dude on the

00:25:35.05 right is his best friend mike who's just like a weird stoner metal dude uh and

00:25:38.22 it's just them it's somebody documenting them trying to make their horror movie

00:25:42.19 called coven except they call it coven it's really funny every time they say it

00:25:47.14 and there's a scene where he's in a fight in a kitchen and they score a uh

00:25:53.00 they score like a kitchen cabinet door so they can ram his head through it but

00:25:56.15 they barely score it and it's just a scene of them like ramming his head into

00:26:01.03 this door over and over again and he's like he almost dies he's like

00:26:04.15 maybe we should cut it more and that's what I think about every time

00:26:07.21 I think of scoring oh just watching him get slammed into it I haven't scored

00:26:12.21 anything since that chair that you had at the 4th of July pie [Laughter]

00:26:22.23 dude that's call back joke of the year right that's a great great comeback

00:26:28.00 you were afraid you wouldn't have anything for this episode Gavin

00:26:31.07 whipped that one up that's great I've always wanted to see that

00:26:35.01 documentary have you seen hands on a hard body that's like of course favorite

00:26:39.06 oh it's so good I think it should be required watching for anybody who wants

00:26:43.15 to live in Texas I feel like that movie explains Texas I just I feel like

00:26:48.06 anybody should see it it's such a perfect just all the characters in it

00:26:51.21 are fantastic there's so much natural comedy in it for people that haven't

00:26:56.01 seen it it's uh it documents a competition at a car dealership where

00:27:00.01 people have to hold their hand on a truck and the last person standing wins

00:27:04.06 the truck and it follows like 10 or 12

00:27:06.09 people that are part of this contest and it is incredible there's got everyone

00:27:10.12 from like the young kid who's trying for the first time who needs a car to the

00:27:14.14 grizzled vet who had won in the past and has decided to come back and he's like

00:27:18.07 considered the greatest at this random thing it's awesome great documentary

00:27:23.08 yeah you should you should have you ever seen agave what's the name of it again

00:27:26.18 hands on a hard body no I've not seen it

00:27:29.02 there's oh it's one of my favorite lines

00:27:31.10 from any movie ever where's there's this guy that guy thank you Geoff that is the

00:27:36.10 [ __ ] guy he tells the story about how they got a

00:27:40.00 air conditioner that was for a Walmart installed on their house because they're

00:27:45.07 like we're driving by and they were shutting it down so I got it real cheap

00:27:49.14 and he's like so happy and he is he's missing almost all his teeth and it's so

00:27:53.23 good he's like we got it it was so good and uh when we set it up we didn't

00:27:58.23 realize it would take the house 16 below zero but we quickly learned that it

00:28:02.11 would like it shifts he's so serious too his house

00:28:07.01 he installed an ac unit for a Walmart in

00:28:11.01 his home and it brought it to 16 million

00:28:17.11 it's so good there's this other guy where they're like what's your strategy

00:28:21.21 he's like I'm going to eat a snickers at breakfast I'm going to eat the stickers

00:28:26.00 at lunch it's got all the nutrition I need it's

00:28:28.12 I [ __ ] love hands on a hard body it's amazing

00:28:31.15 yeah it's pretty it's pretty fantastic I want to go back and re-watch it now

00:28:35.10 it's uh it takes place in a city called long view Texas

00:28:40.15 which is uh like east of Tyler so it's like I wanna say northeast of Austin a

00:28:46.00 little bit yeah like maybe maybe about two and a half hours away from us

00:28:51.16 northeast oh that's great oh man good movie two fantastic

00:28:55.16 documentaries that both came out not uh kind of are in the same era like I think

00:28:59.03 I think hands on a hard body came out before American movie but they're both

00:29:03.22 they're both highly uh entertaining documentaries that are uh

00:29:08.04 show the fascinating human condition I'll say that yes they're great [Applause]

00:33:33.22 first time this week it was quite quite the experience eyes wide shut never seen

00:33:40.11 it before never seen it by Stanley a little bit staley kubrick I had no idea

00:33:45.07 I was so wrong of what I thought that movie was about as aware that there was

00:33:50.21 a sex cult in it had no concept of where the story would

00:33:54.08 go wow is it gripping it's a great movie is it good I just I just seen sex cult

00:33:59.00 stuff and never thought to watch it no it's really good I think it's a work of

00:34:03.04 art yeah I think it's brilliant it's one of the it's a beautifully shot film and

00:34:08.02 there's kubrick does such a good job of building

00:34:11.12 tension uh as tom cruise is kind of navigating to get he like he's trying to

00:34:16.19 find his way into this sex cult and just like all the things he does

00:34:21.14 all the directions he kind of goes trying to get there and then when he

00:34:23.03 finally does get it's just it's [ __ ]

00:34:25.18 crazy yeah like I sort of I went in only

00:34:29.01 knowing about probably sort of what you knew Gavin and I assumed that the movie

00:34:34.12 essentially ended with that moment and that it would be like him Nicole kim had

00:34:38.08 joined us the sex cult thing and that's not at all where the story goes and it

00:34:42.20 it leads to a mystery that is fantastic and it's just the lighting in it like

00:34:47.12 the production everything is so [ __ ]

00:34:50.08 good it's perfect it's a great movie well it's because Stanley kubrick

00:34:53.09 doesn't let anyone leave until he shot something 1900 times

00:34:57.00 it's the largest post production on any movie ever I believe I think it was like

00:35:00.12 400 days in post or something like that wow it was his last film I think wasn't

00:35:04.23 it he died four days after submitting the final cut ai technically is his last

00:35:10.07 film but he he died while they were filming that so uh he only filmed the

00:35:14.12 first I think he directed the first like

00:35:16.13 he directed up until the kid gets thrown

00:35:19.09 into the woods and then Steven Spielberg takes over oh wow it's also

00:35:23.21 such a fascinating movie for tom cruise to be in like the concept of him of all

00:35:29.14 people seeing him walk into a cult scenario and how he handles that and

00:35:33.03 with like the current context of tom cru it's just thinking that he has probably

00:35:38.10 seen wilder [ __ ] than what is in this movie is very fascinating yeah

00:35:42.09 it's just like the lobby of scientology what was what was the password was it

00:35:46.09 like it was like lothario it was like yeah yeah it was something like that it

00:35:51.07 was a Latin word I believe and it was related to

00:35:54.12 Mozart and someone yeah what was that it

00:35:57.00 has so many great cameos and cameo might even be a wrong word I just don't know

00:36:00.02 if they're established actors but like Alan tudyk is in it and like one scene

00:36:04.21 and he's great um there's this guy I don't know his name

00:36:08.19 but he plays Russians and movies all the time and he was in mission impossible

00:36:12.14 too I thought oh that's so weird that you would be in a later tom cruise movie

00:36:18.04 he owns like a costume store uh in the film there are few actors in that um

00:36:22.03 Thomas Gibson from criminal minds has like a really weird role there's a lot

00:36:26.17 of like people that you recognize in it man I will say too uh

00:36:29.21 tom cruise and Nicole Kidman you know they were obviously married when they

00:36:33.09 made this movie and obviously and then they you know got divorced and then tom

00:36:38.21 cruise is uh gone his route and she went hers uh but in that film they like

00:36:44.03 you're like god damn these are two beautiful people who are in love

00:36:48.03 together and having a life together they fit so well together they looked

00:36:52.07 so they had so much I thought they had so much chemistry like actual chemistry

00:36:56.01 you could really I don't know they seemed like they had something really

00:37:00.13 special going it's just good actors yeah to read about it seemed like a lot

00:37:05.14 of the production on it um [ __ ] with their marriage in a lot of

00:37:08.14 ways like they had to do really serious counseling as part of the movie and it

00:37:12.16 was like Stanley kubrick sort of created the divide that their characters had

00:37:16.08 within the context of the story in their own personal life it's really

00:37:20.13 fascinating to read about yeah I read a like uh

00:37:24.12 kubrick probably did a uh had a lot of questions like stuff that would be

00:37:28.22 considered very questionable now in his directing practices and and the way he

00:37:32.17 like exerted control over things absolutely Eric said big time yeah big

00:37:36.21 time same with uh all those like Hitchcock as well really

00:37:40.23 I'm not as familiar with him in those practices I remember like Harvey keitel

00:37:45.19 I think has a story where he was in some kubrick movie and he made him open a

00:37:50.01 door like 70 different times and he said [ __ ] you and quit so you just have to

00:37:54.00 recast

00:37:56.08 yeah I think I appreciate that was eyes wide shut was it I I'm pretty sure I'm

00:38:02.00 pretty sure that was eyes white shut that's awesome I didn't I feel like I

00:38:05.12 like a lot of story kubrick's technical stuff like a lot of the developmental

00:38:09.09 things gone into camera equipment that started with him but god I would have

00:38:13.20 hated to be on the other side like I would have been I would have not wanted

00:38:18.10 to wake up every day and go dude deal with that Jesus

00:38:21.16 I I [ __ ] mike's well I've never like I think all sets suck I I imagine

00:38:26.07 Stanley kubrick's probably were way worse but I don't think

00:38:29.11 movie sets aren't fun no I mean it's it's like uh it's crunch is what it is

00:38:34.02 yeah it's like I don't people people don't I

00:38:37.12 it's such a stressful environment to be in whether you're [ __ ] small potatoes

00:38:41.14 or big or big production it's that's a stressful way to make a living

00:38:45.13 high stress but very it's it's always fulfilling at the end I

00:38:49.04 feel like the longest yeah the longest I worked on a film was probably two weeks

00:38:52.12 and at the end of it I was just exhausted and a zombie but I do look

00:38:56.02 back on it fondly it's like oh there's some stuff I did on

00:38:58.21 in a movie that's exactly what Eric said they

00:39:01.18 they're great for stories but they suck to be in totally what what movie was

00:39:06.17 that the was that the Sherlock Holmes yeah just because I had so much slo-mo

00:39:10.14 like I only did slow-mo so it's not like I would work on a film for its entire

00:39:15.09 run but there was like a two or two or three week shoot just on phantoms

00:39:20.03 weren't you also like if I'm just going off memory weren't you also shooting in

00:39:23.21 the snow somewhere out in the middle of nowhere train stuff or something or was

00:39:28.17 that a different movie uh that might have been snow white in

00:39:31.07 the huntsman but that was fake snow I just remember you being cold and

00:39:34.20 miserable no I've definitely been cold and miserable I don't know if it's for a

00:39:38.15 film.

00:39:41.03 I mean england in the winter is is that it's called of Israel

00:39:47.14 I don't I think I've only seen eyes wide shut and the shining from from kubrick

00:39:53.11 is is it those stories or is he just remarkably good at making his whole

00:39:58.12 world seem interesting like every aspect of the world that his

00:40:02.12 stories take place in are things I want to explore and know more information

00:40:07.16 about and he does such a good job of containing what that information is yeah

00:40:11.09 there are very few true auteurs in the world and I think he would I think he

00:40:16.17 would probably be one of the most successful and most prolific he he

00:40:21.05 exerted David lynch like this too exerted such control over every

00:40:26.08 it all feels delicious every element of the yeah it does and it is and I think

00:40:31.11 it takes a probably a really unhealthy mind to be able to to focus

00:40:35.22 that much attention on something for that long like I remember uh

00:40:40.19 I remember reading when lost highway came out uh which is one of my favorite

00:40:44.09 David lynch films and I think a fantastic film if you can get past the

00:40:47.18 bad music um like ramstein and [ __ ] uh

00:40:52.08 but I remember reading before the movie came out that like David lynch designed

00:40:58.02 all the furniture in the film because he couldn't find

00:41:01.00 when he was trying to design bill pull man's house he couldn't figure out

00:41:04.23 he just couldn't get it to look right so he's like [ __ ] it I'll just build all

00:41:08.15 the furniture myself and he's a he's a really talented uh furniture maker so he

00:41:11.20 did and I remember thinking like that's [ __ ] cool but now when I think back

00:41:15.03 and I'm like Jesus Christ man just go to Ikea like [ __ ]

00:41:19.03 my favorite cooper thing is Barry lyndon which is a movie that I don't think a

00:41:24.13 lot of people like talk about with kubrick but he shot it with no

00:41:29.12 it's a period piece and he shot it with no artificial light

00:41:34.04 and had to use like special lenses that they had to like develop or they were

00:41:38.17 used by NASA on the moon because everything was lit with natural

00:41:43.14 light or candle yeah I think it's because and because film at the time wasn't

00:41:48.04 incredibly sensitive there was like f stops on lens but he had like f zero

00:41:53.00 point something it was like to the point where a sliver like a piece of fabric

00:41:57.18 thickness of focus that you've got now and I was on film when you couldn't even

00:42:02.08 really tell if you were getting it like the film bouncing further away and

00:42:06.03 towards the little you know lens gate would have affected the focus at that

00:42:10.03 point horrendous crazy I should do a deep dive on kubrick I've never seen

00:42:14.13 full metal jacket I've always wanted to see oh my god dude full metal jacket

00:42:18.16 isn't it that is uh that is an intense first off I'm gonna lay it's a long ass

00:42:22.23 [ __ ] movie like it's one of those movies where

00:42:25.20 the first half is ba I'm not gonna spoil anything of that film for you because

00:42:30.06 it's a phenomenal movie and it's was it was actually private joker was uh

00:42:35.09 influential and why I became a journalist in the army

00:42:38.07 because he's a he was a journalist in the military in the marines the young

00:42:41.12 Matthew modine yeah Matthew Matthew modine was like he rubbed off on me and

00:42:44.20 I wanted I kind of wanted to to be like him um when I was a kid I don't know uh

00:42:48.10 in that I just thought that was if you're gonna be in the military that's a

00:42:51.16 cool way to do it um Eric said we're a good real podcast now

00:42:56.08 four white guys talking about how good kubrick is

00:43:00.01 uh but it's like there's like an entire film just in basic training and then you

00:43:04.07 think the movie's over when that's over and there's like oh no you have a whole

00:43:07.10 other [ __ ] film that happens that's like a totally shifts gears and it's

00:43:13.01 just like it's insane it's intense and that's Vincent d'onofrio turns in

00:43:17.16 one of the most disturbing performances you will

00:43:21.12 ever see on film really more disturbing than him in men in black

00:43:26.18 yeah he's great in men and black too Danny boyle is great at that making

00:43:31.10 movies that have tonal shifts in the last act but they work

00:43:35.00 like train spotting shifts into like kind of a heist movie at the end

00:43:38.07 sunshine becomes like a murder thriller like there's a real genre change in a

00:43:42.01 lot of this work I don't feel like sunshine gets enough credit that's a

00:43:45.01 really great film it's a great movie yeah or enough recognition I guess that's

00:43:49.14 really good you'd like it sci-fi it's real good

00:43:52.08 yeah I'll catch up on space movies like sunshine and I've never seen event

00:43:56.10 horizon which is apparently important to

00:43:59.16 watch oh the horizon's it's a good movie it's yeah it's like

00:44:02.17 probably probably dated now but it's uh it's a scary movie too kind of yeah it's

00:44:06.19 a good horror movie it's a movie podcast you know wes Anderson does that a lot

00:44:10.12 too where you're like singing totally second

00:44:13.11 half of the film's a totally different movie Jesus Christ yeah

00:44:19.06 let's stop talking about movies

00:44:22.17 because you know there's someone listening who's seen

00:44:26.09 none of those films or who's seen all of

00:44:28.08 them and it's like hey [ __ ] up [ __ ] off

00:44:30.03 you don't know what you're talking about this is exciting when you watch a movie

00:44:33.06 like that like in eyes wide shut sorry to go back to movies immediately there's

00:44:36.21 a scene where tom cruise is reading a news story about an event that happened

00:44:40.15 in the movie and I wanted to pause the film to read it and I've never had that

00:44:46.00 with a movie it was like everything felt so detailed and was so

00:44:50.20 engaging to pursue oh speaking of movies.

00:44:54.06 I don't I don't ever really watch movies anymore

00:44:57.20 uh you know I don't have the attention span but my mom's in town and so we

00:45:02.04 wanted to do some last night so I watched that movie the gray man on

00:45:05.12 Netflix the new Ryan gosling Chris Evans movie have you guys seen that no

00:45:09.17 pretty good pretty good it's kind of like a born identity like uh they're

00:45:12.18 saying it might be like a new big franchise where it's like Ryan gosling

00:45:16.00 plays like a Jason bourne type character and then Chris Evans is the bad guy

00:45:20.04 it's fun got billy bob Thornton in it I'm walking away from this podcast with

00:45:23.08 like five things to watch two documentaries got some kubrick films I'm

00:45:27.10 walking away from this knowing that if Stanley kubrick was alive we'd still

00:45:30.16 have a choco taco that's what uh my main takeaway

00:45:33.18 I can all tie it back I'm telling you guys I'm gonna be vindicated when you are

00:45:38.20 seven or eight months they're gonna be like the

00:45:42.04 back but you demanded it so we're bringing it back

00:45:45.05 the choco taco they only took it away I promise you it's only been taken away

00:45:50.10 so that they can give it back to us you're totally right like undeniably

00:45:53.21 that's what's gonna happen I think my favorite

00:45:56.15 one of those type stories like hostess went on business somebody re-bottom

00:46:00.09 brought back the uh the twinkie I believe that's what happened with that

00:46:05.01 chuck e cheese was the thing when it started it gained

00:46:08.15 popularity and they were gonna strike a deal with this investor and they pulled

00:46:12.23 out at the last minute it was like [ __ ]

00:46:15.09 you we can make our own thing so they started showtime pizza which was like

00:46:19.22 the same idea animatronics arcade showbiz pizza showbiz thank you yes

00:46:24.02 showbiz pizza they were gonna partner with chuck e cheese then they backed out

00:46:29.16 of the deal made showbiz pizza chuck e cheese overextended went

00:46:32.22 bankrupt showbiz pizza then bought chuck e cheese then got rid of their own

00:46:37.03 company name and called everything chuck e cheese so chuck e cheese is really

00:46:41.05 showbiz pizza now and it's all failing so who cares but I just think it's such

00:46:44.22 a wild thing of being like [ __ ] you I could do it better and then just

00:46:48.08 absorbing the company that started it all and pretending that you're them

00:46:52.08 and honestly they did like that was my childhood I was of the era when these

00:46:56.07 things came out so that was like those were birthday parties for me showbiz was

00:46:59.19 way better than chuck e cheese way better than chuck e cheese they had a

00:47:03.09 much better show the animatronic show was the concert

00:47:06.13 they would put on was so [ __ ] good what was that band called

00:47:10.13 have you ever seen the uh concept unification video no

00:47:14.02 it's where they're like stripping all the fur off one brand and like

00:47:18.07 re-branding the animatronics with the other brand and it's like an

00:47:22.15 instructional video it's like now tear this piece off and shove the

00:47:27.20 the eyes on this one it's gruesome that's hideous that is hideous they were

00:47:31.20 called the rock-a-fire explosion they had like they had a [ __ ] they

00:47:36.13 had a I don't know if it was yeah it was they had a gorilla in like a tuxedo who

00:47:40.17 was [ __ ] awesome that's great he played the keyboard I think that's

00:47:44.12 [ __ ] cool do you have anything like that growing

00:47:46.21 up Gavin uh no what about like arcades was there any arcade scene uh yeah I I

00:47:52.04 lived in a really small town I don't really have that's fair I I mean I feel

00:47:55.19 like I had the similar I had a place called cyber city and it sucked but

00:48:00.19 that's like that's what we had oh there's a concept unification tape uh

00:48:05.12 like some vhs they sent to all of the locations and it's just so creepy

00:48:10.12 was there like because like when I grew up there were

00:48:13.03 arcades in town obviously but you don't have access to them unless you get your

00:48:16.19 mom to take you which is a rarity so like there was like

00:48:20.21 there was a one Walmart that I could ride my bike to that had street fighter

00:48:25.20 2 and Ivan iron man's off-road and so those were my access to video

00:48:31.12 games did you have like a gas station or something gav or like a restaurant that

00:48:36.01 just had like like one arcade machine in the back

00:48:38.10 they're like all the time there's like a tub with a fruit machine in it though.

00:48:41.16 [Music]

00:48:43.05 [Laughter]

00:48:44.17 like a slot machine not for not a vending machine for fruit

00:48:50.00 [ __ ] out of bananas again but even at the point of this thing so

00:48:54.23 were arcade arcade machines just not like popular in the uk no they were just

00:48:59.12 it didn't live near anything like that yeah it's crazy to me to hear people uh

00:49:03.20 sort of like from your generation Geoff talking about like 7-11 being a hangout

00:49:08.08 spot because it had a mortal kombat cabinet in it like that just being a

00:49:12.13 place that people would hang out to play games oh yeah interesting there was uh

00:49:17.06 not a 7-eleven but in a different area different place when I lived in Florida

00:49:21.12 there was a tom thumb is what it was called there and they had golden axe and

00:49:26.19 um altered beast and so like half the kids in town just

00:49:31.07 hung out at the tom thumb taking turns on golden axe and altered beast and that

00:49:36.15 was just like yeah that was your access to video games back then yeah

00:49:41.02 wild yeah it's talk of like discontinued ice cream it just made me

00:49:45.18 remember when did you did you have anything similar to

00:49:49.16 we had it we had a viennetta which was like a

00:49:52.05 I would say it was like an ice cream lasagne thing that you like carve off

00:49:56.12 slices of did you have anything like this dude I had never seen or heard of the

00:50:03.03 vianetta before but my girlfriend grew up with those so we did have them in

00:50:08.14 america she said that was like her mom would buy one of those when company

00:50:12.12 would come over like that was like the fancy dessert you get like when you're

00:50:16.04 having when you're having a dinner for like the people in the neighborhood or

00:50:19.14 for your church group or whatever on a Sunday night and they would pull out the

00:50:22.17 vianetta and it would be like a big [ __ ] deal yeah I remember it fondly

00:50:26.23 of like if it's like a Sunday dinner but also

00:50:29.02 some grandparents have also come over that's where vienetta gets bored

00:50:34.19 oh that's great I I don't remember every viennetta for me it was like the mccain

00:50:40.10 deep and delicious cake that was like oh you're at a school

00:50:43.01 event like that is the the official cake of any like adult run event where kids

00:50:47.03 are at always have cocaine steep and delicious I don't know if you can before

00:50:52.00 nah nah I've never heard of it let me see if I can find a photo I feel like uh

00:50:56.02 I feel like it's been done to death uh it's like been meme to death but

00:50:59.18 andrew's looking for that this was my version of the viennetta when I was a kid

00:51:04.17 we had yeah is that it is that it that's that

00:51:07.12 that's it but Eric just posted what is that called it's a like a mccain deep

00:51:11.13 and delicious cake but it's not it's not it's just a cake it's just a cake yeah

00:51:16.12 there wasn't like an ice cream thing we had grown up fudgy the whale

00:51:20.23 fudgy the whale's great budgie the whale

00:51:23.17 was the [ __ ] dude that was like if you were you were lucky if your mom would

00:51:26.23 get you fudgy the whale for your birthday oh god

00:51:30.10 as an ice cream cake right uh-huh yeah it's ice cream cake we have so many

00:51:34.21 possible food gauntlet challenges to do like we've already got crisps

00:51:39.12 ready to go we can easily do ice cream oh [ __ ]

00:51:44.14 cookie puss I remember cookie puss Geoff no I never had a cookie puss but

00:51:49.21 I'd see the commercials on tv oh what is that cookies got cookies

00:51:55.05 at a cone for a nose the the only reason I know what this is is there was some

00:52:00.13 Howard stern fight that he got in with Fred where he was making fun of him

00:52:05.14 buying a cookie puss and a cookie opus for like 15 minutes

00:52:09.14 Fred is seething and it's just Howard with a voice changer saying cookie

00:52:14.13 o'puss over and over again [ __ ]

00:52:17.09 crying thinking about it is the best it's great but like does this look like

00:52:22.15 a like it I feel like it's supposed to look like a

00:52:26.10 cat or like why would his name be cookie put I don't know it doesn't make sense

00:52:31.09 to me no whiskers yeah I don't know I love his little hands oh

00:52:36.00 it looks like a tea towel drawing a child would make yeah I think that

00:52:40.07 I think Gavin you see his like his like smile and then to the right there are

00:52:43.18 the two verticals those are like little hands sticking out those are like little

00:52:47.02 red gloves [Music]

00:52:48.17 how would you eat ice cream cake with a fork no but like what would you put it

00:52:55.00 on this was a real oh I put it in my mouth great very helpful good bit yeah

00:53:00.21 where would you put it well I would always because it's cake in my mind I

00:53:05.08 associate cake as a plate food so I'd always put ice cream cake on a plate but

00:53:09.08 then it melts and becomes a mess I up until like a few months ago have

00:53:12.23 switched to bowls never even occurred to

00:53:14.16 me to use a bunch of ice cream is always a bowl food but it's a cake so my brain

00:53:18.17 would always put it at ice cream part at kids parties it it ends up on a little

00:53:22.11 plastic it ends up on a cake so it's but it makes no sense it's a terrible ice

00:53:26.17 cream should never be served on a plate but I that's how I did it

00:53:30.14 I don't think kids at birthday parties let the ice cream sit long enough to uh

00:53:35.10 it's gone in like point two seconds you when you're a kid and you get up you get

00:53:39.15 birthday cake and and then if that birthday cake is ice cream birthday cake

00:53:43.16 it's gone dude it is it's [ __ ] gone there's no opportunity

00:53:47.11 for that ice cream to melt eric's wife won't eat cake and ice cream

00:53:51.16 together why she doesn't like them together she

00:53:54.08 doesn't like ice cream cake she doesn't like if there's cake and ice cream they

00:53:58.02 can't touch uh they have to be separate is she like that with other food

00:54:04.13 not not really I'm sure there's one or two other things probably but by and

00:54:09.20 large no but for some reason cake and ice cream is a very contentious thing

00:54:15.01 where she is uh they can't touch they shouldn't ever touch she'll eat the cake

00:54:19.03 and then she'll eat the ice cream or vice versa they they just shouldn't be

00:54:25.03 together is um her feeling I would recommend that you never dig into that

00:54:29.11 because that kind of trauma comes from something really dark in her life

00:54:33.09 probably it's probably she probably better just not left thinking about it

00:54:36.18 see I for me it's a texture thing I could see that just being unpleasant

00:54:40.04 those two textures not mixing so like sponge cake I I agree I think that's

00:54:44.14 what it is and I'm sorry Gavin like plug your ears for a second but I think it's

00:54:49.03 her I think it's like a wet bread situation for her yeah I think

00:54:53.20 I think that that like those things are such a perfect pairing texturally for me

00:54:58.16 I absolutely agree I totally agree I'm just I'm speculating on what I think it

00:55:02.06 might be they're just certain things though that

00:55:04.12 you don't like for me like apples and peanut butter I hate that but I love

00:55:08.05 them individually do you know if she ever witnessed a murder during a

00:55:11.21 birthday party or anything yeah she was eating cookie puss and then as she took

00:55:17.11 a bite uh a man died and that I think that might be it

00:55:21.03 might have been a cookie opus but I can't be sure

00:55:24.07 I'm sorry what were you saying Andrew I don't even remember I'm just now

00:55:28.05 imagining a cookie puss murder I guess we could really narrow down timing year

00:55:31.16 you're never getting a cookie opus outside of st patrick's day good luck

00:55:35.08 finding one you don't like apples and peanut butter together

00:55:38.10 not together that's what I was saying yeah thank you that actually was what

00:55:41.18 I'm saying I don't like them together I enjoy them both separately if I get them

00:55:45.14 on a plate I'll eat them both individually I will not

00:55:50.15 I'll just eat peanut butter by itself yeah and they'll eat the apples by

00:55:54.17 themselves huh but you would never dip an apple slice

00:55:57.19 I've tried like I've had it and I just don't I don't like it but I like them

00:56:02.19 both individually a lot I think how about caramel we ever do like

00:56:06.02 that's good yeah that could be good yeah so it's not like a consistency thing

00:56:10.02 it's no it's just it's like a weird yeah I don't know why it's the taste doesn't

00:56:13.17 blend for me hey man that's fair that's fair I get that I had a uh I had a

00:56:18.12 babysitter when I was a kid who was obsessed with

00:56:22.09 eating peanut butter with cheerios in it

00:56:24.10 and that's the only snack she would make me because it was the only snack she

00:56:27.12 knew how to make and she would just sit there and watch mtv and make me eat

00:56:30.20 cheerios and peanut butter and she thought it was the best thing ever

00:56:34.14 what so how would that work she just don't she would dump a bunch of

00:56:38.14 peanut butter in a bowl and then pour cheerios on top of it and then give me a

00:56:42.05 spoon that's a terrible treat and then she would eat it too and it wasn't like

00:56:45.13 a torture because she was eating it too did you like it didn't sound that bad

00:56:49.01 actually well what type of cheerios are we talking like a honey nut are we

00:56:53.18 talking to base cheerio this is like 1986 so we're talking straight ass

00:56:57.23 cheerios okay I'll eat cheerios and peanut butter from time to time I just

00:57:02.11 think it's insane to say that she made it for you and that it's the only thing

00:57:07.05 she knew how to make yeah this is all I can get

00:57:10.21 peanut butter and cheerios nothing's being made

00:57:14.09 so what you need that do I yeah yeah yeah you get like a spoonful of peanut

00:57:18.23 butter and like not like full but like a little bit of peanut butter and then

00:57:22.10 like some cheerios it's like a nice like little quick snack [Laughter]

00:57:26.11 you you and my babysitter in 1986 are the only people I've ever met that

00:57:31.05 particularly we're both well we're both chefs I have no idea

00:57:36.17 what is the base cheerio is it the one what's the one with like three different

00:57:42.08 cheerio types the face cheerio is the one with three different cheerios in it

00:57:48.10 so wait this cause I only remember that one and and

00:57:51.20 honey nut cheerio what what were the three flavors I'm not even familiar with

00:57:57.11 what that is what are you talking about that was

00:58:00.21 like this like the white cheerio and there's like the brown one excuse me

00:58:04.22 you're asking again you're asking if the

00:58:07.06 base cheerio is three different kinds of cheerios there's another thing that was

00:58:11.07 like the box standard cheerio was it it was like this song was like cheer

00:58:16.17 cheerios cheery corn what cherry

00:58:20.17 what's

00:58:24.04 snack attack once again like it's an experience we all have this is some

00:58:29.05 crazy British [ __ ] what are you oh hold on cheerio I was wondering who haven't

00:58:34.20 seen him in a while there's a song yeah something's up there cheerios

00:58:39.14 sorry I'm so cheerios so good to eat that was the song

00:58:44.12 that was so good now let me find her Gavin

00:58:47.16 Geoff you've been around longer than all of us have you ever heard the cheerio

00:58:51.14 song no no no no I've also never heard of white was it white and wheat

00:59:00.21 notes something like

00:59:10.17 here we go yeah look look at this look at this freaking ad it wasn't oats I

00:59:16.04 don't think I think it was chewy wheat I'm watching this cheery wheat it was

00:59:21.20 what this is nutritious there aren't they're delicious

00:59:26.00 this is trying to be so American dude [Music]

00:59:32.17 but you guys are you're this is the uk trying to be so American by eating

00:59:37.22 non-American cheerios so I think they're they're all the same but they've they

00:59:42.18 just listed the four things so maybe that's what no I don't think so dude

00:59:46.13 because they those they have different colors in the

00:59:49.22 yeah they were definitely different colors yes so it's mean

00:59:54.00 that's the bog standard cheerio and then you've got the honey nut cheerios so

00:59:58.19 what you just had like cheerios I put the paper above it you

01:00:03.07 see like when they show like the four colors and there's like the really beige

01:00:07.03 one that's cheerios that's cheerios it's just plain shares what you're

01:00:12.02 describing we have a version of that in america it's called checks so we have

01:00:16.00 there's like rice chex and corn chex and wheat chex and there's no like bog

01:00:20.04 standard chex because they're all different flavors but yeah cheerios is just

01:00:24.19 it's just that yellow ass box that's above it right there those those

01:00:28.23 strawberries in the bowl those don't come with it those are add-ons

01:00:32.17 there's so many of these that must be where I remember the song is because

01:00:36.06 that was why I kind of barely remembered the song

01:00:39.07 but I just remembered there was a song because it was there's so many different

01:00:43.14 years where they played that sort of [ __ ]

01:00:47.01 these are terrible it's very American corn rice oats

01:00:50.12 wheat I can't even find that product it's all like amber waves of grain and

01:00:55.22 people jumping in a lake and like throwing water on each other

01:01:03.01 wow we just had such similar but different lives yeah

01:01:07.18 here's the cheerios cheerios commercial I remember when I was a kid let's see

01:01:12.15 this toasted oat cereal ah this is cool yours

01:01:16.06 was animated yeah it's jack and the beans it went into his bicep I got toast

01:01:23.14 that's boom [ __ ] right there [Laughter]

01:01:29.14 Andrew how do they advertise cheerios in Canada Canadian cheerio I don't remem I

01:01:35.17 just feel like it was kids eating cereal

01:01:38.15 like I don't think we had animation or a cool song I don't remember

01:01:41.22 anything like that cheerios commercial I'm looking oh here we go Canadian ad

01:01:46.00 cheerios I stepped away from cheerios knowing the ingredients here I have not

01:01:51.01 seen this this is just this is a Canadian Canadian this is so [ __ ] bland

01:01:56.17 yeah like cheerios like Canada like Canadians must be the most patient

01:02:02.06 people in the world because my god that was just like the slowest commercial

01:02:06.12 I've ever seen in my life it's just sad thirty second seminar and why cheerios

01:02:11.01 don't have any flavor

01:02:14.04 yeah that one's definitely marketed at the moms not the kids yeah

01:02:19.03 I like the final five seconds so we got to do something explode the [ __ ] box

01:02:23.03 let's have them all fall in the milk at once like we did anything we need

01:02:26.21 anything this stinks

01:02:30.23 it's like Michael mcsteer at the end a bunch of cheerios just fly into that

01:02:35.14 woman's bicep it's like they had Michael bay for two

01:02:39.04 seconds of footage like that's all they could book

01:02:42.23 why I think he was uh it was Stanley kubrick for the first half and then

01:02:47.14 do you know how many times it took for them to pour that bowl of cereal

01:02:51.10 800 ticks I gotta be honest I after watching the three I feel a little

01:02:55.22 ripped off I think you had so many flavors in your cheerios

01:03:00.00 yeah I wanna I wanna try British cheerios now I want to hear from other

01:03:03.17 people from england because I may have just missed it but was there a

01:03:07.12 a bog standard plain single cheerio that wasn't honey nut do let me know in the

01:03:12.04 comments become a comment leaver if you feel like this is worth doing so it's

01:03:17.22 gonna it's gonna have to happen eventually it might as well be about

01:03:21.05 cheerios it's true well we're all it's like it's like infection and halo we're

01:03:25.03 all gonna get infected as a comet leaver at some point so you might as well just

01:03:28.23 accept it we should start selling like comment lever care packages like a

01:03:33.22 little relief package for when you finally make the decision do you remember

01:03:39.12 we talked about a long long time ago having an official face apology basket

01:03:45.02 that we gave to people yeah the guilt basket we got to get on

01:03:48.18 that we should we really do need to design and build a physical guilt basket

01:03:52.19 that we can give out to people I think that'd be very funny I'll start on the

01:03:55.23 basket and it would have I I gotta think it's got British cheerios in it.

01:04:01.05 [Laughter]

01:04:02.12 like a little travel size British cheerios did you guys have that in

01:04:05.20 england did you have like the little one size like one uh like one portion size

01:04:10.10 yeah they had all the different types of kellogg's yeah you had like frosted

01:04:15.05 flakes and no one ever ate the ricicles ricicles uh nobody knows what they're

01:04:20.02 talking about how how do we keep getting so close

01:04:22.22 you say something that's so like [ __ ]

01:04:26.12 bizarre it just stops you've never had rice cichlids right

01:04:31.07 are you talking about rice krispies we had rice krispies but we also had

01:04:35.22 what the [ __ ]

01:04:37.12 ricicles it's just I'm looking at it it's a rice krispie no no you're wrong

01:04:42.06 it isn't and this will be a part of our cereal gauntlet

01:04:46.16 how is it different they look identical

01:04:51.05 they're definitely different they don't taste anything like rice krispies

01:04:56.06 captain rick this is wild but anyway in the big multi-pack it

01:05:00.03 would always be like people will be scarfing down the the crunchiness and

01:05:04.02 the cocoa pops but ricicles would always

01:05:05.22 be left in the end of the bag so they're

01:05:08.10 just not good I just didn't think it was anyone's favorite the frosties would be

01:05:11.16 sucked down immediately but the the fry I've seen that's frosted flakes frosties

01:05:16.20 yeah it's frosties for us oh yeah did you guys have tony the tiger you did

01:05:21.01 yeah yeah yeah do you guys call him tony the tiger or did he have a different

01:05:25.12 name in england he's not like Anthony he's not like Anthony the hero

01:05:30.01 or anything what the [ __ ] a honey loop I don't

01:05:33.07 know I think this is a more a modern version because I don't remember

01:05:38.13 multi-grain shapes or honey loops I remember icicles being in there though huh

01:05:43.11 honey loop it's not like a honey o dude I don't know oh yeah it does it

01:05:48.23 looks just like a honey oh okay money is a post food podcast

01:06:02.20 you say [ __ ] like it's real and it's the

01:06:06.04 most insane stuff I've ever heard it's weirdos and shred dies

01:06:29.12 what you know this is just terrible so [ __ ] has rice chicks god so wild

01:06:35.22 crunchy nut must be honey bunches of oats

01:06:49.01 yeah I have those that's also which what smarties milky

01:06:52.04 way I believe which one do you have which was Marty smart the chocolate and

01:06:56.21 smarties are chocolate to me and what you guys Americans call smarties we call

01:07:02.10 rockets hmm was tony the tiger the mascot for ricicles what's this betraying no

01:07:07.13 wait it says frosty's on the side yeah then why does it say bicycles on

01:07:11.09 the front well I'll be honest Eric it looks like someone's taped that on

01:07:15.22 okay yeah I don't know I've never seen that box that's a little

01:07:20.03 bit before my time that looks wrong wait was

01:07:23.13 did he get promoted from ricicles to busters.

01:07:28.18 [Laughter]

01:07:36.23 He's definitely grown he looks a lot different today than he did in 1977. I

01:07:42.00 wonder if bicycles were as great as frosty's or if he had a different

01:07:47.17 catchphrase what is happening tiger 1970

01:07:51.11 that was a kangaroo Katie the kangaroo

01:07:56.00 this like Australian frosties I had a kangaroo oh did they swap I feel unwell

01:08:03.14 I think it sounds like the kangaroo got fired they promoted tony up yeah and

01:08:09.05 then they hired rick to take over icicles so I'm reading the history they

01:08:13.03 had other characters named ammo the elephant and newt the the new within the

01:08:17.12 year the other mascots were dropped with elmo and newt never once Gracie the

01:08:21.17 front of the box they were never used tony was given a son tony junior tony as

01:08:27.12 a kid yeah tony has a kid there's a small tiger I didn't know that yeah does
