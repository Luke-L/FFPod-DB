00:00:37.11 Hello and welcome to episode 64

00:00:41.03 of the F**kFuckFacePodcast I just realized I definitely don't think we did an intro

00:00:46.11 the last one we just recorded uh so just listen to this one twice I'm Geoff Geoff

00:00:52.06 uh with me as always is Gavin Gavin and Andrew Andrew

00:00:56.13 did we not do an intro I feel like we did we started it started with you and uh

00:01:02.12 Eric fighting over nsync oh yeah top dog and sync and then yeah he said that not

00:01:06.19 around 63. Okay I think so this is 64 then uh if my math is correct

00:01:13.01 uh the principles of addition uh continue to function as uh as uh

00:01:17.09 described to me as a child uh this is episode 64 of the F**kFuckFacePodcast and uh I

00:01:22.19 don't know about you boys I still have three things left over to talk about

00:01:28.06 from my previous list that we didn't get to because of the world's longest open

00:01:33.20 water story but I don't wanna I don't wanna

00:01:35.20 monopolize the episode either no you guys wanna talk about anything go right

00:01:39.14 ahead no I mean if it's on par with the ocean rescue story I need I mean I just

00:01:45.01 need to know everything I need to know how your day is I need to have a

00:01:50.10 continuation let me tell you about today this is the portion of uh of this uh

00:01:54.05 this is called purple nightmare I I I feel like I want Andrew to guess

00:01:58.07 what this is about what what do you think purple that's a great idea I would

00:02:02.11 like you both to guess that's a great I described it as a lucid waking nightmare

00:02:08.02 a purple lucid waking nightmare I'm gonna guess that you dreamt that you

00:02:13.05 were on a boat and grimace was yelling at you to go now is my guess

00:02:18.13 I was thinking bonnie was so far off when you say purple

00:02:21.11 nightmare it was this actually a nightmare or is this an experience that

00:02:24.12 was real that you just you're just calling a nightmare it was an experience

00:02:27.17 that was so horrible it felt like a nightmare okay you were riding you were

00:02:32.23 riding your bike and you saw a lovely field of lavender to your side and you

00:02:37.13 thought oh that looks nice and then suddenly your bike just veered into it

00:02:42.05 and you rolled down a hill through lavender thus living a purple nightmare

00:02:46.12 on the way I wish I'm gonna continue off that I'm gonna

00:02:49.09 guess that Geoff was trying to do his bike trick doing a practice round

00:02:53.12 trying to get into it was listening to prince while doing so and it went

00:02:58.12 horribly wrong that is my second purple nightmare I

00:03:02.06 love the idea behind that uh it's a little more pedestrian unfortunately so

00:03:07.03 I thought I was going to have a good day today and it's it's largely been a good

00:03:11.16 day I mean I haven't even think that though I just felt like it I woke up in

00:03:15.03 a good mood and I thought like today I knew I had to go to the doctor I hadn't

00:03:18.10 been to the doctor in a while and I want to go get some blood work done and you

00:03:21.11 know just a wellness exam so I went and got a tetanus shot and because I figure

00:03:25.01 if anybody on earth needs a tetanus shot it's me and uh I mean

00:03:29.00 I put on something yeah also you know you want to check your cholesterol and

00:03:32.09 do all the stuff a man like myself has to do in his mid-40s and so I was kind

00:03:36.16 of looking forward to that because it's one of those things that you you put off

00:03:39.18 and you put off and I was glad to finally be doing it you know and so I

00:03:44.04 had to I had to leave kind of early to go to the doctors

00:03:46.19 and one thing I do uh when I have Millicent you know

00:03:50.07 with joint custody I have her half the time so on the weeks that I have

00:03:55.12 Millicent every morning or virtually every morning I make her a smoothie

00:04:00.17 she has some specific dietary requirements and uh I really I've

00:04:05.06 learned how to make this awesome smoothie that's really fun and she seems

00:04:08.21 to appreciate it and it it sets her up for uh sets her up for in the right way

00:04:13.03 uh for her day she's all full of nutrients and stuff and uh anyway so I

00:04:17.14 was making her smoothie it's a it's a blueberry it's a blueberry smoothie

00:04:21.12 it's got a lot of stuff in it but the uh the main ingredients are blueberry and

00:04:26.21 banana and peanut butter and it was the yogurt

00:04:29.11 that was that caused the initial problem and some honey and some other stuff

00:04:33.09 anyway so uh I have this like ninja food

00:04:37.01 like smoothie maker machine and it makes

00:04:38.22 like a 20 ounce smoothie and so uh I was talking to Emily this morning while she

00:04:42.22 was getting ready for work and I was making the smoothie and putting it all

00:04:46.10 together and I crammed it a little too full of

00:04:48.20 yogurt which I can't stand so when I put the lid on the way it works is you like

00:04:52.19 fill it up you put a lid on that's got the uh the little [ __ ] blades in it

00:04:57.00 then you stick it on the machine and it goes

00:05:00.13 and it spins it all up and so when I put the blade then I pushed it down it

00:05:03.22 [ __ ] shot yogurt out of all the sides which if there's one thing I like less

00:05:08.17 than yogurt it's it's goopy uh it's goopy yogurt coming out of the sides of

00:05:12.18 a smoothie thing it was like I I wretched I'm like whoa [ __ ] how's it

00:05:16.04 coming from the sides because I like like at the top where you like screw it

00:05:19.18 in oh okay there was too much volume and so it like squirts it's like yogurt

00:05:22.23 squirt coming out of the top that'd be a great way to describe it gross white

00:05:28.02 yogurt squirt and I was like so I go over uh

00:05:31.15 I go over and I rinse it off and then and so the the now the

00:05:35.12 the canister's a little slippery and wet right then I take it over to the

00:05:40.03 smoothie machine and I put it in the smoothie machine

00:05:43.16 and I get the smoothie all nice and blended and it's very purple

00:05:48.08 and then I go over back to the to the kitchen sink because

00:05:53.00 some more yogurt squirt has come out and so I take the cap off and I'm like

00:05:56.03 trying to just you know clean it up a little bit get the yogurt squirt off of

00:06:00.04 it and stuff so that it's uh not disgusting for Millie and I turn around

00:06:04.07 with it in my hand and I guess I guess it just wasn't holding it well

00:06:09.01 enough and it was wet and I throw the smoothie across the kitchen

00:06:13.05 and it hits the floor and it explodes and 20 ounces of purple smoothie

00:06:21.11 makes 20 ounces of purple smoothie can cover an entire house

00:06:27.11 it can cover all of the floor it can cover three different carpets it can cover

00:06:33.03 every kitchen cabinet it can cover uh all of the walls it can cover a lot of

00:06:39.16 ceiling you can paint a lot of ceiling with a 20-ounce purple smoothie that's

00:06:45.12 one of those I don't know where to start kind of yeah which bit do you clean

00:06:50.21 first it went so far it shot across the island of my kitchen

00:06:55.08 Gavin you know where my you've been in my house so in my kitchen it shot over

00:07:00.11 like the little cutout area on across the dining room table it covered the

00:07:06.13 windows in my living room it did like a James mcavoy bullet bend around the wall

00:07:11.15 and managed to then spin back and hit my

00:07:14.05 front door which isn't even visible from where it hit the ground

00:07:19.03 it sounds like when mr bean tried to paint his flat by putting a firework in

00:07:24.17 a can of paint and just running I didn't I didn't see that but uh

00:07:28.23 and I just like stared at it and Emily was leaving and I just went outside and

00:07:32.06 said you've got to come home you've got to come back she's like what's wrong

00:07:34.06 with wrong I'm like I don't know what to do I don't know what to do and she runs

00:07:37.22 and she's like what's wrong and I go what do I do and she just goes

00:07:42.04 I gotta go to work she was like wake up Millie she'll help

00:07:45.12 you and then she left because she had to go to work she had clients in the chair

00:07:49.09 whatever uh I know she filmed a video of it so you guys can see that at some

00:07:52.21 point but uh I I then got up Millie and for uh uh 40 minutes we cleaned purple

00:07:57.09 it was just everywhere every and every time I

00:07:59.21 thought it was done I would like move a dining room chair and realize no the

00:08:04.13 whole seat is full of purple and uh I had to clean three different rugs I had

00:08:08.15 to clean the ceiling in two rooms significantly uh we've got to get you a

00:08:13.10 security camera or something yeah inside right and then yeah and then after it

00:08:19.03 was all done and I got it all clean I walked into my bedroom and I sat down

00:08:24.08 and I just cried I cried for a good two minutes just cried and then I got up

00:08:29.07 I wiped off my tears I went back in and I made another goddamn smoothie

00:08:34.00 because Millie needed her breakfast and so I made another goddamn smoothie and

00:08:39.08 then I and I endeavored to have a better day after that there's always just like

00:08:44.10 an underlying level of tragedy to all your funny stories

00:08:47.14 oh was that today did that happen today that happened at 900 a.m today

00:08:52.11 what a start you and you thought it was gonna be a good day which means you

00:08:55.13 probably only had an hour or two of thinking it was great

00:08:59.16 as well but I was expecting the blender to have fired it out but it was just you

00:09:03.19 throwing it I [ __ ] threw it with like z like I threw it with like some force

00:09:08.17 dude I I don't even know how to describe it was it like a gronk spike like what

00:09:12.12 are we taught as far as yeah yeah kind of like a gronk spike yeah there you go

00:09:17.03 that's a good way to describe it yeah it was like Bronx I've never been more

00:09:23.12 shocked in my life I was like it was as bad Gavin and I I recognize

00:09:27.01 like there's a story from years and years and years ago where I had a my dog

00:09:32.00 had diarrhea and my Roomba ran over it and it's it shot [ __ ]

00:09:36.02 six feet up my walls right it wasn't cleaning up feces I'll say

00:09:41.00 that so that was a bonus but it was way more cleanup it got way it just like it

00:09:46.10 laughed at the Roomba [ __ ] story it was

00:09:49.06 like I can top that easy so in terms of grossness it would probably rank

00:09:53.12 a three behind the Roomba [ __ ] and the half dead cow but in terms of spread it

00:09:58.16 would probably be number one yeah it's a three behind those it's definitely easy

00:10:04.08 number one in terms of difficulty cleaning up and spread yeah it was a it

00:10:09.11 was a [ __ ]

00:10:11.09 oh oh my mail my Alexa my Alexa got covered

00:10:15.22 just a drippy purple mess all my mail is stained purple now

00:10:23.03 so then here's my next story regulation fart

00:10:28.00 so then I go to the doctor I do all that it's all fine it's great I like the

00:10:32.11 doctor who's a new doctor I love him everything come home I get some lunch

00:10:35.20 have some chili killers for learning it's delicious everything's going fine

00:10:38.19 then I have a quick little meeting a little work meeting and uh sitting at my

00:10:41.23 desk having my work meeting and uh there's about 10 minutes to go in the

00:10:46.13 work meeting and I have a just a perfectly regulation fart quiet fart so

00:10:50.10 I feel comfortable doing it I just like move my chair you know nobody hears it

00:10:54.11 because it was silent nothing feels amiss nothing weird as I said it wasn't

00:10:58.23 a I didn't have to push it wasn't a hard fart wasn't a wet fart it was just a

00:11:03.02 perfectly regulation fart so I fart don't even think anything about it

00:11:06.12 forget about it finish my business in the meeting get up to go to the bathroom

00:11:12.06 feel like oh I should I should do a poo now walk over pull down my pants

00:11:17.02 sit down realize there is a pile of [ __ ]

00:11:20.00 in my pants no there's no way how do you don't feel it

00:11:23.14 I [ __ ] my pants and like a like a little cow pie a little like like a

00:11:29.01 cow pie and I just didn't feel it I don't understand I don't understand

00:11:35.18 I don't understand and it was like it wasn't it was like oh no it wasn't like

00:11:40.21 a streak or a little bubble it was like there was weight you know it like

00:11:46.00 weighed my underwear down and I don't know how I don't know how it

00:11:50.06 happened I don't know how a regulation fart had had non-regulation results and

00:11:54.13 I don't know how I didn't discover it at all until it was way too late

00:11:59.12 so that was a quick trip that was a shower and laundry

00:12:03.17 if Geoff didn't take a [ __ ] it would still be in his pants he would have

00:12:08.23 known maybe maybe I had to check and make sure this very

00:12:12.12 chair I'm sitting in didn't have [ __ ]

00:12:15.11 it didn't it was fine the pants contained it but uh but yeah

00:12:19.04 how much time passed between regulation fought and [ __ ] discovery 10 to 11

00:12:24.12 minutes so not not enough time for it to sort of go hard

00:12:28.10 no no it was still pretty goopy oh I'm I'm honestly blown away that after the

00:12:33.22 so to date when we're recording this the

00:12:36.03 episode where Andrew rips a homer in his words at the end of the last episode

00:12:40.21 that came out yesterday I am blown away Andrew that you had no

00:12:44.01 repercussions from that way oh nothing noise I couldn't it was funny I think I

00:12:48.21 I texted it to you guys I couldn't figure out that evening I was just it

00:12:52.22 was like a home run derby in my ass all night it was just I couldn't I couldn't

00:12:58.19 stop and I was like what is going on this is a regular and then the next day

00:13:02.17 after we recorded I had a fiber one bar and then it just it was like throwing

00:13:06.20 another log in the fire like it came back and I was like oh I ate like three

00:13:10.12 of these that night that's what it was so you have five it up I was fibered up

00:13:15.12 that was that it was juicing non-regulation fonts yes goddamn dude by

00:13:19.23 the way the audience universally loves war frames congratulations

00:13:25.12 huge win for [ __ ] face zero zero negative comments re andrew's butt

00:13:32.13 I was amazed and and and it was joyous to see

00:13:36.15 I think we've got a good audience I think we've got yeah it's not it's that

00:13:41.09 like uh you know turns them off in disgust it's it's an audience full of

00:13:45.12 embrace even with such a wet disgusting penis speaking of uh speaking of

00:13:52.12 audience uh that's one of the things I wanted to talk about oh by the way I

00:13:56.05 should just say I'm not terrified because I I don't think I can trust my

00:13:59.18 farts anymore this is uncharted fart territory for me if I can't trust a

00:14:04.02 regulation fart can I ever leave the house again

00:14:07.09 yeah I mean would that be would that be a fart that you would have taken the

00:14:12.21 gamble on in an airport or something yeah wow it was a regulation fart

00:14:18.09 that's just normal bog standard regulation for it you've got to figure that out

00:14:23.18 that's going to get you yeah dude I'm not excited about it uh but anyway

00:14:28.17 speaking of the audience I was I wanted to talk about the twins I feel so bad

00:14:32.17 because we did the [ __ ] my I feel so bad that they're probably going to eat my

00:14:37.07 condiment I feel really bad about that because they want the salads you know

00:14:40.19 the twins right uh they uh the comment leavers and I'm going to say

00:14:45.01 comment receivers after this because they got a lot of love they uh they took

00:14:49.22 our four salads and they made them and then they did a

00:14:53.12 salad taste test to determine the best salad the girls yeah the girls oh

00:14:57.15 yeah I didn't know that anyone had made them yeah they made them they videotaped

00:15:01.17 a review and they put it all up on twitter they had pictures by the way

00:15:06.04 mine was no offense to you guys one was easily the most aesthetic if it wasn't

00:15:10.01 the best tasting it was easy

00:15:13.18 uh I appreciated that they acknowledged mine had great spirit I feel like that

00:15:18.14 was what I was going for in the in the dinner zimmer salad definitely not a

00:15:24.04 taste uh you oh one of the twins liked yours best and

00:15:26.22 one of the twins liked mine best I don't think anyone liked mine I think they

00:15:30.21 appreciated it yeah yeah no no the the spirit as I said I appreciated the

00:15:35.03 spirit call it for it as far as taste goes it's a disaster so were they ranked

00:15:40.00 they did yes they ranked them it's a great video I'll send it to you yes yes

00:15:44.15 I want to see it it was awesome they also they also uh set the uh waffle bomb

00:15:49.04 on fire and uh and smelled it in a video not too long ago as well

00:15:53.20 they're making better content out of our content than we are [Laughter]

00:15:58.12 I wonder if they'll make all the condiments that's what I'm saying I feel

00:16:02.04 terrible I didn't design mine with the thought anyone else would try it um I

00:16:07.11 feel bad I mean yours is also just atrocious

00:16:11.03 Gavin I feel bad about that too it's not a good like

00:16:13.12 kind of yeah it wasn't good cocktail sauce there's nothing wrong with it not

00:16:17.12 for tater tots it was a bad combo it's weird on the top I'll give you that

00:16:22.12 it's not it's hey do y'all think I could be invited

00:16:25.08 back to the slack at some point that's I'm so glad that you mentioned that Geoff

00:16:29.23 I'm so cause that's on my note I wanted to bring up the fact that so I sent uh

00:16:35.05 in the episode that came out we talked about the state songs the ranking of

00:16:40.06 those and the most picture song I posted those and then Gavin made a joke saying

00:16:45.12 Tennessee spelt 10 because Tennessee has

00:16:48.08 10 state songs and my original I thought was Gavin should be removed from this

00:16:53.01 channel for that joke that was serious which then made me realize oh my god

00:16:57.02 Geoff still isn't in the slack it's been a long time maybe we just have a one in

00:17:01.19 one out rule from this point well here's the thing you left out a

00:17:05.20 protest so I thought it would be unfair of us to then drag you back in out of

00:17:11.01 your protest so if you're out of protest we'd love to have you back

00:17:14.23 but if you're willing to come back the regulation zimmer looks freaking

00:17:18.12 delicious yeah because I make good ass salads that

00:17:21.14 looks like an a mine looks like a fruit salad that looks like too much apple in

00:17:26.08 there I know how to make a [ __ ] salad man I eat them I love them [Laughter]

00:17:31.18 Raymond's yeah dude it's a lot of different [ __ ] the blueberries

00:17:36.16 next to the meat this looks a bit weird it's not good

00:17:40.15 that's not a good salad oh nick's looks healthy you take that avocado off in nix

00:17:44.14 and it looks delicious it's a good salad I mean well if you like avocado I

00:17:48.06 understand that it would be it would be a bonus but if you don't it's a it's a

00:17:51.20 big detractor so you want back in the slack Geoff just to clarify we can add

00:17:55.08 you back we'd love to have you back I have a question though does Geoff get to

00:17:58.19 see all the stuff we wrote while he was gone I think so yeah I mean that's up to

00:18:02.10 him if he wants to scroll up I don't I don't think I do I think I think I it

00:18:05.19 starts where I joined I think I lost my progress that was a lot covered that we

00:18:09.11 should probably maybe we could just repaste it or huh yeah well maybe maybe

00:18:14.01 it wasn't for me to see

00:18:16.13 well that's uh that's everything I had on my list now it's all I'm left with is

00:18:21.12 the queries and insights which I was just gonna pepper in

00:18:24.12 uh as we uh as we went uh one of those of course was the the twins have a

00:18:29.04 question for you guys let me ask you guys a question okay when I was in

00:18:33.05 Mexico on the island there's a rule uh in Mexico it's it's in every toilet in

00:18:37.14 the in on the island they said please please don't flush toilet paper it's uh

00:18:41.15 flesh's feet as little toilet paper is possible it's an island and the plumbing

00:18:46.12 isn't great yeah so they they want you to like throw it in a waste bin um and

00:18:51.14 that got me thinking what if every person on the island flushed toilet

00:18:57.09 paper at the exact same time would it blow up

00:19:00.19 I think all the pressure would funnel to like one toilet somewhere

00:19:05.22 which got me thinking what if every toilet on earth was flushed at the

00:19:11.09 exact same time think of it like a like a global [ __ ] in everybody

00:19:17.18 poop or not but everybody flushes the toilet at the exact same time would

00:19:22.14 earth implode yeah the planet is cracking off

00:19:26.12 I mean maybe not but something has to happen right like that many

00:19:32.00 millions or billions of toilets flushing at the exact same time it would have to

00:19:37.05 have some sort of effect what would that be it would have to back up somewhere

00:19:42.00 because all this water is currently stored and it's under it's like held up by

00:19:47.16 gravity so you've got all of gravity of all of these tanks just ready to drop

00:19:52.03 water yeah Geoff interesting Geoff is describing this like the lamest project

00:19:56.12 mayhem like he doesn't he doesn't want to blow

00:19:59.01 up the financial district he just wants every toilet to flush at the same time I

00:20:03.05 just I'm curious what happened like has anybody ever done a study we should

00:20:07.16 Google it find out like you want to do like flush across america yeah like are

00:20:11.17 there any uh are there any like civil engineers out there that would have any

00:20:16.10 idea like what the ramifications would be if if every toilet on a system like

00:20:21.16 on the same treatment facility or whatever flushed like would there be

00:20:25.02 enough water to instantly return at all would it be like would it get

00:20:29.10 overwhelmed and start like like would it be like in a like in a movie when like

00:20:34.23 like when uh all the pipes start busting and like steam starts poshing me out

00:20:40.17 but it's just [ __ ] and piss everywhere the scarecrow and uh batman begins yeah

00:20:46.13 exactly exactly like that oh the lower level of the titanic but

00:20:51.09 it's just because everybody's flushed exactly

00:20:54.13 I wonder if you'd be able to see it from a plane [Laughter]

00:20:58.18 what would it look like

00:21:01.01 thought that the ground came in maybe I don't know

00:21:04.23 something like 20. What's that movie 2012 yeah

00:21:09.07 so if you're out there if you're a comet

00:21:11.23 leaver uh and you have any insights into what would happen if a million toilets

00:21:18.04 cried out at once not enough people listened to face to

00:21:21.10 actually cause an environmental disaster I'm not trying to cause one I just am

00:21:25.14 wondering what would happen I'm not recommending this I don't want

00:21:30.13 to do this I'm not espousing it as an idea that we should pursue I'm just

00:25:00.21 will be long over by the time they hear about this this will be a distant thing

00:25:04.18 the Olympics start in two days I love the Olympics like the spelling bee I had

00:25:08.23 people I tweeted out about how great that spelling bee was people were like

00:25:12.03 is this a bit not a bit smelling be a fantastic event that by the way not not

00:25:16.06 to derail your story but that was fun like I I've been waiting around for it

00:25:19.20 but you and I hung out and uh we just texted all night watching the spell and

00:25:23.22 be together and it was enthralling I had the best time watching the spelling bee

00:25:27.09 with you it's a great event people should watch it every year it's a lot of

00:25:30.13 fun even if you're not doing like ridiculous things like what my football

00:25:34.11 fantasy football league does it's just a [ __ ] awesome event to watch these

00:25:38.06 people there were there were so many intense moments I've never seen someone

00:25:43.01 like go to spell the word and then like ask for more clarifications on like

00:25:48.00 origin and whatnot it was intense the person who won almost lost it's a great

00:25:51.22 thing I was a a social event and I try not to spend too much time on my phone

00:25:56.04 when I'm around real people and I just had it down somewhere and then I picked

00:26:01.12 it up and there were like 175 new messages in the creature

00:26:05.08 it was like reading someone's live tweet from like an apple event or something

00:26:10.20 it was amazing I couldn't believe what I was missing

00:26:14.17 out on there was like moments of tension in there oh yeah there were oh

00:26:18.22 Andrew Andrew was convinced they were icing his guy out he was very upset

00:26:22.12 about it I was outraged my kid they went to

00:26:25.06 commercial break two times in a row on my kid just icing them just put some

00:26:29.12 pressure on it I feel like that was a good enough read to the point where

00:26:34.04 along the same lines as a break [ __ ]

00:26:36.17 stream we should just have like a live stream reaction or commentary to an

00:26:39.21 event that's going on like that I think it would be good yeah well well I don't

00:26:44.06 know maybe something I don't know we're going away

00:26:47.22 and stuff but so I love the Olympics fantastic event I have gambled heavily

00:26:51.18 on the Olympics this year I'm excited to celebrate it I didn't have much of a

00:26:56.06 strategy I just took the over for every country's medals that it would let me

00:27:00.03 bet on uh so I'm cheering for everybody not gold medals I just need any medals

00:27:04.08 so this is my betting list I've Canada u.s Australia Belgium china Colombia

00:27:10.00 Denmark Finland France Germany great britain japan Netherlands Norway Spain

00:27:14.09 and Sweden all over the number of medals this is number of medals earned that is

00:27:18.19 why how can you get half a medal so that's it's for setting the over

00:27:23.12 under right so by putting a 0.5 you can't win half the medal so it'll

00:27:27.02 clearly be either above or below that number okay so I'm going the over for

00:27:31.01 everything I don't know if that mathematically is even possible for all

00:27:34.22 these bets to win uh for going over but I'm excited this is gonna be my next two

00:27:39.20 weeks is watching basketball and rowing and track

00:27:43.14 just being terrified about metal placement so if two people in Finland

00:27:48.04 get bronze medals yeah I'm all about Finland I was like

00:27:52.22 1.5 for Finland that seems super low who who are you most worried about for

00:27:57.09 Finland because it's 1.5

00:27:59.09 dude I had to look they got 20 athletes in it I'm excited though but by the time

00:28:04.01 that people hear this the Olympics are going to be over like a week ago they

00:28:08.21 ended over a week at this point so they will know if uh I'm miserable I wonder

00:28:12.18 if great bitten got there 44 and a half or not hopefully it doesn't come down to

00:28:18.13 penalty kicks right Kevin that was too soon man it's too soon

00:28:22.14 that was fantastic just watching the misery and I didn't even know that was

00:28:26.21 happening I don't think we've talked about this in a regular face but if you

00:28:31.18 want to see my live reactions to england the 2020 euro final it's in our third

00:28:37.03 what's in our rtx break [ __ ] stream what's on YouTube oh

00:28:41.07 dear but the timing of that the timing of that stream unbelievable it was

00:28:46.23 fantastic yeah couldn't ask for a better setup for that

00:28:49.21 oh there's surfing in the Olympics yeah there is and skateboarding now how do

00:28:53.19 you get a gold medal at surfing what do you have to what are they scoring you on

00:28:58.08 on surfing ah I could guess but I guess it's like the

00:29:02.06 same it's the same way they surf in competitions it's like complexity of the

00:29:06.07 ride uh you know how many moves you do similar to skateboarding yeah very

00:29:10.18 similar to skateboarding okay yeah I just never I've never watched

00:29:15.14 competitive surfing I'm jazzed about the like sports that I

00:29:18.21 give a [ __ ] about being represented finally like surfing and skating that

00:29:22.05 kind of stuff obviously basketball but the usa men's basketball team sucks

00:29:27.01 apparently so we'll see yeah they barely made it in right yeah 1.5 medals for

00:29:32.08 Finland is nuts like if they get two bronzes yeah I not only is it like I

00:29:36.08 didn't put the odds on that that was like an unlikely thing to happen they

00:29:40.13 gave favorable odds that they wouldn't get two so so Andrew what are we looking

00:29:46.08 at are if let's say if you hit every one of these are you retiring not even no I

00:29:50.16 just put one unit on every bet okay so it's not a huge difference either way I

00:29:54.21 need about half of them to win to make the money back that I put down

00:29:58.20 so I feel okay about it I'm sure you will I yeah we'll see I'm just excited

00:30:03.11 to be up at 3 a.m watching some random event that I typically wouldn't care

00:30:07.03 about just yelling about metal placement it's gonna be Russian handball all over

00:30:12.04 again it will be yeah I love it it's hand bowling there handball is uh yeah

00:30:17.18 interesting it is interesting I'm excited I want to get in on this if

00:30:20.22 there's a any live discussion okay well you're going to be

00:30:24.12 that that's the second conversation I had you so you're going you're going

00:30:27.19 you're going to foreign country are you going to have to quarantine still at

00:30:31.13 this point yeah [ __ ] okay I was hoping that'd be now

00:30:36.06 cause last time you said that you're gonna be stuck for four or whatever days

00:30:41.16 and then you're just gonna play outskirts play it out yeah yeah so I

00:30:45.03 just wanted to see I wanted to if I could relax a little bit not have to

00:30:48.12 think about outskirts I think it's actually six days because [ __ ] you

00:30:52.13 technically if I if I test negative on the fifth day

00:30:55.17 uh oh I think it's like seven days because then I'll be waiting like 24

00:30:58.17 hours for the result but technically the day you land is day zero so yeah I'm

00:31:03.04 probably a week a week straight of outskirts that's awful people who are

00:31:08.04 fully vaccinated don't have to quarantine but only if they got

00:31:12.21 vaccinated in the uk I got shot with the same [ __ ]

00:31:17.07 it's annoying that is a strange thing I feel I'm still processing I was

00:31:21.20 laughing so hard the fact that Geoff or Gavin how

00:31:26.04 has your day been so far today just a normal day you [ __ ] your pants or

00:31:30.20 anything that's what I'm kind of getting at uh

00:31:33.21 pretty solid day yeah I mean I had another covered test but um that'd be

00:31:38.02 like the 70th one probably yeah I got it yes

00:31:40.22 that's pretty normal at this point yeah it's an uneventful day you and I were

00:31:44.17 just living our life Geoff had a [ __ ]

00:31:47.12 dye pack go off in his house and he built the sand castle in his shorts and

00:31:51.02 he's just here I just keep processing how wildly different our days are yeah

00:31:56.12 and uh not that like like abnormal of a day for

00:31:59.20 me either that's uh this I don't always

00:32:02.15 think to tell you all the dumb [ __ ] that happens because it's so commonplace

00:32:07.22 that's why I need I need a live feed to your life [Laughter]

00:32:13.07 we have such different like the last kitchen disaster I had was really under

00:32:18.10 I got a rice cooker like over a year ago never used it I was like ah I'm gonna I

00:32:24.06 was in a weird spot of like hungry but didn't want to make a meal this was late

00:32:28.14 so I put the rice in did everything hit start one hour appeared I was like

00:32:34.04 whatever I'll wait an hour waited an hour opened it up I was more surprised

00:32:38.05 than Morgan freeman and seven to open it

00:32:40.18 up and see the rice uncooked like it was just it looked the exact same as I put

00:32:44.17 it in what I didn't realize is it wasn't a start button it was a delay start

00:32:50.00 button so I clicked delay start for one hour

00:32:52.05 sat down there just waited and then open it like ah rice time

00:32:56.06 not even slightly cooked it then turned on after the fact I had to wait two

00:33:00.11 hours to make my cup of rice it was dreadful but it's like it's a

00:33:05.01 contained issue I don't have [ __ ] on my

00:33:07.13 walls I don't have well exploding I will say the last time we recorded you had a

00:33:12.13 that is your intense issue with a tea kettle the tea kettle ramen scenario was

00:33:16.14 was the best god I forgot about that I was looking at the pictures this morning

00:33:22.04 it was a disaster but yeah but I've learned like since then that that's like

00:33:26.04 a 200 kettle it's a fancy fancy [ __ ]

00:33:28.18 it's it's a nice kettle yeah dude you're

00:33:31.11 flexing your your kettle flex was pretty intense

00:33:35.03 was it a kettle flex it's a nice kettle yeah

00:33:38.10 yeah I was uh I just had a pretty pretty

00:33:41.11 nice day I was rendering footage earlier it was taking ages so I just I just

00:33:44.22 thought I'd quickly watch Jurassic park it's a good movie I realized I've seen

00:33:49.01 that movie I must have I saw it way more times the kid maybe like I must have

00:33:53.18 seen it like 15 times I don't think I ever realized what the movie's about or

00:33:57.17 like why the movie happens because it's always like a plot of a movie right the

00:34:03.05 main plot is you know man yeah rebirth dinosaurs and it goes against

00:34:07.22 nature nature fights back dinosaurs don't do it

00:34:10.05 the mosquito thing like the origin of it is that not even that I didn't realize

00:34:15.22 that movie happens because the guy that dies at the beginning the

00:34:20.10 guy that gets sucked into the raptor pen his family is suing the park for 20

00:34:24.14 million dollars and the investors are pulling out and john Hammond needs two

00:34:29.11 experts to sign off on the safety of the park don't think I ever paid attention

00:34:33.17 to that you could summarize movies in a way that doesn't reveal well I guess

00:34:37.16 that would kind of give it away but there's like really

00:34:40.12 ignorable plot in movies and I feel like

00:34:42.12 I want to go through all the movies I've seen a lot of times

00:34:45.11 and like write down the plot of why they actually take place I'll be honest dude

00:34:49.23 you just blew my mind yeah yeah right yeah I've seen that movie so many times

00:34:54.00 I don't either it's just like the unmemorable

00:34:56.18 crap like you're you're a kid you're watching it's like man I wish the

00:35:00.04 helicopter would land on the freaking island we see some damn dinosaurs and

00:35:03.12 you don't see any you don't really listen to any of the exposition I'm sure

00:35:07.12 uh I'm sure minor league fan jack is [ __ ] going like oh how did you not

00:35:12.01 know I can't believe it it's right there in front of you if we

00:35:15.16 call jack do you think he would know now why Jurassic park starts yes and I want

00:35:20.09 somebody else to do it because I'm not going to be responsible for piping in

00:35:24.17 jack again at the last time just tell him to go you do it I

00:35:28.21 I don't let me see if he's on discord right now I'm trying to think if and he

00:35:35.10 is yes I wouldn't know is that the most exciting legal dispute

00:35:39.12 of all time as far as genre is a movie name a more thrilling legal movie it's a

00:35:45.18 lawsuit movie Kramer versus Kramer liar liar

00:35:49.03 is liar liar thrilling that's just like funny isn't it Gary Glenn Ross

00:35:54.02 that's not a thrilling movie that is dialogue heavy there's no the

00:35:59.16 pelican brief I haven't seen it the firm Eric brockovich what is the plot of the

00:36:05.09 pelican brief [ __ ] I don't know dude I thought it was okay I was just asking I

00:36:10.00 was really hoping it was like a pelican stole a briefcase and then yes that's

00:36:13.05 what it a few good men that's a good one that's a good one nick scout my cousin

00:36:17.01 Vinnie that one an academy award excellent point nick it's a good one I

00:36:22.00 just mean I bet you Jurassic park is the only

00:36:24.04 movie that features both a law dispute like a lawsuit and dinosaurs

00:36:29.18 which I know is a very specific genre there's not a lot to go with but

00:36:35.05 you just don't there's not a crossover you anticipate

00:36:39.04 all right I'm looking I'm gonna tech I'm let me text minor league fan jack right

00:36:42.18 now oh I texted him he said in just a minute I could okay well tell him yes

00:36:47.12 then [ __ ] get his [ __ ] together Andrew I'm gonna need you to I'm gonna need

00:36:53.03 I just realized I'm gonna need an Andrew panton list of the most thrilling legal

00:36:57.22 battles in film of all time I don't have that well I don't expect

00:37:02.01 you to have it right now but but I I expected you to come back with it at

00:37:05.05 some point and then we can put it I was thinking about that we could all these

00:37:09.14 lists are perfect for the zine that's a great point

00:37:13.05 that's a great point as did I I don't I don't have that I do have I do

00:37:17.10 have a new list I do have a new ranking thing this will come out nfl preseason

00:37:23.11 just started nfl touchdown songs the definitive list I listen to all of them

00:37:28.22 it's it's I mean there's 32 teams so hail to the redacted

00:37:32.15 yeah well I mean it's that they changed their name but they're too lazy to

00:37:38.10 change their song it's very clear what it is yeah

00:37:41.11 number one the next episode which is not that's the the snoop deal [ __ ]

00:37:45.06 g song I don't feel like many people relate the title the next episode to

00:37:49.03 that song break song new Orleans saints when the saints go marching in it's a

00:37:53.01 [ __ ] talk type thing like if the running back goes it's great it's a great

00:37:57.06 combination of Seattle seahawks bias las

00:37:59.16 Vegas raiders raider nation is fine it's an ice cube song

00:38:02.23 I mean there's this it's a lot of these are generic I didn't know the

00:38:06.03 Jacksonville jaguars is an actual song but I described it as sounds like when

00:38:09.11 the power rangers form into a big robot to kick ass that's the vibe you get from

00:38:14.15 it I think it's called bro him though upon further research it was that the

00:38:20.12 Miami dolphins is a wild one uh they used their fight song which they

00:38:24.00 made in like the 70s and they just lie to their fans every time they score it's

00:38:28.12 like Miami dolphins are number one they always think about winning a super bowl

00:38:31.15 they're the best team that's ever existed I struggled to find a thing that the

00:38:37.01 dolphins were number one at just in any way Annie

00:38:40.16 I lost Andrew I lost Andrew too I thought I thought I lost me and I was

00:38:45.07 about to do that because I just I was explaining to them

00:38:48.00 before you got on I had my internet fixed yesterday and the guy it took

00:38:51.01 about three and a half hours and I'm reasonably certain that nothing improved

00:38:55.03 ah wait so I've been you know I lose myself for

00:38:58.10 about a minute at a time sometimes but it hasn't happened today also uh Andrew

00:39:03.07 just told me something while he's gone I'm gonna cover for him Jacksonville

00:39:06.19 jaguars song number eight uh bro him when he said that I recognized that song

00:39:11.18 that's a song by a punk band called penny wise a socal band

00:39:15.18 no it's a song like I'm assuming the jaguars are using the actual pink rock

00:39:20.23 song bro yeah hey I'm back where did I get where when

00:39:24.08 did I disconnect what happened because the dolphins but dude you said bro him

00:39:29.18 so like yes the punk rock song bro him by the band penny wise that's a great

00:39:33.23 song it is but the Detroit lion song I would recommend is fantastic if you're

00:39:39.01 gonna listen to one touchdown song listen to the Detroit lions touchdown

00:39:43.08 song it is wonderful it sounds like the band was like in the arena and they're

00:39:48.08 watching the game and they missed the touchdown and the only guy on alert was

00:39:53.19 the horn guy because it's just like and then a pause and then a second one

00:39:58.15 and then a third one and then a band kicks in with like three seconds left

00:40:03.14 into the song so it's just like imagining the horn guy just yelling like

00:40:08.05 my god please get to the drums somebody do something I can't hold this myself

00:40:13.19 and then like the music comes in at the last second it's great

00:40:18.12 it's a shitty yeah exactly it sucks as a song but just the context or the vibe

00:40:23.16 that it gives you is why it rakes so high it is really dumb it's a fantastic

00:40:28.11 song I read that um there's a lot of la sports teams across multiple sports who

00:40:33.05 always play I love la by randy Newman at sporting events

00:40:36.19 but but that song's about how much I.a sucks isn't it isn't that a song that's

00:40:42.15 like this like all this [ __ ] stuff that's in I.a it's like an ironic song I

00:40:47.18 feel like maybe they don't understand it uh yeah I can't believe you ranked

00:40:51.21 prince's let's go crazy as number 30.

00:40:54.06 Well because it's like the way it's mixed you gotta understand that these

00:40:57.14 are these aren't just the songs it sounded like I couldn't tell what it was

00:41:00.23 initially I thought wait a second are the vikings doing the duck tales theme is

00:41:04.05 their touchdown song because that would be quite the move and it's let's go

00:41:07.23 crazy by prince that's not a judgment of the song it's how it's used for the

00:41:12.00 touch now makes sense thank you for the clarification song in an ea sports game

00:41:15.22 that you've never heard outside yeah and if you hear that that's exactly

00:41:20.17 if you played ea sports games you would get that vibe as well what's fascinating

00:41:25.10 is green bay the colts and the bengals all have the same touchdown song which

00:41:30.12 is that um I don't want to go to work I just want to bang on my drum all day

00:41:35.03 that's their touchdown song is that why you've written drum banging original

00:41:40.04 asterisk yes so so what you listen to it and the first two I heard it was the

00:41:44.03 bengals and the packers and they just have an instrumental track of it they

00:41:48.05 don't have any lyrics the cults have like a horn at the beginning they

00:41:52.14 include the lyrics and they remix it a little bit so it became a question of

00:41:56.09 who used it first was it the colts and then the other two swooped in because I

00:41:59.19 think teams somewhat frequently changed their touchdown song it's not something

00:42:03.14 that a lot of teams necessarily are married to but it's as I guessed the

00:42:07.09 colts it's like when you try to copy your friend's homework and you just make

00:42:11.12 the minimal amount of changes so it's not recognizable they stole the packers

00:42:15.18 song in like 2014 which was that and they just slightly edited it so it'd be

00:42:20.07 a little bit unique but it's just the song it's a lot of history the Miami

00:42:24.13 dolphins fight song just sort of like random tangent the guy that wrote it got

00:42:28.06 like no credit for it and he's now a defense attorney in Tennessee and he

00:42:33.03 is the creator of one of the most iconic like he got

00:42:36.22 his band together they recorded it sent a bunch of demos out in Miami waited a

00:42:41.01 few months he called his friend like hey have you heard a song called Miami

00:42:44.13 dolphins number one and his friend was like if I hear that song one more

00:42:49.03 time I'm gonna kill somebody he had no idea that the song was getting a play it

00:42:52.23 was the biggest song in Miami and he just had no clue nobody would believe

00:42:56.17 that he wrote the song it was so iconic like he told his friend annoying I wrote

00:43:00.12 that and his friend was like you're full of [ __ ] there's no way because you're

00:43:04.17 just a random musician in the middle of la there's no way you

00:43:07.17 created the Miami dolphins iconic song so we had to fly to Miami and buy a

00:43:12.03 record of it to show proof that this is my name I made this song the dolphins

00:43:16.23 wouldn't do [ __ ] for them they refused to pay for it they're like we're just

00:43:21.03 gonna continue to use it we're not even

00:43:23.20 gonna recognize you so he said [ __ I you Miami and he went to Houston and he

00:43:27.13 re-recorded the same song and tried to sell it to the Houston oilers which is

00:43:31.09 now a defunct franchise and it sounds slightly different and you

00:43:35.01 think like oh he did it because he wanted a musical change what happened

00:43:39.01 was he hired a bunch of musicians who all showed up stoned and they brought

00:43:43.18 the wrong instruments so it just like made do with what they had so there's a

00:43:46.22 random horn in it because the guy brought a porn for some reason it's

00:43:50.12 absurd it's absurd time but he was able to sell it to the oilers but then they

00:43:54.15 died so all he's made is like a thousand five hundred dollars from this song all

00:43:58.23 he got from Miami was two game tickets he got free tickets to a game in the 90s

00:44:05.03 that's all the compensation nobody knows who he is but he wrote one of the most

00:44:09.02 iconic football songs that is played every time Miami squares at home since

00:44:13.13 like the 70s what's this person's name yeah that's the thing I don't remember

00:44:18.11 it's the least memorable name of all time

00:44:21.02 I forgot all this effort it's like this guy deserves the recognition he doesn't

00:44:25.13 remember in his name though no I've read like four stories on the guy

00:44:29.23 I've tried I can't remember his name it's the opposite of the basket weaver

00:44:33.16 whose name you knew but you didn't know anything else about I know everything

00:44:39.11 about him but his name well you want to guess it uh it's uh e

00:44:45.07 I feel like it might be Igor we're gonna go with an Igor Igor

00:44:52.13 Patterson Igor Patterson guess a writer much more insulting

00:44:56.17 considering we live in a time where you could find out in one second online

00:45:01.20 faster than it took you to make up a name probably probably I I will say uh

00:45:06.17 by the way you're describing life continually kicking this guy in the dick

00:45:11.05 I feel like I'd get along really well with him he sounds like a real Geoff yeah

00:45:16.21 lee off man is his name eagle I was close Igor Patterson lee off man

00:45:21.17 almost the same amount of letters in the

00:45:23.20 first name lee is a short name Igor only four I feel like I was relatively close

00:45:29.12 I remembered it was a short name eagle Igor

00:45:34.04 that's the same as be like oh what was this now I think um Frankenstein I think

00:45:39.13 oh jim [ __ ] I was close to that no those

00:45:43.03 are the letter count those names are way off I was only one letter off

00:45:46.18 one two syllables versus one though that's true that's a good point if I

00:45:50.16 would have got the syllable count that would have been an icing or a cherry not

00:45:54.09 an icing you always have icing on the cake it's the cherry on the top of the

00:45:59.14 sundae what I see on the cake is also a phrase yeah yeah but like

00:46:02.23 well I guess there are icing less cakes now right aren't they called naked

00:46:06.19 they're all they're always have been well I mean like I feel like they're more

00:46:11.18 popular than they used to be this technology has moved on the icing has

00:46:15.15 retreated from the cakes it has well there's naked cakes now and there's

00:46:19.14 still icing on them I guess but it's like the side or is there icing on a

00:46:24.13 naked cake I'm not crazy you know what I'm talking

00:46:28.10 about like it's in the middle layers but it's not on the sides

00:46:31.18 I've made one I made one years ago yeah well like the top and in the middle if

00:46:36.02 you're doing a layered cake yeah I just feel like if it's on the sides it's

00:46:40.10 definitely on the top as well it's not like

00:46:43.05 nobody makes a cake like friday's head.

00:46:54.02 I want a fruit cupcake honestly I don't even [ __ ] out of that I

00:46:59.03 feel like the ratio of icing to sponge would be great

00:47:03.16 I'm not I'm not a big icing guy I'm a big icing guy I want I'll tell you what

00:47:09.04 you can have the fryer tuck I'll just have the icing that you shave off the

00:47:12.19 top of his head what's the whole point it comes without

00:47:15.19 the neat you'd have to just eat the back

00:47:18.10 of his head that's right the back of his head

00:47:20.14 I'll eat his face I just want the back of fryer tuck's head that's all I want

00:47:25.16 you can have the face Larry David kick [Laughter]

00:47:32.19 oh [ __ ] oh my gosh so jack's still not showing up maybe he's

00:47:37.12 doing his normal level of face attendance hustle yeah it's a standard

00:47:42.19 face hustle I uh well if this is the case then I assume if it's gonna go sop

00:47:47.08 with him then I'll probably be getting hit up in a couple of seconds to leave

00:47:51.20 this podcast to go work on annual pass for a few minutes [Laughter]

00:47:56.11 when's our next break [ __ ] uh I was asking Eric that this morning I would

00:48:00.00 like to know because I would like to start planning for early august is what

00:48:04.05 I requested so hopefully somewhere in there but sometime in august for sure

00:48:07.20 all right I I don't know if it'll be when you're in town or not Gavin but

00:48:10.21 I'll try to I'll try to schedule it so that you're around well maybe um Andrew

00:48:14.21 could be there in person and I'll be in the tv oh well we could do that well I

00:48:18.23 mean we need to give Andrew a a couple weeks notice to start the trip

00:48:24.04 it's true it's not a fast trip for Andrew go now go go go go now

00:48:29.20 go let's go now just jumps onto a ferry oh

00:48:33.18 I'm trying to figure out what I want the ta like I I'm not decide if I just

00:48:38.07 wanted to say go go now or if it should say go go now and then have a boat stick

00:48:43.20 in half out of the water I think it's definitely hello hello

00:48:48.15 hey minor league fan jack welcome to the podcast oh thank you so much for having

00:48:54.14 me it's it's a it's an honor to be here it's nice to have you through discord

00:48:58.19 and not through Geoff's phone through his mic again

00:49:01.01 I swear to god I was actually there you couldn't hear me I don't know what was

00:49:04.04 going on but I was there yeah I heard it later in the recording jack quick

00:49:07.14 question for you shoot uh what's Jurassic park about Jurassic park is a

00:49:12.19 movie about a scientist who creates dinosaurs and then

00:49:16.12 a gentleman who turns them into a theme park based around those dinosaurs yep

00:49:20.05 okay but but why does it why why does this what's the point of the movie

00:49:23.20 what's the plot of the movie like what why I mean yeah I would argue the point

00:49:28.13 of the movie is that uh don't mess with nature and nature finds a way and uh

00:49:32.21 yeah and the the plot of the movie is uh the everything looks good but no nature

00:49:37.11 found a way and they replicated and then destroyed everything but why does the

00:49:41.08 movie happen when it happens uh can you rephrase that question please what's the

00:49:45.08 exciting incident for things to go wrong

00:49:47.13 what causes the events of the movie uh a uh nedry the hacker it shuts down the

00:49:52.10 power and because of that the the the walls go down and the dinosaurs get out

00:49:57.01 and start eating people why is the characters there

00:50:00.12 Alan grant and Ellie slater and our excuse Ellie sattler and ian Malcolm are

00:50:04.12 there to basically give their thumbs up of approval on it because the lawyers

00:50:08.12 were pissed off because people had died and so Hammond needed someone to

00:50:12.04 basically kind of give a thumbs up on the the whole park to be like oh it's

00:50:15.05 safe and it's great and so he brought them in because he was funding their dig

00:50:19.17 in Wyoming I believe or Montana and so he's like I know them and I can fund

00:50:22.19 your dick for further if you come give me a thumbs up and that's why they were

00:50:26.21 there holy [ __ ] Geoffy he knew more than

00:50:29.18 you did Gavin holy [ __ ] yep and I feel like it's Gavin's fault for how he

00:50:33.11 phrased the que he phrased it horribly like six times in a row well that was

00:50:35.05 like I didn't want to give two I didn't want to like get I don't want to give

00:50:38.23 anything away and like the information we were after I was hoping that it would

00:50:42.19 just eventually get there but there's a specific there's a line between not

00:50:46.10 giving it away and actually asking what you're asking you asked like six

00:50:50.10 different questions that were unrelated I was just trying to get closer and

00:50:55.03 closer to the reason Gavin watched Jurassic park today and he

00:50:58.05 discovered that the movie was about something he never realized and he was

00:51:01.23 explaining to us about the 20 million lawsuit over the guy that got sucked up

00:51:06.00 by the raptors and how uh they brought ian and the others on to to basically

00:51:10.16 certify that it was safe and I said if anybody on earth knows that it's you I

00:51:14.15 was just blown away check that I'd seen that movie about 15 times but I never

00:51:19.12 really knew that was the reason the the movie

00:51:21.15 events start yeah yeah it's that's the whole the whole point of it is gennaro

00:51:24.23 the the lawyer is there and he's like we gotta get people to sign off on it and

00:51:29.01 uh yeah there you go I bet there are very few people on earth who remember

00:51:34.13 that the lawyer's name is janeiro you are in the top point

00:51:37.13 zero one percent of Jurassic park fans probably oh I think I'm a Jurassic park

00:51:41.23 super fan too I guess all right okay uh uh Robert what's his name muldoon Robert

00:51:47.12 muldoon yeah he's the other the warden the game

00:51:50.04 where did john Hammond find him oh was it in a like an African safari I think

00:51:54.14 is where he found him it was it was from hammond's park in Kenya damn he knows

00:51:59.05 his [ __ ] jack who wrote the Miami dolphins fight song

00:52:03.18 the same guy who wrote the uh country road song oh that's great john Denver he

00:52:09.03 nailed it if you would have known that jack I

00:52:11.22 would have left that you would have blown my mind nobody knows his name I

00:52:14.21 don't even know his name I've read six stories about the guy I can't remember

00:52:18.02 his name's Igor Patterson right that's what we just

00:52:20.20 remember that I don't even remember we just said his name I don't remember what

00:52:24.15 it is I just remember Igor all right thanks for uh thanks for proving Geoff

00:52:28.07 wright and uh thanks for blowing my mind all right yeah I appreciate it jack

00:52:32.00 thanks big fan of the show you guys love you guys thanks jack thank you that was

00:52:36.08 a minor league fan jack he didn't he didn't leave no he's still

00:52:39.17 he's just he's here he's hanging out did he leave on his end did he just

00:52:44.17 close the app because he was on his phone I think he missed closed the app

00:52:48.06 but if he just walked away from it that is still there maybe he just wanted

00:52:52.23 I wasn't everybody just need me to leave now

00:52:57.20 okay love you bye bye I wonder if whenever he's done talking

00:53:02.12 on the phone he's like all right mom I'll see you later and he just puts his

00:53:07.11 phone down fully on and just goes to another room walks away

00:53:11.14 check really knows his [ __ ] with that movie yeah he does hey Henry found the

00:53:15.21 squeaky toy again that's cool I forgot about Henry the squeaky toy Geoff you

00:53:19.21 were trying to shush it but in your ocean rescue story it was really it

00:53:24.02 added a lot to it it was fantastic it was so funny

00:53:28.00 it was just distracting me I was trying so hard not to forget the different

00:53:33.11 elements of the story nick says that was the cherry on top

00:53:37.18 Andrew was the icing on the cherry [Laughter]

00:53:41.12 oh man by the way uh my girlfriend the other night she gave me she asked me

00:53:46.10 about something and she gave me the look

00:53:49.11 and it was uh she didn't have she didn't

00:53:52.19 say anything but with her eyes uh I very clearly got

00:53:56.23 the message to get these [ __ ] bats out of our house

00:54:00.23 oh okay so I gotta do something about these god damn bats I asked yesterday or

00:54:05.06 the other day to get more tags because we we determined the last time we

00:54:08.17 recorded that we have elements of a lot of ideas but not enough to do any one of

00:54:12.17 them so hopefully those will come in soon and then uh

00:54:16.13 Gavin will come over and cut 100 bats while I watch

00:54:20.06 so just to recap you have 100 bats and 900 knobs

00:54:24.07 correct and a thousand metal tags.

00:54:27.05 I like I just still love that someone just bought everything in our discussion

00:54:32.10 didn't like yeah worry about what we'd settled on it was like well they talked

00:54:35.18 about this they talked about this they suggested this I'll just buy all of that

00:54:39.07 now I've got everything in their defense I mean I'm I've been so confused for so

00:54:43.11 long I don't know that I gave any kind of correct instructions on what we

00:54:47.01 wanted because I don't remember I'm so [ __ ] far gone with these bats man I

00:54:50.22 just want them out of my life they haven't even started yet I like

00:54:54.12 that they [ __ ] with you more by doing what was said than Gavin and I ever did

00:54:59.12 by implying the bats were manipulated some way they've caused way more

00:55:03.12 yeah just annoyance yeah this is really yeah yeah I'm looking at them right now

00:55:09.06 they've become a permanent shelf in my library

00:55:13.02 for me to store stuff on this is we're probably not going to record for a bit

00:55:16.11 at this point I mean I don't know the break [ __ ] thing will happen but we're

00:55:20.00 probably at least two weeks I'd assume I'm gonna miss you guys I'm gonna miss

00:55:23.05 you too yeah I think we just need to stay in touch um

00:55:25.18 gonna be a lot of excitement for when we come back it's multiple layers of like

00:55:30.10 we need to stay in touch because I love you guys but also just to make sure Geoff

00:55:34.21 is still alive yeah I feel like it goes back and forth

00:55:39.04 between Andrew and Geoff on like who's more in danger because sometimes there

00:55:42.17 have been times where Andrew is just like dropping pints of blood out of his

00:55:46.09 ass and I'm actually worried that he's gonna die and now at the moment it's

00:55:49.10 just on Geoff's way so it's very different though because I feel like

00:55:53.09 Geoff's danger comes when he's going to look at sharks mine is I ordered pancake

00:55:57.09 mix and then just everything fell apart it's the mundane that gets me I look I

00:56:03.00 just got my tetanus shot so I'm feeling pretty safe right now

00:56:07.05 you're gonna be climbing over so many fences not worrying about it [Laughter]

00:56:11.22 Andrew I think we need to start booking in the dates for when you're gonna try

00:56:15.08 the marathon though I feel like it's never good when a bit is discussed and

00:56:19.19 never happens but we should not try and make it happen

00:56:22.22 I completely agree this is the redemption year it's gonna happen

00:56:26.12 yeah I've been very vocal on this actually when did the redemption start

00:56:30.00 20 is that just the beginning of the year that was it no it started when this

00:56:34.06 podcast turned two years old whatever that was so episode what 505354. Well

00:56:38.13 that'd be one year when did I do sure yeah

00:56:40.23 well yeah we're going into our second year though yeah yeah we're in the first

00:56:45.16 the first year yeah we're going into the second year year two years

00:56:50.08 year two is like redemption island it is yeah sure why not okay man I just

00:56:55.14 started season 35 of survivor and talk about the dumbest premise yet

00:57:00.21 what is that premise heroes versus healers versus hustlers it's a great

00:57:05.16 season it's a good season so far but what a dumb concept heroes versus

00:57:11.03 healers versus hustlers what they really they do run out of premises

00:57:18.23 pretty quickly god damn they eventually just start

00:57:22.18 calling it island names like like Gavin said redemption island like they move

00:57:26.06 away from like the group premises that are just like this is an island about

00:57:30.19 redemption we're gonna call this island ghost island or what is it uh uh like

00:57:36.21 when they uh when they like when they ban them to the island by themselves

00:57:41.11 exile island exactly yeah you got exile they're later there's

00:57:45.20 a later season called island of the idols and so

00:57:49.12 people are like oh [ __ ] are there like a

00:57:51.19 million idols on this island they go one

00:57:53.16 at a time like somebody has to go to the island of the idols it's not it's not

00:57:57.16 idols they just got Boston rob and Sandra hanging out on a different beach

00:58:01.23 and they're like how's it going in your game and then they give them tips and

00:58:07.05 they offer them challenges no they're not playing they just co-exist on a

00:58:12.02 different island quest givers yeah they're the eyes they did that last npc's

00:58:16.01 like Cochran was hanging out on a boat giving advice yeah that was that's a

00:58:20.00 random reward where Cochran shows up and is like what's in it for them though

00:58:23.08 like those people like Boston money good because he's trying to win money oh for

00:58:27.18 the players so okay this is how it works it is great so you get there right and

00:58:32.12 rob will be like there's one the first one I remember Boston rob is like I'm

00:58:36.04 really good at making fire do you know how to make fire I'm gonna teach you how

00:58:40.06 to make fire and then so they go through the process of teaching the person and

00:58:45.01 then they'll offer them a challenge so Boston rob was like I'll give you I

00:58:48.20 don't know a second vote at a tribal council if you can make fire faster than

00:58:53.12 me but if you can't then you lose your vote at the next tribal and then they're

00:58:57.19 like going back and forth and rob is like you know it's a big move having two

00:59:01.12 votes it could be a real game-changer you gotta evaluate your thing he

00:59:04.20 eventually convinces the person to do it they lose miserably and then it just

00:59:09.06 goes to a confessional of him going like they're the dumbest person alive why

00:59:12.22 would they challenge me they didn't know

00:59:14.20 how to make fire I taught them how would they ever beat me at this it's a really

00:59:19.08 dumb premise they have them hiding Gavin in a little spy shack at tribal council

00:59:24.00 they sit above it and do commentary of what's happening terrible season Matt

00:59:28.12 after Geoff called you Russell hance I went on a bit of a Russell hance uh tour

00:59:32.21 through this one of the most insulting things that anyone's ever said

00:59:36.12 boy is that himself and also boy does that guy's game not work if anyone has

00:59:42.08 seen him play Jesus it's a thrill he was so lucky doing

00:59:46.08 back-to-backs he was he went on survivor Australia first one voted out did not

00:59:51.07 last long that's true just immediately gone something I was looking at there is

00:59:54.17 like I guess they do like two at a time sometimes on survivor yeah does that

00:59:58.19 mean that Russell was sat there in the final well this is

01:00:03.01 the spoiler for survivor it is Russell was set there in the final of survivor

01:00:08.12 knowing that he'd already gone out again and got to the final of the other one

01:00:12.07 but had to do that entire season talking about his previous season not knowing

01:00:16.04 whether he'd won it or not yeah you blew my mind because I knew this going in

01:00:19.14 that the whole thing they talk about constantly in heroes versus villains

01:00:23.11 which is the second season that none of them had the chance to see him play and

01:00:26.21 he was kind of this unknown variable which is largely why I think he has

01:00:30.15 success in that game uh it never occurred to me that he would

01:00:34.06 have done both been in the finale for both expecting to win two million

01:00:38.12 dollars like you pointed out and win zero he didn't make a dime from playing

01:00:43.07 survivor and I watched the one where he cried

01:00:47.01 that's redemption island and then we got

01:00:50.12 stuck with his nephew for two seasons oh I haven't got to that yet

01:00:55.03 you guys are watching this show like you're popping in and out season to

01:00:58.07 season I've watched it live every season

01:01:01.03 since it came out I had to deal with the hans family for like five years yeah

01:01:06.22 five consecutive years of hand it's a long clip it's so long they really they

01:01:12.06 they try to get the most out of out of the hands fam yeah we probably shouldn't

01:01:15.22 talk about survivor too much on this because there's so many people haven't

01:01:19.13 seen it but I would love like an offline survivor conversation at one point I'm

01:01:24.13 so into it I want to do like a survivor fan podcast kind of like rose buddies

01:01:28.18 for bachelor I've been been trying to promote that or trying to throw that

01:01:31.21 idea towards Trevor for a while I don't know if we'll ever get to do that I

01:01:35.01 don't know if there'd be any audience for it but if you're a comment leaver

01:01:38.15 and you want to listen to us talk about survivor let us know maybe we'll make a

01:01:42.08 survivor podcast Andrew would have to be in it because he's like the world's

01:01:46.04 survivor authority it's bizarre to me because I'm

01:01:47.09 one of the things the pandemic people started watching survivor for some

01:01:51.14 reason maybe because it was added to Netflix

01:01:53.13 was an entry point but I've lived most of my life not being able to talk to

01:01:57.18 anybody about survivor and just watching it constantly it's maybe my favorite

01:02:01.12 show I love survivor it's a staple of my life as far as entertainment goes dude

01:02:06.15 it's all I've watched for the last 15

01:02:09.14 seasons like the last six weeks that and housewives you know the real housewives

01:02:12.19 of Beverly hills obviously the other thing Gavin did that blew my mind is he

01:02:16.03 had watched like five or six seasons he somehow hadn't seen Boston rob play Geoff

01:02:21.03 and he's like yeah he's like what season is Boston rob

01:02:24.18 on and I'm like season five season nine season 20 season 22. Like he's in six or

01:02:30.21 seven seasons yeah it's amazing that you were avoided somehow a Boston rob sees

01:02:36.02 that'd be hard to do what am I on now I'm on one where

01:02:40.05 ah it's dude he's so half-assed my birthday cameo that's great

01:02:45.03 yeah do you still have this so good yeah I think so I have the I have him in

01:02:51.05 coach coaches was like an hour that checks out can you get Probst oh

01:02:56.10 I would recommend in a not serious way Boston robb wrote one of the worst

01:03:01.22 self-help books I've ever read I haven't

01:03:05.20 read many but it's an atrocious book and uh bad advice it's not bad it's every

01:03:10.12 chapter is about three pages long and then he does a summary at the end of

01:03:14.10 every chapter where it's like three statements that cover all of it and it's

01:03:19.07 the same structure of like real statement joke statement heartfelt

01:03:24.00 statement for everything and it's just it's unnecessary it's called the Boston

01:03:27.14 rob rule book uh it's available anywhere

01:03:30.08 online like you can get it you can apple store whatever you can buy it digitally

01:03:34.17 I think he'd be a great guest for this if we ever did it oh I'd love it

01:03:38.12 he's a fascinating guy for sure it's interesting it's also interesting how

01:03:42.16 personally people take that game there are people from his seasons that have

01:03:47.14 not forgiven him for how he played [Laughter]

01:03:53.03 I I this seas survivors taught me that like if you win something you just

01:03:58.05 shouldn't do it again like there's what's this guy what's this guy's name

01:04:02.15 jt or something who apparently won once but I've only seen him just completely

01:04:07.16 not understand how to use idols like he gave one to Russell and then he went

01:04:12.20 home with another one it's like this guy should never have come back I

01:04:16.17 can't believe yeah like Sandra won twice right she did but she like plays a game

01:04:20.23 where like she gets there by the end because nobody views her as a threat

01:04:25.22 she's like a quiet Philip yeah yeah and her strategy it's the most so jt has a

01:04:31.03 phenomenal seasons I'd recommend watching uh token teams um whatever I

01:04:36.08 think that's like season probably 18

01:04:38.23 would be my guess he becomes most iconic for later and my my favorite later jt

01:04:43.11 moment and of all the seasons he gets into a fight with somebody over sugar

01:04:46.20 they won like a coffee set at a reward and he's like she keeps eating all the

01:04:51.07 [ __ ] sugar I'm sick of this person and their sugar consumption it was the

01:04:54.22 Michaela I think yeah yeah Michaela was clearly like joking around when she was

01:04:59.22 like oh seven drops of coffee and a spoonful of sugar

01:05:02.17 having a good time jt is furious so then Sandra just ate all of the sugar in the

01:05:07.12 dish and then did like the gym from the office face knowing that jt would see it

01:05:12.17 and be like Michaela ate the [ __ ]

01:05:15.05 sugar it's such a totally totally worked sue

01:05:18.19 perfect pull focus to Sandra who just nails the lens it's like quite unlike

01:05:23.19 most shots of survivor but they clearly left it in because it was like the

01:05:28.02 cameraman must have been like oh my god that was

01:05:30.08 good yeah oh my god what do you think the best season of survivor is that's

01:05:35.05 such a that's a long question we should wrap up

01:05:37.16 I guess it really depends on what you're looking for so like there's sort of an

01:05:40.22 arc I recommend that you started at the beginning of the Russell season because

01:05:44.00 that Russell whether you like him or not changed the game dramatically I love I

01:05:49.06 loved him highly entertaining to watch wasn't in game changes though uh no but

01:05:53.16 like I just argued that 80 percent of that cast wasn't a game changer it's a

01:05:58.05 terrible it's a really weird cast that was a good season though I know I don't

01:06:03.09 know spoilers I'm still on that one I just finished it two days ago okay

01:06:06.16 game changer that is uh who's like is Zeke on that season and Andrea Zeke is

01:06:11.19 on it Andrea aubry's on it uh game change is like Haley

01:06:18.13 ty is on it sierra is on it oh it's both sierras have you seen

01:06:23.22 beauty brains LeBron yeah that's a great the the thing with Scott pollard and ty

01:06:29.18 what a vote oh with a super idol you know the super idol where he's like

01:06:34.17 you're gonna give it to me and ty's just like nah scott's like really he's like

01:06:40.15 yup oh my god sir did so Gavin you said you're you're

01:06:43.23 on that season right now so you have you seen where saree

01:06:47.04 have you seen the the the vote with saree where she tries to use the idol or

01:06:51.11 stress the advantage seems like a spoiler yeah well I won't not really I just

01:06:56.16 won't spoil it for you but it's a iconic moment in survivor we should wrap this

01:07:01.07 up yeah we should wrap this up and then uh probably pitch some sort of survivor

01:07:04.22 podcast so we can just make that yeah all right well uh well this is us

01:07:09.22 stopping sorry if you don't watch survivor that was probably

01:07:13.22 insanely boring lost evidence yeah uh you should try it if you haven't try it

01:07:19.18 it's on Netflix if you're in the us it's on amazon I only started watching it

01:07:24.12 because you all talked about it and then

01:07:26.21 I was born I don't know how do you watch it outside of the us

01:07:29.13 that's a great question it's on no I watch it I watch it across Netflix hulu

01:07:34.00 and paramount plus so if any of those are available outside the us yeah but

01:07:36.22 all of those have like different libraries sure sure I don't know what

01:07:40.16 apparently like yeah paramount plus is available in Canada paramount plus has

01:07:44.02 all the seasons it's the only service that has everything okay that I'm aware

01:07:48.23 of that's a real piece of [ __ ] there I'm

01:07:50.16 not a huge fan yeah so far I can't wait to get you guys into the challenge after

01:07:55.17 survivor that that's going to be um I'm I'm ready to go buddy so I got like uh

01:08:00.12 what five more seasons of survivor that should take me another two weeks and

01:08:04.10 then I'm it's sad I've realized there's not enough time left in my life to watch

01:08:07.21 all of the television that I want to yeah yeah like there's too much reality

01:08:12.04 tv that's been made and I don't have enough time left on earth to get through

01:08:16.00 it I think I'm I think I'm not for the first time since they came out I think

01:08:21.00 I'm going to skip this season's love island I just haven't

01:08:24.07 haven't had the time to jump into it and I'm getting way far behind so I think

01:08:27.23 I'm just I might be off the love island train because there's just no time great

01:08:31.15 time to start the challenge I think it starts next week new season well I have

01:08:36.08 to watch 25 seasons to catch up that is true because unlike survivor the

01:08:40.21 challenge uses the same cast every season so it's great just dumb

01:08:44.23 dumb trashy people trying to be political and I have not seen that show

01:08:48.16 but I have seen x on the beach and I'm sure I think a lot of them are from that

01:08:52.05 show yeah it'll be interesting yeah all right well uh we still seem to be

01:08:57.01 talking uh though we all agreed to stop a while ago uh

01:09:01.03 nick is now is now posting the discord as Eric [Laughter]
