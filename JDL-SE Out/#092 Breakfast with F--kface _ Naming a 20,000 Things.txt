00:00:33.01 Dude I [ __ ] the second king's Orlando magic I don't get it what about the

00:00:38.11 coyotes the coyotes are moving to a stadium that seats 3000 people no

00:00:43.09 are you serious yes because they got kicked they forgot to pay rent on their

00:00:48.06 current stadium and then they paid it they're like oh it

00:00:51.03 was a mistake we just forgot they're like no you [ __ ] for how this works

00:00:54.13 you guys just decided not to pay it [ __ ]

00:00:56.12 you we're kicking you out even though we built this arena specifically for you

00:01:00.17 we're not gonna let you lease here again so they needed to panic make an arena

00:01:04.21 and the only arena in the area that they could go to is a college arena and

00:01:09.12 they'd have to like readjust it so they'd remove its 5000 seats currently

00:01:14.05 and they've removed 2000 seats to make it nhl like ready yeah so they'll spend

00:01:20.00 the next three years in a 3000 seat arena that's insane their arena in like

00:01:25.03 I've been to that arena like you know been like in

00:01:29.05 that area like where that arena is it's huge it's really nice everything's like

00:01:33.12 built up around it and everything why would they stop why that's insane

00:01:37.21 they're terrible what uh what's gonna happen to the nice arena uh they said

00:01:41.07 they're just gonna try to pivot away and find other things to book through it I

00:01:44.11 don't know if that means musical events or whatever you know you know change it

00:01:48.08 to concerts and stuff like that yeah it's built in the middle like they built

00:01:51.21 all like this dining and shopping and everything around it's like in the

00:01:55.03 middle of like you know it's like the way that every arena is now where like

00:01:58.15 there's just [ __ ] around it you know what they should do they should turn it

00:02:02.21 into the world's largest Starbucks it would be packed all the time

00:02:06.09 we should uh we should just see if we can get the naming rights to the thing

00:02:09.19 that isn't for the coyotes anymore oh yeah why Starbucks uh because I've

00:02:14.19 never been to a Starbucks that doesn't have a line of 400 cars in front of it

00:02:18.06 clearly there's demand you got to go to bookstores I like a

00:02:21.17 star nobody well I mean don't get me wrong I love books but I don't think

00:02:25.05 you're going to fill an arena with book fans

00:02:27.08 no I'm saying Starbucks the Starbucks and bookstores never have lights

00:02:31.01 at least where I live yeah there's zero cars at the Starbucks inside of a

00:02:35.04 bookstore at uh I will say this in aw like Austin is one of those like [ __ ]

00:02:38.22 austins of foodie city right so they have like tons of [ __ ] we're recording I

00:02:43.11 heard that uh it's time uh there's Gavin too anyway uh

00:02:47.14 austin's a coffee city and they have a bunch of snobby coffee shops but that

00:02:52.04 being said uh Starbucks has drive-throughs and every drive-through is slammed

00:02:56.08 morning Gavin good morning good morning do you drive through for coffee yeah I

00:03:00.19 drive through for coffee all the time I they got rid of the

00:03:03.11 fat free fruit swirl and I've been I lost they lost me you know what they

00:03:07.12 changed their small pies what Starbucks yes they used to have these mini apple

00:03:12.08 pies that were great oh what I'm a big fan of at Starbucks is the black coffee

00:03:17.10 and they still have it like no matter when I go no matter what time of day if

00:03:22.12 I can get through the line there's a black coffee waiting for me they never

00:03:25.23 run out they have that [ __ ] stocked to the gills I appreciate it I didn't know

00:03:31.03 until very recently that you could put cream in a black coffee I thought it

00:03:36.21 would lose its title of blackness wait what huh what did you think it becomes

00:03:42.04 well well I just I don't I thought that it immediately once you put cream in it

00:03:46.01 it was no longer a black coffee I thought a black coffee was just nothing

00:03:49.23 but the coffee isn't that what it is I think once you put in sugar it no

00:03:54.17 longer is a black coffee or is it cream as well what

00:03:58.08 I don't know I don't I don't drink coffee I I order black I will say

00:04:05.14 in uh in Australia and other places outside of the u.s if you put cream in a

00:04:11.13 coffee or milk they call it a flat white right flat white okay

00:04:16.03 so some some hemispheres I think you're correct

00:04:19.03 okay you order a black coffee in Australia they look at you like you're

00:04:22.19 an [ __ ] and you're like I get it I am but I'm not sure why

00:04:26.23 you get that reaction you're creating less work I'd assume it's the most

00:04:30.16 simplistic form of concepts I think in Australia they pride themselves on their

00:04:34.23 work when it comes to coffee that is a like commissioning a famous artist and

00:04:40.10 just being like hey can you paint me a white canvas yeah they uh they take it

00:04:45.05 so [ __ ] seriously over there they uh they're newer to the coffee game but

00:04:50.06 like I had a joke about this in Australia for stand up uh when we did

00:04:55.09 the the tour a couple years ago they uh they kicked out Starbucks

00:04:59.02 Starbucks closed 70 of all of their coffee shops in Australia it's the only

00:05:03.14 place on earth that isn't Starbucks isn't destroying and it's just because

00:05:07.16 the Australians are like it's not good enough we're that snobby about our

00:05:11.15 coffee they take it so seriously every single Australian

00:05:15.15 yeah pretty much all content have you ever felt pressure when you're in like a

00:05:19.10 restaurant of that type like a subway or something where you can customize your

00:05:22.23 order to like add things that you feel like you're being judged if you don't

00:05:26.08 have enough items on your your your meal or whatever your drink

00:05:30.06 whatever happens today I the first time I went to subway I just had a turkey

00:05:33.17 sandwich just like playing just bread and turkey and it's maybe the most

00:05:37.13 judged I've ever felt in my life oh because they like go down the line

00:05:41.07 yeah because they go down the line and there's like yup no don't want lettuce

00:05:44.23 don't want uh you can nope peppers don't want that no cheese not a big fan of

00:05:48.15 cheese no you don't need the salt and pepper at either uh don't need to toast

00:05:53.20 it just uh yeah just the bread and some turkey please thank you

00:05:58.06 is that really what you would get there no not now I've evolved since then that

00:06:03.18 was my first my first subway experience I was taken to a subway and I ordered

00:06:07.03 just a plain turkey nothing else just honey out I think or whatever the honey

00:06:11.19 bread is I feel like subway is one of the few places not that I've eaten there

00:06:15.06 the last 10 years but it's one of the few places where I can get exactly what

00:06:18.17 I want because they encourage like going down the line if there's just a place

00:06:22.11 with a menu and you have to like just say all

00:06:26.04 the modifications up front I don't ever do it because I just want to order

00:06:29.11 something that's a number typically I can't eat at subway because their bread

00:06:33.16 tastes like wet chemicals but I agree with you in theory you don't even have

00:06:37.01 to you just have to point at [ __ ] you know you know you know how but you just

00:06:40.23 point out mcdonald's is like entirely consistent no matter what

00:06:45.10 country you're in you can pretty much get what you're used to subway is in so

00:06:50.10 many places there are so many subways around the earth and they're all

00:06:55.01 completely different oh yeah it's strange to me like new Zealand makes a

00:07:00.00 lot of the bread for subway and it blows my [ __ ] mind the idea of like you

00:07:04.08 going into a subway and leaving with bread that was made in an entirely

00:07:08.12 different country it's just so weird for me to process

00:07:11.22 like all the where it was all sourced like it's [ __ ] wild I'll tell you the

00:07:15.07 weird thing is how processed that bread is for to be able to survive that trip

00:07:19.16 uh when Millie and I I'm not like I said I'm not a huge subway fan but when

00:07:23.00 Millie and I were we went to a vacation uh like a daddy daughter vacation to

00:07:26.10 Iceland a couple years ago at this point like maybe

00:07:29.20 I don't know three or seven or twelve years ago whatever it was and uh

00:07:33.14 that city I love Iceland but Reykjavik shuts down at like 7 p.m I feel like or

00:07:38.02 at least when we were there and so there were like we ate subway almost every

00:07:43.01 night because it was the only place open at like 8 p.m and our food schedule is

00:07:47.01 all backwards and so we I spent so much [ __ ] time in the subway in Reykjavik

00:07:51.03 Iceland and it it's not the same as the subway in america but it's also not good

00:07:54.18 and I bet it was expensive as [ __ ] yeah probably what what's your bread

00:07:59.05 preference what's your go-to bread in the world no not not in general in

00:08:02.19 subway not generally it's way too broad of a question we're talking subway

00:08:06.21 they've got like six spreads I like the idea that there's something that's too

00:08:10.04 broad of a question for us

00:08:12.19 [ __ ] white bread just white bread okay that's fine

00:08:16.08 I'm a flat bread guy doesn't sound like gab has been in there ten years in the

00:08:20.20 last ten years that's why remember Gavin hasn't been there since they've had six

00:08:23.22 breads uh I was I always picked the third bread

00:08:27.12 the third bread is always the best bread [Laughter]

00:08:30.19 no like 90 of the time the third bread's the best bread

00:08:34.21 dude you gotta talk about good ass bread though do they have uh jersey mike's up

00:08:40.04 in Canada no not where I live oh dude if you ever get a chance to eat jersey

00:08:46.10 mike's rosemary parm you ugh it's a shame you can only eat it once I

00:08:51.01 don't know if this is controversial I'm a quiznos guy because that's good I like

00:08:54.18 me quiznos I like quizness they've got a uh honey mustard chicken sub fantastic

00:09:00.08 it's perfect best sandwich out there in my opinion oh hey by the way should we

00:09:04.02 talk uh should we start the show yeah it's eight or six six years

00:09:10.10 hello and welcome to another episode of the F**kFuckFacePodcast my name is Geoff Ramsey

00:09:16.06 and I sure am happy you're along for the ride today uh along with us in the car

00:09:21.17 Andrew panton over there in Canada we'll have it free in Austin Texas by way of

00:09:26.21 uh her majesty's england and uh in the background making everything work

00:09:32.11 we got Eric and nick and we're all awake at eight in the morning having fun and

00:09:37.05 fellowship together wanted to start our day off right the best way to start your

00:09:43.03 day off is with a little bit of face we agree so uh

00:09:46.17 everybody got up eight o'clock for us here in Texas six a.m for Andrew

00:09:52.00 not sure who recommended that we start at 6am for Andrew but I love it and he's

00:09:57.09 been in a great mood all morning I'm great I just didn't sleep yeah it's

00:10:02.02 definitely my fault that it's at 8am but is was it my

00:10:05.09 suggestion I think it might have been I think it might have might be a double

00:10:08.12 whammy it might have been well I'm excited though this is going to be an

00:10:11.22 interesting process of a day I didn't sleep I don't know what

00:10:15.12 recording I expected the morning one to be the one I suffered it might be the

00:10:19.01 evening we might have a complete flip of what I thought would happen how many

00:10:23.18 hours till we record again uh 12

00:10:26.02 12

00:10:27.07 1314131314 hours till we record the next episode we're gonna record another

00:10:32.11 one so we're doing um uh the the morning the zany morning face show and then

00:10:38.08 it was said it was put to us that we had to do three this week and uh someone

00:10:43.02 wanted to do two on Tuesday but I'm busy

00:10:44.22 all of Tuesday so we decided just to put it at either end of the busy yeah we're

00:10:49.16 just gonna make you a little extra busy we sandwiched the business

00:10:53.23 so it even 18 a.m and one at 10 p.m eleven filming 11 p.m it's at 11.

00:11:02.23 I thought it was I thought it was 10-2 I looked last night

00:11:07.13 laughed when I saw it was 11 for you guys there's no that's 11. That's it we

00:11:11.19 [ __ ] Andrew and then at the beginning of

00:11:13.16 the day and he [ __ ] us at the end of the day that's how it works

00:11:18.08 and then nobody's happy I assume we all woke up within the last hour right

00:11:23.11 I kind of slept seven yeah that was my first question look right six isn't

00:11:30.17 three a.m like three yeah stay up right no six is

00:11:34.21 like the next day it's the next morning no no no listen Cory boy

00:11:39.16 I tried to go to sleep and I kept waking

00:11:42.13 up every 45 minutes that I slept through my alarm so I said [ __ ] it I'm just

00:11:47.22 gonna stay up and so I've just been up since like I

00:11:51.04 don't know 2am what have you been doing what have you been doing with your time

00:11:55.12 I I just uh largely in the bathtub just stretched out in the bathtub in the

00:11:59.16 general call waiting to see what was going on I said it

00:12:03.05 what time did you join the call I joined the call I tweeted whenever I

00:12:06.15 tweet I tweeted at like three a.m that I'm I'm joining the call for

00:12:09.23 pleasantries I've been in like 3am I've been ready for pleasure I'm a very

00:12:13.19 pleasant morning the way you handle something that could be just solved with

00:12:17.22 two alarms is unbelievable I set three of them I didn't trust them I didn't

00:12:21.09 trust them can you imagine not trusting three

00:12:24.06 alarms here's what I don't trust about it I changed my all of my [ __ ] alert

00:12:29.07 noises to Gavin going ooh oh no and I wasn't sure if the alarm would

00:12:33.09 also be that and I think I would sleep through that so I just I was having like

00:12:38.06 reoccurring nightmares essentially sleeping through the show

00:12:41.14 so then I couldn't get to sleep and I thought if I'm only going to sleep at

00:12:44.14 30-minute bursts like I don't know what I'll be more tired doing that I

00:12:48.16 think than if I just stay up so I'll tell you who is who's apparently the

00:12:54.10 most tired out of all of us is I just looked over is my my co-pilot Henry

00:12:58.08 Hatfield he is uh he's in his normal little day bed that he sits in

00:13:02.17 where he squeaks and he's just [ __ ]

00:13:04.16 snoring away he is out of it it is way too early in the morning for him he's

00:13:08.07 like I'm not ready to clock in on the on the squeak [ __ ]

00:13:11.14 he's gonna be disappointed Leia that he missed one yeah he is he's also

00:13:16.09 he goes to bed early too so he I doubt he'll be up at 11 pm tonight well Andrew

00:13:19.22 I think you've wrecked yourself here because you have work to do between the

00:13:23.06 recordings no I'm not this is I think I'm sharper than I've ever been with

00:13:28.00 this approach I'm I'm excited for the sandwich of a of a day and of a bet

00:13:33.12 I realized I don't have anything to lose I think based on

00:13:37.14 what we've talked about before I guess the losing is just having to do the work

00:13:43.16 what is the bet so we were playing halo like last week

00:13:47.07 and I asked Gavin a question and his response I said I think I could have had

00:13:52.19 a million guesses and I wouldn't have ever said

00:13:55.16 what the answer to the question was I mean Jordan

00:13:58.23 say the uh question I don't remember what the question was oh yes

00:14:03.05 andrew's always asking very inquisitive questions while I play halo he's uh you

00:14:07.14 know get to know each other even still to this point of course he asked me he

00:14:11.11 asked me why I was interested in or how I got into slow-mo what made me

00:14:16.00 interested in it and I said it was an episode of tom and Jerry where

00:14:20.05 I think tom makes some sort of high-speed camera to catch a very fast

00:14:24.09 mouse that's eating the cheese that he can't see with his human eyes or cat

00:14:28.02 eyes and I was like oh that's really interesting and that was like the first

00:14:31.01 thing that got me intrigued by it as a child and Andrew said that in a million

00:14:36.21 guesses he wouldn't have guessed tom and Jerry and I said to him

00:14:41.16 I don't think you could name a million things

00:14:44.01 tom and Jerry would have to be in there because I don't think he could name a

00:14:47.12 million other things I I think he's greatly underestimating how many things

00:14:51.22 I know I know so many to him I put it to him that given a day he

00:14:57.06 couldn't even name 20 thousand things so what how do you name twenty thousand

00:15:01.09 things I'm gonna open a word document and I'm

00:15:04.19 just gonna start writing the things I know

00:15:07.10 I can you do can you do a favor can you do can I add to this of course

00:15:11.18 after you complete your word document can you record yourself saying the twenty

00:15:15.23 thousand things that's a great idea I would love to release that as a piece of

00:15:20.02 content so I didn't consider that twenty thousand things so

00:15:23.11 that the bet is if I can complete the twenty 000 things Gavin has to print them

00:15:29.16 we had a debate about font size it has to be a single digit font size should be

00:15:35.01 no higher than font size nine no higher than font size and I don't

00:15:39.00 know I don't know how many pages that's gonna be but I'm very excited I'm I'm

00:15:42.16 committed to this but we need to clarify a few things so we just need to make

00:15:45.18 sure the rules I don't want to break any rules or cheat so what what are the

00:15:49.06 rules what are the restrictions I can't copy and paste you can't copy and paste

00:15:53.02 I think you can't you can't just like Google things I'm not allowed to Google

00:15:56.13 at all I think you just have to sit in front of a word pad a notepad and just

00:16:01.01 think away at 20000 different things what if I walk away for a little bit and

00:16:05.19 I get inspiration like what if a seagull flies by my window and I'm like fine

00:16:09.23 absolutely fine okay so it's anything that I can think of as well as what I

00:16:14.04 encounter in the world without specifically searching for it yeah and

00:16:18.03 you can't just write a list of words like a word isn't a thing okay

00:16:22.13 but you could write Google google's a thing Google Google here's the thing yeah

00:16:27.07 I'll do that Google what about whatever okay what about can I can I do multiple

00:16:31.07 things if they're different if they're different things but they're they're

00:16:35.11 written the same what do you mean can I claim pork and beans the food and

00:16:40.13 pork and beans the weezer song yes yeah that's what she thinks okay

00:16:45.01 [ __ ] easy I could do this by the time we're done recording this is gonna index

00:16:48.12 really high on Google by the way when we release this because the number one

00:16:52.04 thing when you search for 20000 things is just 20000 things you can buy with

00:16:57.20 20000 huh I should have I in my head andrew's gonna be

00:17:00.09 flying out of the gate thing thing thing it's gonna be crazy it's gonna be not

00:17:04.13 gonna stop but after about 4000 things a few hours in I think he's really going

00:17:09.17 to be struggling for things you think 4

00:17:11.17 000 is the line I'm gonna hit yeah I think you I think that would be a wool

00:17:16.11 do you think like that's like the bad part of the marathon when you're like I

00:17:19.22 don't know if I can do it I'm at mile 19. I can't believe I have seven more to

00:17:23.05 go well because you've got to have all this done by 11 p.m tonight yes so how

00:17:28.12 many things is so how many hours till what is that that's going to be 13

00:17:34.02 hours so 20000 divided by 13

00:17:36.11 is 1538 things an hour divided by 60. Okay I have another question 25 things a

00:17:43.11 minute oh you can do a thing every two seconds that's fine

00:17:48.02 I have another rules clarification yeah I don't have a portable computer

00:17:53.07 if I go on the road can I use my phone and then copy and paste what I wrote in

00:17:57.11 my phone to my word document well here's the thing that you're to want is you're

00:18:00.21 going to want access to the word document because I assume you want to

00:18:04.16 have a system where you pre I assume you don't have a system oh my computer's

00:18:09.12 freaking out so it's like flashing my face it's like

00:18:13.01 blinding me I don't know what's going on it's like someone not only

00:18:17.00 I'm sure peter always does this at 816

00:18:19.16 every morning you just never wait to see it

00:18:21.12 I've never seen a computer issue cause somebody to have a human issue like you

00:18:25.14 lost the inability to speak because your computer was broken now what it is is

00:18:29.20 that my screen saver tries to start but it freaks out for like five seconds

00:18:33.09 flashing [ __ ] in my face before it actually starts

00:18:36.11 here's what you're gonna want you're gonna want it so that when you press

00:18:41.11 enter it numbers uh it like increments one number

00:18:43.19 yes I agree you know what it counted as you go so either your Google doc or you

00:18:47.18 need a word doc that you can I think Google doc well okay who has to

00:18:52.00 verify that there's 20000 if that breaks is it me I have to do that

00:18:55.15 independently later because I'm saying let's say it's let's

00:18:59.11 say we get to six o'clock and I'm running out of thanks

00:19:02.03 if I just go to a bookstore and just look around at the books

00:19:05.22 I can't bring my computer with me do I have to catalog that well first of all

00:19:10.05 can I copy and paste if I write it on my phone to then my computer and then do I

00:19:14.20 have to catalog that properly within my time limit or can I do that after it

00:19:18.20 seems that Eric is is wanting to chime in with some rules here just use a

00:19:22.18 Google doc you can get the numbered thing because you can take a Google doc

00:19:27.03 on your phone it's a great point you don't have to

00:19:30.10 copy and paste anything it is just it's in a cloud which is not a place but a

00:19:35.18 thing that you can access and then I'm telling you this the numbering is on

00:19:41.08 you this is I'm being crystal clear the numbering from the beginning it

00:19:46.16 better start with one and go sequentially this is not a oh man it started

00:19:51.20 numbering and then it became dots it better be numbers front to back here

00:19:56.21 here's another clarification do I need to label the specific things can I just

00:20:01.22 write pork and beans twice or do I have to write pork and beans song pork and

00:20:07.00 beans you have to you have yeah because we're not going to go through 20000

00:20:10.09 things and go what did you mean by pork and beans twice and you go I don't know

00:20:14.09 because when we started this you said I don't remember the question you asked me

00:20:18.10 so yeah clarify the best that you can yeah we're gonna have to search for

00:20:21.21 duplicates at the end right yeah to make sure and if there are two of the same

00:20:26.10 entry without an in-brackets clarification of two different things

00:20:30.13 then we've got a problem I think I should get a window to clarify and if I

00:20:34.12 can't and that's clearly I [ __ ] up and I will take a loss on that and worst

00:20:38.11 case scenario if he doesn't number it we can always just copy it and paste it

00:20:42.02 into excel and count okay if if he doesn't number it then Geoff can copy it

00:20:46.06 and paste it into excel I don't know what you would give I don't

00:20:49.18 know why you would give him an inch why why would you give him a niche I learned

00:20:53.04 this from gus I learned this from guess why would you give him an inch why

00:20:58.15 to what to who's benefit to the audience the insane Google docs I'll make this

00:21:02.21 right now things I know I don't know many things but I do know a lot of things

00:21:08.01 I don't know many things but I do know exactly 20000.

00:21:11.04 Yes how many do you think I'll get Geoff what do you think of the odds of this

00:21:15.07 coming together I think you'll you'll get as far into this as your as your

00:21:20.01 decision to watch all of season two of salt lake city uh real housewives so I

00:21:26.00 imagine one you'll get one in I'm trying I'm trying yeah it's not hard as if

00:21:31.09 what was if you if I win nothing we didn't that was a mistake I

00:21:36.02 think on your end as we agreed to the terms and I think my punishment is that

00:21:41.05 I spent my day attempting to write 20

00:21:44.21 000 things that I'd ever at every point of especially the

00:21:48.16 fact that I haven't really slept going into this day at every moment of this

00:21:53.00 day after we're done recording you will know exactly what I'm trying to do

00:21:58.04 unless you knock out 20000 things by lunch that's true

00:22:02.04 oh dude write down lunch that's one of the things that's that's great

00:22:06.15 I'm just thinking about all the breads in subway since

00:22:09.17 since we decided this he's been texting me just the occasional thing gotta

00:22:13.03 stretch my prowess gotta show him I'm the real baby earlier this week he

00:22:17.20 he just text me wheel of fortune paprika two different things right there.

00:22:23.11 [Laughter]

00:22:24.21 I

00:22:30.19 He's just giving me options it's I don't know what he's doing he's not taking

00:22:35.18 this seriously I can't wait to see how many pages this [ __ ]

00:22:39.23 thing.

00:22:42.00 I can't figure out because it's such a weird task I can't figure out whether

00:22:46.12 it's really difficult or really easy I think it's impossible you think it's

00:22:50.21 impossible you're not gonna do this you're not gonna come close

00:22:53.20 you think it's impossible I'll be amazed if you get the three thousand really

00:22:59.07 you're gonna lose you're gonna lose your mind I don't think so I'm excited to

00:23:03.20 present this list later it's the day it's a funny idea for about 20 minutes

00:23:07.19 and then you look up and you're like I still have 12 hours and I better I'm

00:23:11.12 behind I gotta get going that's your miscalculation I don't think this is

00:23:15.12 funny at all I just think this is gonna be a thing I can do I don't think it's

00:23:19.07 gonna be difficult I don't think it's amusing going in I I'm just so

00:23:23.18 interested to find out where you stopped because you're going to have

00:23:28.10 so many things ready to go in your head you're literally not going to stop

00:23:33.01 typing at the beginning until you don't have a word ready to go so

00:23:36.20 I'm fascinated to know is that 50 words in or is that a thousand I don't I have

00:23:41.19 no idea when that will be for you so how many what's the math on this I need 25

00:23:46.03 words a minute for the entirety of yeah yeah yeah uh and the longer you're on

00:23:50.12 this podcast the less time you have that's a lot that's true I calculated 13

00:23:54.12 hours but it'll be four it'll be 12

00:23:57.01 hours when no is that right I got a heart out now well I mean we might who

00:24:00.04 knows how long we're going to go for that I do I do

00:24:03.21 I know how long I'll be here got words to write I got a document to make three

00:24:07.19 thousand you could be right I could be greatly it reminds me of there is uh in

00:24:12.23 the challenge one of the eliminations was you had to lift

00:24:16.01 a thing filled with random items and one of the items was watermelons so

00:24:20.13 like the two people have to go back and forth and be like I can lift 40

00:24:23.22 watermelons and eventually one of you would say

00:24:26.18 do it and if you did it then the other person was eliminated and if you

00:24:30.07 couldn't then you were eliminated and I think they got the like 33 watermelons

00:24:34.01 and the guys like do it and the other guy just lifted it effortlessly and he

00:24:38.08 was like I guess I don't really know what a watermelon weighs like there's no

00:24:42.05 I've never considered so we're gonna find out I could be

00:24:45.23 greatly overestimating this word thing the math

00:24:49.08 problem why don't we do a test minute no I can't do a test minute what if we

00:24:54.01 just start a minute you have to name vocally and this is great practice

00:24:58.21 things endlessly for the minute could you do it uh well I'm in the dark so

00:25:03.18 this is gonna be a uh I would I'd rather be in light to do okay turn the lights

00:25:08.04 on like no no no no no no wait you're like

00:25:11.02 can I write these I did pay my electric bill can I raise

00:25:15.03 this could be preliminary work so I get one minute right now and I could put in

00:25:19.12 whatever I want to for the next minute yeah yeah are you gonna type as you as

00:25:24.23 you say or are you gonna just say uh I think I I'm gonna type I'm going to

00:25:28.23 type as I say okay let me I mean I made a Google doc I don't want to do that I

00:25:32.11 want to make a spreadsheet go to Google spreadsheets so one minute yeah I can do

00:25:37.01 whatever I want and I'll give you the go ahead and I'll time it for a minute

00:25:40.21 okay this is going to be I didn't expect this this is a this is a

00:25:45.07 sneaky tactic by you you caught me off my game [Laughter]

00:25:48.12 I was not prepared for this okay all right let me know when you're

00:25:52.19 ready I'm loading in right now I'm not even gonna name the spreadsheet okay

00:25:58.08 ready all right give me a candy cane we can't

00:26:01.16 death for one minute you better you have to say say out loud as you type so we

00:32:10.19 to oh do I have to say why oh [ __ ]

00:32:13.12 in general it's generic why do you why do you think I would be sorry uh

00:32:17.14 oh is it oh is it because when you were mad but I didn't realize you were bad no

00:32:22.00 no that's funny uh that was just me being fully funny uh I was only

00:32:25.03 pretending that anyway uh when I told you I was taking a timeout for my

00:32:28.16 friendship [Laughter]

00:32:32.04 and then you you started texting me and I told you I would only respond to you

00:32:36.04 during work hours because we're co-writers I wanted just to add some some

00:32:41.11 additional context to that Geoff we were playing halo at that time or maybe it

00:32:44.22 was after and Gavin was like I think Geoff's really mad at us I think he's mad

00:32:48.23 at me there's genuine concern in gavin's part

00:32:51.21 that you oh good well you know yeah I was worried I get it I'm the best friend

00:32:55.08 anybody could have I would hate to [ __ ]

00:32:57.01 that up too uh no I apologize to you Gavin because when we planned this

00:33:02.08 I promised I I said that I was going to get up early and I was going to drive to

00:33:06.04 get breakfast for you and I was going to take it at your house oh yeah

00:33:10.11 and I didn't but I it was on the agenda I actually had a plan I was gonna go

00:33:14.11 yesterday and I was gonna buy a bunch of uh I was gonna buy a bunch of uh

00:33:18.17 cucumbers and I was gonna stick them in a bag and then I was gonna throw

00:33:22.18 I was gonna throw I was going to go to taco burrito or some taco place get a

00:33:26.16 couple breakfast tacos throw them in a bag with cucumbers and I was going to

00:33:29.16 scale the side of your house throw them in there and then leave and then tell

00:33:34.13 you on camera like we were in the podcast that they were tacos waiting for you

00:33:39.14 I didn't get I didn't get to it because of uh I had a bad day yesterday and uh

00:33:46.06 it threw me off my game but uh do you guys remember sorry go ahead

00:33:50.02 oh I think that was I'm fine with that apology because

00:33:53.14 it's sort of you messing with me you're apologizing for not messing with me yeah

00:33:58.10 I mean the tacos would have still been good tacos

00:34:01.00 that's true if you'd if you'd have replaced them entirely with cucumbers no

00:34:05.12 that would have been cucumbers and real tacos I just have decided that I'm never

00:34:10.21 going to put anything on your front door unless it

00:34:15.07 includes cucumbers from here on out uh I uh you guys remember how like for

00:34:21.03 about a solid year I had um just a tremendous amount of teeth problems

00:34:25.10 yes yeah well.

00:34:28.00 I hesitate oh my god no do you guys remember that root canal

00:34:35.20 I got that which five the five root canals in one tooth

00:34:40.04 not the surprise uh the root canal no not the other two but the the initial

00:34:45.08 one that kicked it all off yeah five sets like two months I had another dude

00:34:50.21 Geoff has had so many root canals that it could be like a police lineup that we

00:34:55.01 need to try to identify there's like seven of them it's like root canal three

00:34:59.05 and five please step forward and say ow Geoffree canal too Geoffree canal three

00:35:05.14 I uh I was eating some hard candy on Saturday oh no

00:35:09.18 I bit on it and uh I just had like a weird pain in the back of my

00:35:14.11 one of my my one of my molars and I thought oh that's weird a little

00:35:19.01 sensitive and then Sunday it started to be a little sore Monday morning I woke

00:35:24.13 up from the pain at about 5 a.m excruciating and [Music]

00:35:29.11 went to the dentist and uh there's a it's a long like six hour story about

00:35:37.16 just incompetence and [ __ ] going wrong and usually I delight in telling those

00:35:43.00 but I don't want to yell right now because my mouth yes and I just I don't

00:35:46.13 have the I don't have the energy to be angry so I'm not going to go into all

00:35:49.14 the particular ways the dentist and the pharmacy

00:35:53.01 and everyone in Austin [ __ ] me over yesterday but every one of you

00:35:58.03 [ __ ] know who you are every single one of you knows what your

00:36:03.01 incompetence did to me knows the hours it took out of my life knows the pain

00:36:08.02 you caused me and karma will find you I'll tell you that right now

00:36:12.21 you six or seven just miserable sons of [ __ ] out there

00:36:17.07 it's not going to be me but some the universe will get revenge for what

00:36:20.20 you've done to me I'll just say that that's all I'm going to say for

00:36:23.16 everything that went on yesterday that's all I'm going to say I'm too upset to

00:36:27.09 talk to get into it but I went to the dentist eventually uh and uh

00:36:32.00 they were like oh yeah looks like uh I'm not gonna get mad once they once I

00:36:36.06 convinced them that it was the tooth that it was I didn't have to fight with

00:36:40.04 the lady anymore is this the same dentist

00:36:42.09 well that's part of the problem that's part of the problem uh I went to my

00:36:46.03 dentist and my dentist is no longer there my dental company is a different

00:36:50.03 has a different name on it now my dentist's office and most of the people

00:36:52.13 are there but my dentist is gone and so all of a sudden I have a new dentist

00:36:56.06 under I have no idea what happened there uh but it made me think about a story

00:37:01.18 uh which I can get into later uh so anyway I got to meet a new dentist

00:37:05.05 yesterday under a new name because my dental company is now something else and

00:37:09.12 uh they took an x-ray eventually when they figured out how to take x-rays at

00:37:13.12 the place where they take x-rays all day every day

00:37:15.22 and uh they were like oh yeah it looks like uh when you had your root canal um

00:37:21.07 maybe that sometimes there can be like a

00:37:23.10 side channel that doesn't get seen can't wasn't showed up and anyway so you've

00:37:27.14 got like a little infection there uh so we'll just need to um we'll just need to

00:37:32.06 go in and take that out and I go please do because this is like I'm in

00:37:36.06 excruciating pain and she's like well I can't you know it's you're gonna have to

00:37:39.22 go to the endodontist who did it last time because they have like a special

00:37:43.05 equipment to get into this thing and so um uh best of luck and so I called the

00:37:48.06 endodontist eventually there were a bunch of uh

00:37:51.09 points of failure between the these times

00:37:54.12 and uh when when I eventually convinced them to give me the correct endodontist

00:38:00.00 uh I argued that successfully uh the endodontist was like yeah we can

00:38:05.01 see you next Thursday and I was like boy I'm in a lot of pain

00:38:09.12 today and they're like yeah cool uh we'll hold on to that and we'll see you

00:38:13.16 next Thursday so I called every endodontist in Austin

00:38:17.13 and uh no one can see me ironically every endodontist in the city uh in the

00:38:22.16 11th largest city of america the uh Austin Texas every endodontist has an

00:38:27.23 appointment next Thursday nothing between now and next Thursday

00:38:33.20 probably 3030 endodontists all are free next Thursday

00:38:38.21 do you think that's very busy very busy between now and then some of

00:38:43.18 them not all of them uh so uh anyway the pain was unbearable uh I asked for

00:38:51.12 pain meds uh to which they uh refused to give me uh so I am uh

00:38:57.07 but they did give me antibiotics and they swore that the antibiotics mixed

00:39:01.23 with motrin would help it go away and so

00:39:04.11 yesterday was one of the longest days of most painful days of my life uh and uh

00:39:09.11 eventually it did go away and I was able to get to sleep and so far so good this

00:39:13.05 morning although it's tentative but um yeah I gotta get another root canal next

00:39:17.09 Thursday I gotta re-root canal my my rooted canal

00:39:20.20 because they didn't root canal the first five times weren't enough so next

00:39:24.15 Thursday uh I'm getting uh my first and hopefully

00:39:28.05 only root canal of 2022 thought the other three were behind me thought the

00:39:31.18 13 months of hell dental health were behind me but turns out they were it was

00:39:35.05 it was just uh there was like a little little bomb waiting in my mouth

00:39:40.02 at what point do you just pull them all out get a completely fake set of teeth

00:39:45.22 um I dude I'm I I I don't know soon [Laughter]

00:39:49.15 [ __ ] who needs teeth I feel like you may be close to setting

00:39:54.17 a record for the most root canals on a singular tooth you have to be near it

00:39:59.21 yeah what is this this is I don't even like

00:40:02.22 this [ __ ] tooth anymore no this would be I mean one root canal

00:40:07.07 that took five sessions right and then uh so this will be this and this will be

00:40:14.12 retreating that canal so this would be the sixth time they've drilled into this

00:40:20.01 for this problem do you have a ranking of teeth do you have a favorite tooth uh

00:40:24.03 I have a Lisa I have a least favorite tooth I'll tell you that there's a

00:40:27.22 bottom tier yeah I will say on the bright side one

00:40:30.22 piece of good news we haven't really talked about it but one piece of good

00:40:35.09 news uh guess who tested negative for covid today finally yeah hey

00:40:40.17 13 days straight testing positive with no symptoms and this was an at home test

00:40:47.09 or is this like at home test I'm gonna after this I'm gonna leave and go get a

00:40:52.12 test at roost but uh yeah finally my first negative I I've

00:40:57.01 been living in my spare bedroom for two weeks

00:40:59.06 not interacting with my girlfriend uh well I've interacted with Millie because

00:41:05.05 she was also uh had it for a little bit but um she got better weeks ago or

00:41:08.22 forever ago so yeah uh as of today I can by the way people don't give a [ __ ]

00:41:12.00 about covid I told the dentist I'm like I I'm testing positive for covered but I

00:41:14.10 don't have symptoms I haven't in over a

00:41:16.04 week and they're like where are you [ __ ]

00:41:18.03 come on in so wow yeah that's interesting and then in your mouth

00:41:22.08 yeah I know that's what I was thinking too where it is yeah they were like

00:41:27.01 do you think that there's any connection to that and and everybody on the planet

00:41:30.23 only willing to see you in a future Thursday do you think there's anything I

00:41:34.23 don't know I don't know I don't know maybe that's

00:41:38.15 what did it maybe a little bit covered go in your tooth so I googled that

00:41:43.04 at five in the morning when I was in excruciating pain and uh yeah there's I

00:41:47.12 read that Google has some people that are saying that but then I talked to the

00:41:50.21 dentist and the dentist was like that's stupid so

00:41:54.01 imagine if that created a new variant yeah god damn enamel crown [Laughter]

00:42:03.11 well that sucks that's the worst I don't know it's great I don't have code

00:42:08.12 anymore it's awesome the other part sucks I'm just trying to be positive

00:42:14.00 is there any I don't I don't understand how dentistry works

00:42:18.08 why haven't you just pulled that tooth at this point what is the reason for

00:42:21.22 keeping it why are we holding onto this tooth I assume I need it to chew and

00:42:27.14 stuff I feel like you certainly have enough of

00:42:30.17 other teeth I mean I'd rather when in doubt keep your teeth

00:42:34.16 I think for sure I think we've crossed the line of doubt though

00:42:39.05 I guess that's right I'd put the statement oh man I got uh

00:42:43.07 I got a lot of time and money invested in this tooth I'm not giving up on it

00:42:46.17 I'm not letting it throw in the tooth towel [ __ ] no

00:42:49.16 I am uh I am uh bound and determined that this will be the only time I do

00:42:53.07 this this year though well Andrew do you have have you you seem to have very

00:42:57.11 little experience with a dentist do you have your wisdom teeth and stuff yes I

00:43:01.05 do I haven't had them removed and they're

00:43:03.18 fine they didn't come in like all messed up no yeah well I don't I don't yeah I

00:43:08.02 think I'm good I'm actually I'm I'm heavily relying on those wisdom teeth

00:43:11.23 for the [Laughter]

00:43:25.03 tooth if the first if the first two if the first 500 things you wrote you write

00:43:32.06 are sequential to this podcast we'll know

00:43:35.14 you were cheating and writing [ __ ] down now but while the podcast was going oh

00:43:38.22 he'll have to mix them up in the spreadsheet to throw yeah if he writes

00:43:42.13 like he writes like cucumber bag taco breakfast

00:43:46.19 tooth covered negative positive test we're gonna know buddy root

00:43:52.04 canal root canal canal that's three things right there

00:44:00.04 just think of all the compound words you can turn into three things that's

00:44:04.12 amazing um what would you so you're invested in this tooth

00:44:09.05 is there any thought of if you pulled it turning it into something else

00:44:14.04 you're a chain guy would you ever have like the tooth on a

00:44:18.12 chain like maybe a gold could you dip it in gold what could you do with this

00:44:24.04 tooth if I were to have this tooth removed

00:44:27.15 what I would do is I would uh I would put it in a trebuchet and I would launch

00:44:33.12 it to the moon I want it as far away from me and

00:44:38.00 this planet and our atmosphere and the gravity of earth as possible I would

00:44:44.02 like to break through and launch it into deep space and I would like it to float

00:44:49.11 through eternity uh every day getting further and further away from my mouth

00:44:54.19 you're either in my mouth or you are against my mouth and if you are against

00:44:59.16 my mouth you better get as far the [ __ ] away from my mouth as you can

00:45:03.16 muster and don't ever stop don't it's not far enough no matter how far you've

00:45:07.08 traveled through the universe it's not far enough away keep going

00:45:11.05 now outside of the things in your mouth is there anything else against your

00:45:14.16 mouth or is everything against your mouth currently in your mouth the

00:45:18.06 there's nothing against my mouth right now okay and I have a tooth and I are

00:45:22.00 having a bit of a disagreement that's been going on for about 15 months but

00:45:26.10 we're gonna work it out through a lot of pain

00:45:30.04 a lot of drilling a lot of discomfort a lot of sweating a lot of gripping the

00:45:33.22 seat and praying that like waiting to raise my hand because it still hurts all

00:45:39.18 that uh all the trauma uh that I've endured over the last year and a half uh

00:45:44.15 ahead of me next week I'm supposed to go

00:45:47.01 out of town this weekend how the [ __ I am I um so are we gonna have to move

00:45:58.05 oh great faces or the the no no my tooth deal is at 730. And I've done half of

00:46:03.11 the podcasts I've done have been after a root canal so I I just that's true are

00:46:08.08 we recording normal time Thursday I assume if Gavin can ask are you around a

00:46:13.22 record gup uh I think so okay I'm excited I was we got mvp2 on the

00:46:29.10 that's a great question I don't I don't know it's not coming out hopefully it

00:46:33.23 comes out before this so people will [Laughter]

00:46:37.08 understand what goes into planning anything which by the way I would like

00:46:41.11 to say uh if the audience has watched that I don't listen to that like 2025

00:46:46.08 minute little thing we did uh that wasn't for

00:46:50.00 content right that's just what it's like we just decided to record because we

00:46:55.15 were we had just been recording but that's what it's like for Eric I would

00:46:59.08 say seven out of ten times he has to schedule anything for us but Barrett can

00:47:03.16 weigh in on that yeah by the time this is out so this is episode number 92

00:47:08.13 this will be out uh the first week of march um that supplemental piece will

00:47:12.15 have come out after 91 so on the uh like the 25th 26th so you can you can listen

00:47:17.03 to that now uh just know that we started rolling on that probably

00:47:22.13 halfway through the conversation of trying to get that schedule so before

00:47:28.23 what you hear there's another 15 minutes

00:47:31.19 of trying to get an answer and trying to get things scheduled

00:47:35.09 so we just decided I guess we'll just start rolling on this and see what

00:47:39.03 happens uh halfway through trying to figure it out um yeah and that's and that

00:47:44.17 like what happened just now was a very small piece of that where

00:47:50.04 hey will you be here for next for Thursday when we do this episode and

00:47:56.07 Gavin just gave a maybe

00:47:59.01 but as established a maybe is yes just I feel very strongly about

00:48:04.03 the way today and tomorrow go we'll determine that [Laughter]

00:48:10.15 is there any is there any way we can influence today to go well like

00:48:15.03 we need help I can be on set again we can push it later

00:48:22.06 to guarantee that I'll be there the recording yeah

00:48:26.06 for next Thursday yeah for the 17th you want to push it later

00:48:30.23 why if you if you want a definite answer yeah you can push it later if you need

00:48:36.10 to hold on this Thursday right this Thursday are you talking

00:48:40.15 about the 10th or the 17th I think we're talking the 10th here we're not we're

00:48:43.19 talking this week I assume and not we're talking about we're talking whenever

00:48:49.16 Geoff said next Thursday is when he can get his tooth worked on that's on me

00:48:54.19 that's hey I haven't slept that's on me I missed that I thought we're talking

00:48:58.21 this Thursday don't use that as an excuse you said you

00:49:01.16 feel great you feel sharper than ever yeah

00:49:04.11 you're not allowed to say well I didn't sleep listen you're firing on all

00:49:09.05 cylinders this is right down cylinder dulled quickly

00:49:12.13 this is a dull knife at this stage we're not literally

00:49:16.08 I think that minute you did really Gavin strategically took the win out of

00:49:22.13 my sales at that minute is what that was right down the wind right on sales.

00:49:29.09 I was not ready for it he made me sprint

00:49:32.12 in a marathon and I gotta re-gather I've hit that wall

00:49:36.04 Andrew I've also found out it's bailing on this weekend's donkey Kong wow

00:49:53.12 okay that's not true I I never this weekend

00:49:57.14 is a no-go cannot do this weekend and that was established so if I did say

00:50:02.23 that I think you misheard I think I said the weekend after the one that that

00:50:08.08 episode came out on right but that's it came out today

00:50:12.21 the weekend after so it would be not this weekend the following weekend the

00:50:17.22 weekend after the episode is this weekend the weekend no the weekend after

00:50:22.16 okay the week of the episode so you're doing so you were strategic and that

00:50:28.14 yes this is a weekend night like I've I can't there's I have stuff can't do it

00:50:32.17 this weekend it's busy man established so the following weekend but then I

00:50:37.07 think we have this exact same conversation and the next one we record

00:50:42.02 and it is the same day it's just more clear in your defense of being confused I

00:50:46.09 remember feeling confused after establishing that because I knew there

00:50:49.15 was one weekend in February I couldn't do but yeah I'm not worried about that

00:50:53.19 either I think that'll be easy I'm excited and and as a reminder you're

00:50:58.17 playing all the way to the end of donkey Kong 64. All the way to the end to the

00:51:02.12 credits can we 44 hours to do 4040.

00:51:05.01 We're really okay 44 hours that's a great point we're also really bad at so

00:51:10.02 if I win you have to wear 64 pieces of clothing on an rt podcast what happens

00:51:15.20 if I lose you have to eat 64 bananas oh yes one every day I have to eat a banana

00:51:20.02 every day for 64 days okay thank you stakes have been reset we know the

00:51:23.18 schedule I can't imagine what day 65 is gonna be like for you

00:51:28.17 like will it be the best non-banana day of your life or will you be like yeah

00:51:33.22 you know I'm kind of used to bananas now I'm kind of missing I think he'll miss

00:51:37.14 one anyway I think so too I think he'll become a banana stand

00:51:40.06 I don't think I don't like the texture the taste don't dude remember he said

00:51:45.01 bananas he didn't say what kind of bananas there are more than a thousand

00:51:48.11 different variants of that's true it's like apples people just don't

00:51:52.11 realize they all everybody's all in on the cavendish banana I think it's

00:51:56.02 cavendish right but uh but there's like there's many different textures and

00:52:01.07 styles and colors and shapes of banana maybe not shapes but the other parts

00:52:06.06 for you to explore what's your favorite banana shape [Laughter]

00:52:13.12 would you enjoy banana if it was shaped like an apple and had like a

00:52:17.21 you peeled it in the same way what do you mean like it just looks like

00:52:23.03 an apple but everything else about it is a banana yeah

00:52:26.04 no my issue with the banana isn't the visual of the banana it's the texture I

00:52:30.17 actually think the visual the banana is pretty good I think it's a visually a

00:52:35.20 pretty appealing fruit I agree it's fun to open

00:52:38.01 it is I had a banana yesterday it was [ __ ] awesome

00:52:43.14 what's so funny about that it's a lot of passion

00:52:48.17 yeah well it's it's soft man I can I can't but if I look at like

00:52:53.05 if you make eye contact with my tooth it knows

00:52:58.04 I'm so bummed that you have to go through that again yeah me too that's

00:53:03.02 the [ __ ] worst it's my own personal hell it is really I'm not even kidding

00:53:07.20 like the worst thing that I can imagine I felt such a sense of relief to be

00:53:12.06 finally done with all of that nightmare especially after the last after the last

00:53:17.18 tooth uh the last week and I was pretty rough uh and uh

00:53:21.12 I thought well at least that was the last one I can't yell because because

00:53:27.03 the pain yeah I'm [ __ ] I'm gonna go insane

00:53:31.12 this I get I get that movie joker now yeah yeah

00:53:36.15 I don't know I like I like enthused banana Geoff if this is that's a

00:53:42.00 by-product of this tooth issue I'm always eating a banana well I know

00:53:46.20 but it's a different your delivery of it was [ __ ] awesome was like you looking

00:53:52.02 out into a field or something like the grizzled grizzled banana vet

00:53:56.03 it's [ __ ] like reminiscing about the good old days like

00:54:00.06 I had a banana the other day I've got that thousand yard potassium stain.

00:54:05.12 [Laughter]

00:54:06.21 You guys know the phrase thousand yard stare comes from the military are you

00:54:09.21 familiar with that phrase I associate it with that but I don't I don't yeah it's

00:54:13.10 like it's it's a phrase that they say like guys in the military who have

00:54:16.10 killed people in action who have been in battle uh have what's called a thousand

00:54:19.20 yard stare yeah or they just kind of see through things uh that's [ __ ] real I

00:54:23.12 know a lot of dudes in the army that had that that is uh yeah I don't know I

00:54:27.08 don't know anybody who was in combat who didn't have that is it just a case of

00:54:30.21 like when there's nothing else to think about your mind just goes back to that

00:54:34.10 and you just stare off into the distance I think it must be right it's like it's

00:54:38.12 always I never really talked about it well I had one friend who had a bad and

00:54:42.18 I talked about it with him a little bit but yeah he was like he was a gunner

00:54:48.04 on a helicopter in panama and uh he uh in some incursion and yeah he was

00:54:53.18 like he couldn't he would get choked up if he talked about it too much but yeah

00:54:57.05 dude if you just like idle time they would just sit and I can't imagine the

00:55:01.05 horrors replaying through their minds but

00:55:03.07 you know this has to be the only time in the history of the world in which a

00:55:07.16 person was expecting to hear a banana fact and instead was sideswiped by the

00:55:13.01 horrors of war listen listen we don't talk about it a lot but

00:55:17.18 I spent five years in the united states army so I got it's a totally fantastic I

00:55:22.01 just was not prepared for that I was I was still thinking about the potassium

00:55:27.18 stare and the banana peels I was thinking Mario kart and you guys

00:55:32.10 know very real do you guys know where the origin of uh slipping on banana

00:55:36.10 pills came from no so I'm this is I have a faulty memory so I'm gonna be going

00:55:41.12 off memory but uh so I I may be getting a few facts wrong but uh I believe uh

00:55:47.09 around the turn of the century turn the 19th century 20th century uh

00:55:52.14 littering was a huge [ __ ] deal in new york uh and people would just throw

00:55:57.03 trash around and I guess bananas were very popular because they were cheap and

00:56:00.19 easy to come by and you could carry them around they had a handle

00:56:03.23 and people were throwing [ __ ] banana peels and trash all over the street so

00:56:07.13 they started to say like if you throw a banana peel on the ground they're not

00:56:10.15 slippery but you could slip and break your leg it was like a scare tactic to

00:56:13.15 get people to stop littering but they are slippery have you ever stood on one

00:56:17.20 uh no maybe I don't think I've ever I don't think I've ever

00:56:21.23 I don't think I've ever slept on a banana peel

00:56:25.13 here we go uh here we go I [ __ ] got it right here hold on hazard

00:56:31.18 okay in comical context banana peel is also part of a classic physical comedy

00:56:37.11 slapstick visual gag the slipping of the banana peel the gag was already seen as

00:56:41.16 classic in 1920s america it is traced back to the late 19th century when

00:56:45.02 banana peel waste was considered a public hazard in a number of American

00:56:48.05 towns although banana peel slipping jokes date back to the 1850s they became

00:56:52.01 more popular beginning the 1860s where large-scale importation of bananas made

00:56:56.13 them more readily available uh slipping out of banana peels oh

00:57:01.18 I guess it was a it says slipping out of banana peel was at one point a real

00:57:06.15 concern with municipal ordinances governing the disposal of the peel yeah

00:57:10.13 so I guess it is from a little bit of truth

00:57:13.06 maybe that's why the caution wet sign is yellow think about that.

00:57:24.10 I love I love uh oh well check it out before banana peel

00:57:30.21 jokes came into vogue orange peels and sometimes peach skins

00:57:35.09 were generally seen as funny as well as dangerous as well so it's just a fruit

00:57:41.04 problem fruit it's a problem and no it's a it's a [ __ ] people are disgusting

00:57:46.21 problem is what it is people were littering in such droves that they had

00:57:51.14 to do something about it at least it's biodegradable that's true I was really

00:57:55.15 expecting that to be a war story I'm really like my reads for where these

00:58:00.17 banana tails are gonna go yeah I have no sense of it this isn't a bob for me

00:58:06.00 I had a terrible terrible guidance son if we're going to [ __ ] of war actual

00:58:10.11 fun banana facts.

00:58:14.00 I don't think I have any more fun banana facts hold on is the banana the

00:58:19.12 slipperiest fruit it's definitely the most like it's the

00:58:22.13 poster for slippery food I mean as as someone who worked in a supermarket I

00:58:28.06 watched a lot of old people eat it on grapes it was like

00:58:32.10 when I was at work at wait rose it was my number one area to check because

00:58:38.19 one grape goes on the floor and an old an old lady will bite it

00:58:42.23 it was I was making a pass every like 10

00:58:46.19 15 minutes under the grapes just making because people are animals people

00:58:50.06 they're picking through the grapes they eat them they drop and they don't give a

00:58:54.15 [ __ ]

00:58:55.18 People go down did you guys know that bananas are

00:58:59.19 radioactive they contain small amounts of the isotope potassium 40.

00:59:04.06 It is yeah well I think when originally the 64 banana talk was happening Gavin

00:59:09.23 was scared I'd die from the radiation it says for it to be harmful you'd need

00:59:15.12 to eat close to 700 bananas a day for 80

00:59:18.21 years oh damn better get to it we got another we got another bet

00:59:24.17 that's about to say can you imagine somebody who's like 30 years into it

00:59:32.23 we've been trying to get him to stop for 30 years but he just will not stop

00:59:38.01 eating 700 bananas a day dude bananas cure depression if somebody ate 700

00:59:42.04 bananas a day they'd be the most mentally adjusted person on earth I mean

00:59:46.10 okay if it kills you in 80 years it's a pretty good life it's a pretty good life

00:59:50.09 80 years I'd take 80 years guaranteed if that was something taking 80 years to

00:59:55.09 kill you like oxygen does that anything if that's a good point if I was playing

01:00:01.20 deal or no deal and the banker offered 80 years I would take 80 years

01:00:07.07 I'd be good with that for life for life yeah how long do you think you're going

01:00:11.23 to live oh my why don't you complain 8 a.m how long do you plan on living as

01:00:17.07 long as humanly possible I don't know there's factors yeah I'm gonna live

01:00:22.01 we've had this we used to have this talk

01:00:24.15 all the time back in the day Gavin wants to die someday I don't I want to live

01:00:28.08 forever I want to I want them to put my brain in something uh ted Williams style

01:00:32.15 and I upload my consciousness like that upload

01:00:36.05 show I want to be I want to live for [ __ ] ever and part of why I try so

01:00:42.02 hard uh at my career is so that I can amass enough money to buy immortality

01:00:47.07 someday and I'm not anywhere close by the way some people live so long they

01:00:50.23 watch their kids die of old age and I think that's tragic I don't think I

01:00:54.21 don't think that's how long a human should live what if I I would just

01:00:58.09 appreciate that if Millie lived one day longer than me now I wanted to

01:01:02.06 live forever times like plus whatever I don't want her to die a day after me I

01:01:04.10 don't want to die ever but I don't plan on outliving Millie I plan on her living

01:01:08.07 the same genetics she's going to live just as long as I will it reminds me of

01:01:12.01 why I don't want to live so long because I'm because I'm curious about

01:01:17.03 stuff I'm still enjoying life is still [ __ ] awesome dude yeah if you put in

01:01:46.14 it reminds me of Colin Quinn had a heart attack he's like 60 or whatever at this

01:01:51.04 point and he was like yeah I had a heart attack and I realized now I'm gonna die

01:01:55.12 like up until this point I was kind of on the fence if that was gonna happen to
