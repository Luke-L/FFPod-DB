00:00:15.11 Hello and welcome to another episode of the F**kFuckFacePodcast this is number 103

00:00:22.00 yes that's right 103

00:00:24.08 uh of season four year two volume one my name is Geoff Ramsey with

00:00:31.09 me as always Gavin free and Andrew panton uh hi guys hi hi how's it going

00:00:37.09 I'm doing really well this has been a fun week I've enjoyed seeing all the

00:00:42.19 anal passage

00:00:46.00 because I don't have the same uh I don't interact with jack all that much I

00:00:51.04 watched the rooster t podcast which jack was on on my eye and it felt

00:00:56.08 I know it wasn't scripted but the fact he wore that shirt felt scripted in the

00:01:02.07 best way but his eyes were so genuine that like there's no way that that was

00:01:07.12 done intentionally no I'll be honest with you

00:01:11.05 I I I was my [ __ ] I was trying to pick my jaw up off the ground from the

00:01:16.04 second he walked in to the studio because the idea that he would wear the

00:01:22.13 exact shirt during the middle of the joke about the

00:01:28.02 shirt and honestly the only intersection in in content where it would ever make

00:01:34.03 sense uh was in live in that moment it was such serendipity I immediately

00:01:38.16 thought nobody's gonna believe this no and it's such a shame nobody's going to

00:01:43.22 believe this but holy [ __ ] is this fortuitous and uh

00:01:47.21 but I think his cluelessness had to they absolutely did because I wasn't

00:01:52.00 I was one of those people like I didn't have the context of like if that would

00:01:55.12 have been organized or whatever I would have known so when I first saw it I

00:01:58.22 thought oh that's funny he's leaning into it and then his reactions were so

00:02:02.15 clear and just in case we didn't set up properly jack was on the rooster teeth

00:02:07.07 podcast with you guys on Monday and he was wearing the annual pass shirt that

00:02:11.06 we turned into an anal passage shirt based on what gavit said and he had zero

00:02:16.07 idea that the shirt had been for sale for four or five days at that yeah I sat

00:02:20.14 down next to him and I was like oh my god and I just was like nice shirt and

00:02:24.06 then he was like all right what's going on with the shirt and I was like no way

00:02:28.23 he doesn't know yeah it he it eluded him through social

00:02:33.01 media all weekend so comment leavers uh thank you for for not spoiling it yes

00:02:38.12 and uh regulation listeners well you just you did your job uh

00:02:42.19 as well I will say there are some snitches though and I saw

00:02:46.23 you because I promoted it on on the facepod twitter account but I deleted it

00:02:51.17 in 15 minutes I tweeted about it with a link retweeted it and liked it and was

00:02:55.11 like I'm going to delete this in 15

00:02:58.00 minutes and somebody immediately tagged him I was like ah

00:03:01.03 trying to ruin this joke so there are people I see you trying to snitch on it

00:03:06.08 no no I'm taking notes I'm taking they might

00:03:09.20 be on the list of 20000. Keeping a list I still got spaces to fill but I was

00:03:14.03 just so happy that that came together we improbably uh sold over a hundred of

00:03:20.00 those things which that's wonderful so ridiculous that's great oh man

00:03:24.11 so thank you to everybody who bought an anal passage shirt

00:03:29.07 that was part of a hilarious joke that honestly

00:03:33.07 honestly I think annoyed jack so that's what I was about to ask yeah have you

00:03:38.23 talked to jack about the shirt I assume he listens to the show that he would

00:03:43.01 have heard by now he he texted me well Gavin and I were at

00:03:47.01 dinner actually we went out to Gavin and I went out to dinner the other night

00:03:50.15 together with a bunch of old people who were really old and very old and we were

00:03:56.00 by far the coolest youngest people there and while I said you were like you were

00:03:59.23 like please sit next to me

00:04:03.16 that is a hundred percent true uh he just texted me and he said I'm

00:04:09.07 counting those shirt sales to annual pass I think that's fair

00:04:14.21 yeah that's fair totally fair official collab

00:04:20.23 he was definitely you could tell because I've been doing it for so very many

00:04:26.00 years you can tell when you genuinely get under his skin he's gotten a lot

00:04:30.08 better at hiding it he's built something he's built some armor up over the last

00:04:34.13 two decades but uh but we definitely we definitely uh annoyed him in all the

00:04:39.13 best ways all the best ways and it's a great shirt it's fantastic uh I I also

00:04:45.20 speaking of of texting people I got so last episode we recorded I I introduced

00:04:50.09 a game that we talked about guess who might be dead too everyone's favorite

00:04:54.06 game I was so happy the next day to have a

00:04:58.00 text from Gavin in which he said what did he say I wrote down I wrote that

00:05:02.09 quote he said in quotes guess who might be dead too may have been the greatest

00:05:07.07 game I've ever played I was very excited about that

00:05:10.02 I'm glad you enjoyed it well I was laughing at it because I thought about

00:05:14.21 it again afterwards and then uh when I was proofing it made me laugh again and

00:05:18.12 I was I just like that you referred to you refer to the crucifixion as a real

00:05:23.19 predicament I don't know that might be the most fair understated use of the

00:05:29.12 word predicament ever is it not a predicament

00:05:32.17 it's not an ideal situation to be in it's like yeah it's the predicament that

00:05:37.00 predicaments might be based off of honestly it could be it could be the

00:05:40.12 first predicament [Laughter]

00:05:43.22 the origin of the word is there

00:05:48.04 but the first predicament [Laughter]

00:06:02.13 the last supper leads into the first predicament oh my god

00:06:07.12 oh it was the calm before the predicament you made me a little bit there

00:06:12.13 god damn I did it's great I'm glad we went down that road I didn't expect

00:06:16.13 together but so I got that text from Gavin and I thought I'm so glad that he

00:06:20.05 enjoyed it but the people at home I'm sure they would want to play this

00:06:24.21 amazing game so I immediately reached out to the kind the kind guy

00:06:29.07 michael's games labs who made that that drop-down ian head game the knob drop

00:06:34.11 thing and we have a playable guess who might be dead too it is an

00:06:40.06 actual game you can play it I source movies at some friend source

00:06:44.21 scenes from movies he source movies we have like 50 or so movies at this point

00:06:50.12 uh let me know if you need a password to get into I need one so I will yeah yeah

00:06:54.23 I will I'll put the password in the chat so you guys can open this up and see it

00:06:58.20 will you gonna play live on the podcast you can absolutely play live as you

00:07:02.18 would like to um when people are listening maybe we'll

00:07:05.21 put a link to this game in the description of the chest that people can

00:07:09.07 easily find it and they will not need a password at this time I was just trying

00:07:12.10 to keep it hidden so it didn't somehow leak to you guys but it is a full game

00:07:16.06 it is a playable game and so just for context of how this game specifically

00:07:20.06 works it is the moment in which is being

00:07:23.15 displayed it's if the character dies in the movie later but lives in that moment

00:07:29.03 it will be lives even though they may die later so specifically the context of

00:07:34.21 the scene that is being displayed should we play now yeah absolutely oh my god

00:07:40.12 okay let's see so you click play and uh it tells you the movie as well as

00:07:45.11 the year released is it the same for everyone is it random

00:07:50.21 no no it's random it's a randomly cycling thing of images can I tell you

00:07:56.01 the first one I got I'd love to hear your first one it was the younglings

00:08:00.14 installers that's a great one I wish I could take

00:08:03.21 I wish I could take credit for that one that was the the the wonderful person

00:08:07.11 who made the game I didn't turn off the game because the music was too loud but

00:08:12.08 um I can't wait to play that later it's fantastic oh my god

00:08:16.16 Samuel Jackson in deep blue sea I think he lives

00:08:19.20 oh he does not play no that's that's like one of the most iconic death scenes

00:08:24.20 of die live gremlins oh billy lives of course oh no the younglings [Music]

00:08:33.12 the other guys sam Jackson in the wrong independence day

00:08:39.03 oh oh I guess he does die dude that's awesome yeah this day randy quaint

00:08:46.02 oh yeah yeah and he drives the whole thing and it's a

00:08:50.19 great scene I love that movie oh my god so that that was one of my I as soon as

00:08:56.03 you texted me that Gavin I immediately thought well can I make this a game I

00:08:59.09 don't know how to make games and I reached out to him and he loved it and

00:09:02.18 he put that together so quickly and over the like the last week we've been just

00:09:07.00 adding more movies to it and uh I'm excited to see people play it and react

00:09:12.15 to it so it's great what's crazy to me is um given our day job and our

00:09:17.14 association with the gaming industry right uh I had kind of

00:09:21.12 the dog's coughing uh I had kind of had a like unofficial uh thought in my head

00:09:26.17 that like a rule in my head though one of the things we would never be we might

00:09:30.12 be a bother podcast for a while we might be uh

00:09:33.08 a fruit podcast certainly an apple podcast maybe not a banana podcast

00:09:37.01 definitely we're a baseball podcast on occasion uh

00:09:41.12 we're certainly a beef a beefy podcast I I never wanted to be a gaming podcast

00:09:45.12 but we we might be a little bit in a way

00:09:48.23 that I did not anticipate which is we're a game creating part

00:09:53.14 well I guess yeah I love related direction

00:09:55.19 not to give us any we're like the Steve jobs but like way less talented like we

00:10:00.05 oh yeah the direction we have none of the skills we can't take any of the

00:10:05.12 credit we're just we we are just the turtleneck Porsche yes

00:10:09.09 Steve jobs not even the full shirt we're just the annoying part the ghost

00:10:15.00 that keeps it warmer than a neck needs to be in a climate-controlled

00:10:20.10 environment uh but here we are that's us we're providing useless warmth while

00:10:24.05 more talented people create the games absolutely yeah and I don't know it's

00:10:28.21 funny that you don't you didn't think of

00:10:30.21 us as ever being a gaming podcast not in a traditional sense but games is just

00:10:36.02 such a big part of at least my life yeah I guess so

00:10:38.11 they don't come up as much you're jem's the war guy come on are you at least you

00:10:42.23 used to be yeah but yeah no no I'm still a jim's award guy but I'm certainly not

00:10:46.23 talking about it on the podcast can you imagine a gems of war podcast

00:10:52.03 everywhere I cannot it would be [Music]

00:10:54.05 it would be I don't know who would be more torturous for the the three people

00:10:58.12 that listen to it or the person who has to do it oh man

00:11:02.09 that'll be when I hit rock bottom I'll do a jim's award podcast yeah yeah

00:11:07.14 I'm excited I didn't even know what that would look

00:11:10.17 like I don't know yeah I wonder how long

00:11:13.07 you could talk for before you would just have nothing to say

00:11:17.16 I well I'll tell you what I I I I rarely listen to this podcast but I

00:11:22.06 listen to myself talk ad nauseum without taking a breath for

00:11:25.15 the first 14 [ __ ] minutes the last episode just talking about baseballs in

00:11:30.23 a store issue so I could probably go for a while I had to have nick

00:11:35.08 I said 14 you guys only had to listen to 11 minutes because I made nick cut it

00:11:38.19 down even more are you talking to the audience to the audience yeah yeah I

00:11:43.18 listened to the pre the pre-dentist version Jesus Christ so

00:11:47.00 I could probably talk about gems of war for a couple days

00:11:52.02 oh man speaking of uh talking about stuff I uh oh what

00:11:57.14 that doesn't need a segment yeah that's a great segue speaking of talking

00:12:02.17 about stuff I uh I have not had a lot prepared for this

00:12:06.19 podcast for the last few weeks um outside of the tattoo which was kind of

00:12:10.04 a visual gag and I've been feeling kind of bad about

00:12:12.19 it and whenever that happens typically I I go and uh I'll just devote like a day

00:12:18.02 or two days to just like brainstorming and trying to come up with [ __ ]

00:12:21.08 um but I've been so busy with other creative work the last couple weeks for

00:12:25.21 the company um pitching some shows to the achievement hunter guys and some

00:12:30.15 other stuff going on and I just haven't been able to

00:12:34.00 to devote the time to it and so I realized

00:12:36.06 after I uh after lunch today after I ran some errands I was like oh [ __ ] I've

00:12:39.16 gotta do a podcast with these guys in two weeks in two hours and I haven't

00:12:43.08 really contributed to anything in two weeks I better get my [ __ ] together what

00:12:47.06 do I do so I thought I'm gonna get on my bicycle cause that's where I have my

00:12:50.13 best ideas and I'm just gonna ride around and I'm just gonna come up with

00:12:54.04 ideas on my bicycle and then I'll have a bunch of ideas and

00:12:58.04 so I did that and so I have on my phone a bunch of notes of thoughts I had while

00:13:03.00 riding my bicycle trying to come up with

00:13:06.10 ideas for this podcast today if you guys want to how many thoughts did you have

00:13:12.00 let me hold on let me look it up here uh how long did you ride I read for one

00:13:17.05 hour okay uh about 10.9 miles is what I wrote I bet you had

00:13:20.12 six thoughts I was thinking the same I had six thoughts I thought every ten

00:13:24.19 minutes yeah it's a good average yeah yeah first thought uh wouldn't it be fun

00:13:30.13 if we all had a contest to see if we could work out one muscle

00:13:34.09 and then see if you can get inordinately big in that like one like your right

00:13:38.10 calf or like your left bicep kind of like

00:13:41.19 that character in that uh what lady in the water movie who had the big one one

00:13:45.22 big strong arm or like all the German people who uh do arm wrestling that only

00:13:50.05 work out their their one to church yeah oh like a charger from like from left

00:13:55.16 to gaming yeah great example uh but it doesn't have to be an arm one ab

00:14:00.23 yeah like could you do an ab could you do like I just want to have the world's

00:14:05.22 strongest neck you know I'm just gonna do neck exercises or like

00:14:10.15 I want a big juicy booty but everything else looks exactly as it does now so I'm

00:14:16.04 just gonna do squats yeah Andrew should absolutely do ankle

00:14:19.11 exercises like you should have you should have like you should have like Arnold

00:14:23.20 Schwarzenegger ankles I am going a different direction with it I would love

00:14:28.03 to have an absurdly strong pinky just something that doesn't need to be but I

00:14:32.14 could like it's a weird it'd be a weird flex

00:14:35.14 if the pinky was jacked I don't think I've ever seen a jacked finger before I

00:14:39.17 don't know if that's even possible I'm sure if you worked at it odd enough

00:14:43.09 you could jack your finger pretty hard isn't it mostly tendons though instead

00:14:48.00 of your box what's how much do you think I could lift with just my

00:14:52.14 my pinky currently um well I think you should test the

00:14:56.10 force that it would take to pull it out of the socket and then uh slightly

00:15:02.10 how do I test that I don't know well you're awesome pinky because you

00:15:07.08 might not be able to use it anymore you don't want to do that to your good pinky

00:15:11.11 I don't think I need my pinky really I think the pinky is a overrated finger I

00:15:14.12 know I don't think it's rated that highly you think that you get

00:15:18.08 superfluous what are you going to balance your phone on without a pinky

00:15:22.02 you would work around let's say okay if there was like an about when you drink

00:15:27.20 what about when you drink tea yeah I I hate I'm I'm my pinky always

00:15:31.10 goes up and I hate it it's just it happens I hate that it always I have to

00:15:34.19 catch myself be drinking glass of water pinkie up just always happy so I'd be

00:15:40.06 okay if I lost my pinkies I think if there was like an nfl style draft seven

00:15:46.10 rounds and if people picked body parts I think the pinky is like the punter of

00:15:50.13 the body like it's a seventh round pick it's you probably you would pick that

00:15:54.12 before you'd like pick your appendix before your pinky oh 100

00:15:58.12 absolutely I don't fully understand what my appendix does

00:16:03.05 I know what my pinky is capable of doing I don't think I need it your appendix

00:16:08.12 there's a there's like a 40 chance that at at some point in your life your

00:16:12.02 appendix will try to kill you yes your opinion that's what will never harm you

00:16:16.00 whatever I've spent most of my life whenever I'd hear the term appendix

00:16:19.16 bursting in my head it was always like a

00:16:21.22 chess burster that like it would explode

00:16:24.11 like a grenade yeah I assume that that's correct I don't think it is have you

00:16:28.19 ever had your appendix out I have not but internally like I'm saying visually

00:16:33.18 in my head it was like suit and exploding there it could be Andrew

00:16:37.06 here's the problem when everybody's tummy hurts they go to the doctor and

00:16:40.14 they get their appendix removed you never hear about people whose appendix

00:16:43.21 explode because they put the pin in the grenade before before the detonation

00:16:49.03 but for all we know that could be that could

00:16:52.23 be why it's such a big goddamn deal to get somebody to the hospital because

00:16:57.12 what if it's like it's so dangerous that if you were in

00:17:01.03 the proximity of somebody's tummy you could get shrapnel

00:17:05.03 like we might have a whole like it might

00:17:08.10 be a whole thing because it's so goddamn dangerous

00:17:10.15 uh that people take it so seriously there's a scene in an ambulance

00:17:14.12 involving a spleen that you'd probably need to see it it's on streaming now I

00:17:18.01 need to I need this is it really all right from home yeah it's already like

00:17:21.01 you can paint and rent it I need to do that

00:17:23.12 I really think I like I was thinking what else I I don't respect wisdom teeth

00:17:27.20 probably don't need but I view those as like spare tires

00:17:31.05 so I guess I take I do I would take those over the pinky

00:17:34.11 I really think the pinky would be the last thing I would take you would rather

00:17:38.23 remove something you only have 10 off than something you have 32 of

00:17:42.12 yeah because I just don't maybe you know what maybe I will try a

00:17:46.00 week where I don't use my my pinkies at all and just see what that's like yeah

00:17:49.23 yeah maybe I'm greatly I'm not really that with the pinky potentially shopping

00:17:54.17 from the end caps as well yeah no no pinky no peeky in cap week okay

00:17:59.12 I could do that here here's my second idea oh I forgot something so I was I was

00:18:05.20 I was writing down you know mostly through neighborhoods but I was looking

00:18:09.10 for stuff to be inspired by but pretty much all I saw was was well you'll see

00:18:13.09 pretty much all I saw was houses and [ __ ] right so I got to thinking about

00:18:17.07 reality tv and where we would make our the best impact as a reality tv show and

00:18:21.22 then it hit me we should flip houses together like what if we were the property

00:18:27.05 brothers or the or the flipper flops or like I'm

00:18:30.13 Christine on the coast and you're her ex-husband or whatever uh

00:18:36.04 yeah we I would like to see us with the tool belts doing some damage fixing some

00:18:41.07 [ __ ] up making some dreams come true that was

00:18:44.21 all that was I would like to build because Andrew seems to bend his life to

00:18:49.10 fit him as much as possible like putting keurigs in the bedroom and you know

00:18:53.16 putting cereal in the toilet or whatever you do what I would love to build a

00:18:57.10 house from scratch that is exactly to your specifications yes it'd be sort of

00:19:02.03 like that like andrew's version of the house of the future like you would see

00:19:05.19 like in the 40s and the 50s they would build those model homes with all the

00:19:09.13 like like near future technology that was going to make your life so much

00:19:13.03 easier and it was all [ __ ] like I would love to see that ver like if Andrew

00:19:17.12 designed a home from the ground up to be the perfect future proof Andrew home

00:19:21.16 it's so funny you say that because I had this thought literally the other day

00:19:25.01 where I was wishing that there was some I think it was I don't

00:19:28.00 even remember what it was maybe in my washing machine I was like ah why do I

00:19:31.21 have to go to a different room just for that like that would be so handy it

00:19:35.07 should be in my closet so like when I change clothes I immediately just put

00:19:39.20 the old clothes in to be washed and then I realized that if

00:19:44.10 I built things under that that that vision

00:19:47.01 I would have an entire empty space of nothing everything would be in one space

00:19:51.20 and then the rest of the entire house would just be empty and that's a [ __ ]

00:19:55.15 house I think it's a terrible idea I don't even think my vision is good like

00:19:59.08 that would I would not I would be miserable I just have so much wasted

00:20:03.01 space I thought something similar I was like why aren't all kitchen cabinets

00:20:07.16 dishwashers like you could just move [ __ ] between them absolutely

00:20:11.12 it's funny you say that because another pot I can't take credit for this this is

00:20:15.02 from another comedy podcast that I heard months and months ago but it's been

00:20:18.13 sticking to my head the whole time somebody said why not have two

00:20:22.04 dishwashers yeah yeah yeah some people do that and they just move from one to

00:20:25.03 the other yeah you just move stuff from one to the other and then you never it's

00:20:29.03 it's a perfect cycle right it makes so much sense we should absolutely I wish I

00:20:32.12 wish I had two that's a pretty pricey way to not use

00:20:35.09 kitchen cabinets though pretty pricey and then also a waste of cabinets

00:20:40.10 I didn't this is the problem if you and I design houses I it's funny because I

00:20:44.05 just it was right before we we recorded I put this in my notes I had this for a

00:20:48.12 while um this is a friend of mine's door and I

00:20:52.03 was gonna ask you Gavin if this is like an overseas thing or if this is just

00:20:57.22 like if we made a house so this worked look at these doors

00:21:00.19 one is way too large and the other one is too big and it just makes me

00:21:04.21 uncomfortable why is the handle why is the handle

00:21:08.04 eighty percent up the door I don't know it's it's chest level

00:21:12.04 I don't like this that's so high up like that's a long door I feel like that has

00:21:17.22 no sense of scale like that looks like a really tall what is that like an

00:21:21.16 Australian plug where is this what's going on new Zealand it's a new Zealand

00:21:25.11 home um but I just I didn't know what's in the little demon cubby up top

00:21:31.07 it just goes to the top of the house there's no there's no like it's just the

00:21:36.07 the construction of it it's like wooden space it's like a crawl space but not at

00:21:40.12 all developed that I don't know why that door that's where the map lives it does

00:21:45.01 that's what I felt I felt like it was a demon door but also it's just the other

00:21:48.23 doors way too long like I feel like that would be us we just don't know how to

00:21:53.05 measure things I love this that would be this is the perfect location for a

00:21:57.07 Jackie chan chase to end up because

00:22:07.18 he would grab the top of it and like swing in with his legs like he'd kick

00:22:13.00 out like I could see it so clearly that is a Jackie chan door

00:22:16.23 oh do you think Jackie chan just has those size doors in his home to escape

00:22:22.05 from people gets into an argue with someone there's

00:22:25.12 no following him I couldn't if you were a storm chaser like me

00:22:30.06 you could not I could not pursue Jackie chan if you don't know oh god there's no

00:22:35.05 way it'd be preventative well you gotta go get a stepladder

00:22:39.20 his house must be a labyrinth of like ladders and slides

00:22:43.11 that Winchester fireman pulls yeah it's like that's

00:22:50.10 oh oh that's good I I think if I was to build you a house Andrew

00:22:55.09 my first modification to like making it not like a normal house is that the

00:23:00.13 floor of the bedroom would be a lift and you would be able to descend or

00:23:06.12 yes you have to go to any floor via the bed if you want to wake up in the

00:23:11.07 elevator yes the bed the bed isn't the bed is the

00:23:14.22 elevator yeah and your alarm could be like it just drops a little scares the

00:23:19.09 [ __ ] out of you wakes you up you lean over you've got your you got

00:23:24.04 your noodles or whatever your chow mein [Laughter]

00:23:29.01 I love the idea of there being a two one-story house like you think it's a

00:23:33.16 one-story house and literally an entire floor

00:23:39.16 and then you're just down in the kitchen and people like why is there this big

00:23:45.01 open square where there's nothing inside and you're like don't worry about it

00:23:49.02 I want a house like the building in control you know how like rooms are

00:23:52.18 constantly shifting like I just that would be ideal that'd be fun

00:23:56.13 my bedroom is in the front of the home suddenly

00:23:59.18 I don't know where my bathroom is it's on a different level now constant shift

00:24:03.20 oh Christ so what's idea three Geoff oh sure uh remember I was driving through

00:24:08.02 neighborhoods looking at houses because it was all that was around and I was

00:24:11.10 trying to be safe uh you guys you guys know what I think must work really well

00:24:16.11 political signs you ever notice that you see political signs everywhere in

00:24:21.09 people's yards all out front like uh at a at like a

00:24:25.07 busy intersection anywhere there's a grass a little plop plot of land there's

00:24:30.08 400 political signs and they say like well I saw one today that said vote for

00:24:35.16 prop a I have no idea if prop a is good or bad I'm not keeping up right now but

00:24:40.13 that got me thinking if we're trying to get the word out what better way than

00:24:46.12 we make political signs for face that are like vote for prop f

00:24:51.12 yeah it's like face and then people can put them in their yard all over america

00:24:56.02 and they're like and on you know like when you drive by the church on like uh

00:24:59.21 on you know voting on Tuesday morning and it's like all the vote here vote uh

00:25:03.06 key signs and there's all the different like props and you know vote for this

00:25:06.22 person and all the you know this person for mayor this person for county

00:25:10.04 commissioner railroad commissioner governor whatever and then there's just

00:25:13.18 like a bunch of vote for prop f prop f people will be wandering around thinking

00:25:17.17 uh realizing well I see a very strong correlation between people who want prop

00:25:22.00 f and people who really don't want you to scrump it seems to be such a hero.

00:25:26.13 [Laughter]

00:25:27.18 Wonder what's

00:25:34.06 you think that or do you think it's like decriminalizing scrumping

00:25:39.08 yeah something decriminalizing scrumping yeah apple free apples free people yeah

00:25:44.17 there you go I always feel so dumb when I read free world [Laughter]

00:25:50.06 vote yes on prop f I always feel so stupid when I see

00:25:54.12 something a lot and I don't know what it stands for or what it means like the

00:25:59.06 prop a stuff and for a while in in Austin there was I saw so many signs

00:26:03.14 that said stop the pud and I don't know what pud is or what I don't know if they

00:26:08.00 stopped it it just always annoys me when I see an

00:26:11.20 abbreviation or like an acronym so many times without ever be I'm always

00:26:15.16 too lazy to Google it and I never figure

00:26:17.17 out what it is just by thinking about it

00:26:19.15 like like the other day I was looking at some baseball stuff and I couldn't

00:26:23.10 figure out what rbi stood for and it was

00:26:25.06 just annoying the [ __ ] out of me I was like why is that not obvious to me what

00:26:28.23 that is batted in rbi it's how many points you scored like

00:26:32.17 you personally I didn't just say points because they're called runs no

00:26:38.06 I want to just say runs yeah runs batted

00:26:40.13 in like how many run like like like if I if you're on first base and I and I'm

00:26:44.12 batting we're on the same team and I hit a home run then I just got two rbis I

00:26:48.23 got two runs bedded in and they count against the pitcher and they count for

00:26:53.07 us okay I didn't know how that worked that makes sense

00:26:57.05 yeah it's cute so does the person so it's like a stat against pitchers then

00:27:02.00 not what's a stat against pitchers and it's a stat four

00:27:05.09 if I'm on first base do I get anything for that yeah you get a run scored you

00:27:09.14 get a run scored okay I got it but I don't get an rbi because I I wasn't I

00:27:13.08 didn't you didn't bat the running you just you scored it yeah so you counsel

00:27:17.07 the run scored and then rbi two rbis for

00:27:20.06 the batter so why if you're on first why wouldn't it be called r ri run

00:27:24.23 runs run it runs ran in well let's petition for for that change

00:27:29.18 to be made that'd be impromptu that'd be that's that's the that's the prop f uh

00:27:35.01 subsection 1a yeah this is this changing runs

00:27:39.16 to change it to runs ran in yeah what's the name of that symbol you always see

00:27:44.16 in legal stuff like the squiggly like s with a circle in the middle of it it's

00:27:49.03 a squiggly s with a circle in it I immediately thought to like the logo

00:27:53.00 of the young and the restless when you said that I know that's not accurate

00:27:56.12 like that squiggly like thing that's where my brain immediately went I have

00:28:02.06 no idea what you're talking about oh man post it

00:28:05.06 is that just a y and r the squiggly young and restless thing that's the

00:28:08.20 thing that like I I can see in my head I don't know what that is I don't think

00:28:12.04 this is a character you guys know what I'm talking about no

00:28:17.00 young and restless squiggly smoothly this is not where I thought political

00:28:22.10 signs would oh this is here I'll just post this this is

00:28:26.11 absolutely what I was thinking of when you said the script it is just a y n r

00:28:30.06 I've never really paid attention to what it is

00:28:32.10 but it's just a bunch of squealing lines in my head oh yeah it's the younger the

00:28:37.03 yr yeah the yr yeah but just quickly I don't think that's some chord

00:28:42.13 documents I looked up my squiggle uh and it means section

00:28:45.19 section okay can you show what the squiggle looks like can you can I see

00:28:50.19 what the what the squiggle is I don't think I even know it's

00:28:53.12 what do you mean yeah it's he put he texted it it's in the discord chat oh I

00:28:58.08 didn't even see that I've never seen that in my life oh we should make what

00:29:01.20 is it called again section we should make section shirts

00:29:05.20 you should all get section tattoos [Applause]

00:29:12.04 this podcast is sponsored by better help life can be overwhelming and many people

00:29:17.01 are burned out without even knowing it symptoms can include lack of motivation

00:29:20.19 feeling helpless or trapped detachment fatigue and more I know with my burnout

00:29:25.12 it's typically feelings of being very detached and overwhelmed and just a

00:29:30.00 general struggle to accomplish tasks that typically aren't that difficult for

00:29:34.12 me or just feeling pressure for not being able to do things that I'd like to

00:29:38.20 do but I just am so maxed out that I have to kind of disconnect from a lot of

00:29:43.01 things I may not necessarily want to we associate burnout with work but that's

00:29:47.01 not the only cause any of our roles in life can lead us to feeling burnt out

00:33:39.05 code face so what's what's the next next idea Geoff oh uh so well building

00:33:45.22 off of that and this isn't anything I saw that well I saw with my brain eye uh

00:33:51.17 so I guess internally I saw it uh but that got me thinking about getting the

00:33:55.01 word out about prop f and just about creative ways to get the word out and

00:33:58.12 please remember I was in a neighborhood so while I was looking at were houses

00:34:02.04 and trees and that got me thinking about trees and how we could use trees more

00:34:05.18 our benefit and that that got me thinking about like 20 years ago in

00:34:09.15 Germany when they realized that [ __ ]

00:34:13.03 Hitler uh like in the 40s planted a bunch of trees in the forest in a

00:34:16.18 swastika pattern so like 40 years later when they bloomed and they came in in

00:34:20.10 the fall you see a bunch of swastikas in

00:34:23.07 the landscape from aerial views and that

00:34:26.08 got me thinking uh what? We should make uh

00:34:29.01 we should make giant ian tree sculptures in forests that you can only see from

00:34:32.03 above and you won't be able to see for 50 years I I need to vote against prop f

00:34:36.18 now um [Laughter]

00:34:39.04 probably less of the Nazi inspired aerial ah I don't why no I'm not in that

00:34:43.18 I don't know why did you make that connection you could have just explained

00:34:47.23 it without tying it to Hitler why would why would that's where that way that's

00:34:51.23 where I got the idea well I got the idea from Reddit but that's where I saw it

00:34:57.09 posted no you can't we can't Geoff we can't do an idea that was from Hitler we

00:35:01.04 can't say inspired by with Hitler that's terrible I'm not saying it was I know

00:35:05.18 you're right about that I don't want to say you just did literally a musician

00:35:11.07 plagiarizes another artist and then like retroactively gives the writing credit

00:35:16.13 to the original I don't I don't want to give any credit to Nazis I just think it

00:35:22.21 would be cool to make a tree to make some sort of a design in the trees

00:35:27.18 we can't do it

00:35:42.08 and nobody's questioning that nobody's saying it's just

00:35:46.02 why did you do that well that's where the I that's what but that's what made

00:35:51.03 me think of it it was like are those [ __ ] because they they use they use

00:35:55.07 trees for the power of bad and I want to

00:35:57.10 take it back and use trees for the power of good

00:36:00.08 to be fair they probably they probably took that idea from someone else yeah

00:36:03.20 they don't invent [ __ ] they stole [ __ ]

00:36:05.18 Right almost certainly just a weird comparable like once it reminds me of

00:36:10.10 when you did the coin thing with the coin imagine the coin like you didn't

00:36:14.15 you could have just said what it was you

00:36:17.01 didn't need to give context to where the idea maybe I think I think context is

00:36:21.03 always important for that

00:36:25.11 just so we're clear it would be an ian logo or the face logo

00:36:30.13 but that is not the thing that was the problem we all get it the ian logo is

00:36:36.12 great you're just sourcing it it's terrible so

00:36:40.12 I'm sensing a pattern here with Geoff's it was just writing thoughts I'm gonna

00:36:45.12 guess that um thought number five was about a road and

00:36:49.16 I thought number six was about the sky and then I think it was a lot of ideas

00:36:55.08 thought number five thought number five was building off of the ian trees

00:37:00.23 no that got me thinking about other ways of non-traditionally promoting things

00:37:06.14 from aerial views and that got me thinking if we owned a farm like a corn

00:37:11.19 or a wheat farm uh I don't have one but maybe we could pool our money together

00:37:15.11 and get one uniform there you go uh we could do crop circles we could do I bet

00:37:21.01 no one has ever done an ian crop circle before yeah

00:37:25.07 like you could only see it from a from a low-lying plane oh from a low-flying

00:37:29.12 plane which you want to credit genghis khan with the creation of the crop

00:37:32.16 circle like how do you want to lead into this crop circle concepts well I I

00:37:38.00 didn't get to it through genghis khan I got to the crop circle through the

00:37:42.08 entries which I got to from the swastika thing

00:37:45.20 if you want me to follow it all the way back I can the genghis khan was never a

00:37:49.14 part of that uh it came from the tree idea I had the number four on the bullet

00:37:54.05 list uh anyway I think a giant ian crop circle would be quite fun to make and

00:37:59.11 could be very clever yeah as long as we rent someone's crops

00:38:03.11 yeah do you have crops are you a regulation listener or a comet leaver in

00:38:07.12 possession of a large field of crop would you mind if we came in the middle

00:38:12.10 of the night while you're asleep and pretended to be aliens with a long board

00:38:17.22 on some string and we flattened just a little bit just a little of your crops

00:38:21.16 and it's it to make a standard head uh ears where they go nose up top that's

00:38:27.16 all we gotta do is that they do it with a plank

00:38:30.15 yeah that's one of the ways to do it for sure yeah there's there's a couple

00:38:34.10 different ways just imagining we'd make a big like a big stamp

00:38:38.14 just lower it down yeah I like that method or like a zamboni

00:38:42.12 like machine for crop circles

00:38:51.18 my final idea has nothing to do with crop circles or trees or planting any of

00:38:56.19 the any of that stuff honestly it was actually my first idea but I pushed it

00:39:00.22 to the last because I thought it was the weakest and I wasn't sure we'd get

00:39:04.04 through them all but uh my first one was just it was just an observation that my

00:39:08.02 notes are a mess just an absolute mess Gavin showed me his face notes the other

00:39:12.17 night at dinner when we were at dinner with all those old old old people and uh

00:39:18.15 his notes are first off many he has hundreds of notes and they

00:39:23.02 all seem to make total sense my notes like they're all section to face my

00:39:28.02 notes are like it'll go like face note face note uh the dimensions of a dresser

00:39:33.17 uh shopping list for for lows uh face note from

00:39:37.11 ideas from yeah ideas for a mine craft series social really social security no

00:39:42.17 no uh phone number that I need to remember for

00:39:46.19 the chiropractor yeah it's just like and then face note some

00:39:50.08 and as I was even writing these notes I was looking at them and I was like I was

00:39:53.20 reminded I was like oh well here's your first note buddy you suck at notes and

00:39:57.12 then and I should bring up how Gavin has really really lovely notes I mean

00:40:02.13 they're at least all organized but it doesn't help me remember what they mean

00:40:06.17 like I would say 50 of them have been mentioned and the other 50 I wrote them

00:40:10.16 down and lost the connection with what they actually mean pull some up see if

00:40:15.09 we can figure it out decipher it I I recently got a a new printer because

00:40:21.01 here's my goal in life is um to have a printer right that if you leave it for

00:40:27.01 you know two weeks or more and then try to use it again

00:40:29.23 it prints that would be a great idea for

00:40:32.00 every revolutionary I wish there was one that did that but I got a new printer

00:40:35.11 that has air print what is air print you just print from an iPhone just without

00:40:40.12 having to install anything how does it how does that work so far uh it's worked

00:40:44.19 once I tested it by printing my face note and when you see all that stuff

00:40:49.12 printed onto paper and it's physically in front of you on several pages it

00:40:54.17 looks like the ramblings of a freaking lunatic let's see if we can

00:40:58.10 decipher some of these because I can't remember what I've talked about and what

00:41:02.02 I've forgotten by the way as you're looking can I just

00:41:06.07 say you hit on one of the greatest frustrations of my life which is the

00:41:10.23 fact that it's 2022 and printer technology still exists somewhere in

00:41:15.22 2006. Yeah yeah if I if I'm not making like if I if I look at my printer and

00:41:20.21 then look away and look back it stops like my printer requires eye contact

00:41:26.13 it's such [ __ ] [ __ ] and Millie needs to print something once a month

00:41:31.13 and every time I have to end up unplugging the printer which is like

00:41:35.10 shoved into a coin into one of my shelves so I got to like rip it out of

00:41:37.14 the shelf and unplug it for a while and plug it back in and then put it in and

00:41:41.00 then maybe it'll work but I might have to unplug it as many as three times just

00:41:45.16 to get it to do the one thing that it's supposed to do sorry I just it is must

00:41:49.21 be some biggest pet peeves it's like quantum rules involved that we don't

00:41:54.13 understand that observing it sort of affects how it performs

00:41:59.03 french lifeguard mad that I didn't interrupt him

00:42:03.01 french lifeguard okay well when were you last near a lifeguard I don't know

00:42:08.04 when were you last in France I don't it doesn't matter he doesn't

00:42:12.23 necessarily have to be in France a hitman game where you just have to

00:42:18.18 place 47 [ __ ]

00:42:20.04 oh I think I can kind of decipher that flowers could have been manly.

00:42:28.21 I'm sure that was just like like a tradition thing where it's just

00:42:33.09 like there's probably a universe where flowers are like a real bloke thing yeah

00:42:39.00 women don't like dudes yeah and it's just but someone at some point decided

00:42:44.13 flowers were more feminine classically and then that's stuck I like the idea of

00:42:49.04 incorporating sneaker culture to flowers I mean like you see those [ __ ] roses

00:42:53.12 holy [ __ ] somebody coming over to hang out with Megan like where's Gavin I

00:42:56.11 thought he was home today and she's like he's in the garage playing with his

00:43:01.03 tools I finally understand the geographical importance of moving from Philly to

00:43:07.15 Beverly hills.

00:43:12.12 I was like I think I was just like one wheeling around and I was like

00:43:17.11 oh that's actually quite a big move that's like

00:43:21.05 thousands of miles but as living as a kid in england and not understanding

00:43:26.21 that those two places could actually be far apart because my country is very

00:43:31.14 small in comparison you can just drive anywhere in a day

00:43:35.05 it suddenly just hit me as I was like bopping along to it in my head I was

00:43:38.11 like oh damn that's fine.

00:43:45.05 Philadelphia which was uh sort of a roughshod neighborhood at the time and

00:43:50.08 all of the information is provided in the intro of the show yeah I just never

00:43:55.10 picked up on all those queues of like oh that's the concept

00:43:59.08 was the song too good for you to understand the premise of it like it's a

00:44:03.05 rare case where the intro song was like you're just like this is a [ __ ]

00:44:07.05 banger I I think it's one of those things where you hear it as a kid and you

00:44:11.13 you know the words but you don't listen to the words it's kind of like the uh

00:44:15.09 the problem I had with a galaxy far far away it's like it had gone in but I'd

00:44:19.01 never listened to it yeah and I never watched the fresh prince I just knew

00:44:24.02 I just knew the intro so I didn't I didn't I also didn't get those clues

00:44:27.14 from watching the show I see do you do you have ever or like maybe when you

00:44:33.05 were a kid or you were in england around English people who speak with English

00:44:36.21 accents do you ever listen to like American music or like like say like

00:44:40.23 that song and have trouble understanding

00:44:43.03 the words because of American accents uh no because I grew up watching American

00:44:47.20 tv so I guess yeah desensitization yeah I grew up on you know Sabrina the

00:44:53.13 teenage witch and Keaton and cow so pretty the Keenan streak continues

00:44:58.13 because I I was just doing like the 10th mention

00:45:02.15 goddamn I was just in London for a week and uh I'd say about 15 percent of the

00:45:07.16 British people I still can't understand oh really just walking down the street

00:45:11.11 it's interesting you'll hear some people talking to you like whoa

00:45:15.06 that's funny yeah you do an impression uh yeah it's like the impression I the

00:45:19.17 one I used to use to make fun of dan it's like that

00:45:23.05 I don't know if I'm up for it right now I remember.

00:45:27.14 I thought it'd be a fun idea one day and I and I added a few um spaces

00:45:32.21 after I after episode 100 came out so I'm now on like a

00:45:36.15 a separate set of notes below that but I thought it'd be really fun to one day

00:45:41.11 just print the list and uh like give it away give it to charity or

00:45:45.00 something or like auction it for a like sign it and auction it for extra life or

00:45:48.02 something because it's just bizarre ramblings and uh even I don't know

00:45:50.23 whether it's fantastic what if you print

00:45:52.18 out a hundred will staple them print how

00:45:55.22 many pages is it uh it was up to episode 100 it was four pages of normal all

00:45:59.10 right so so we'll we'll print uh a hundred of each then we'll we'll staple

00:46:04.13 them and then we'll hit them all with baseball bats it's like a notary

00:46:10.04 we're gonna notarize them notarized rambling

00:46:17.11 I could hit it with the gold foil ian stamp do you have a list Andrew that's

00:46:23.07 constantly being added to are you just like separate notes sort of guy I I sort

00:46:28.16 of I delete so I write a bunch of things if I have a bigger thing I've planned

00:46:32.20 this is sort of in my head but when I I sit down typically the night before and

00:46:36.22 write down all the ideas that I remember talking about put them in a list and

00:46:40.14 then I'll delete them as we talk about them as we record so I don't have an

00:46:45.05 ongoing list I should huh I regret not having that be interesting to go back

00:46:48.14 and see like where different things were

00:46:49.09 or sometimes you know like you'll have a thing on a list that you plan on using

00:46:52.20 and then just doesn't come up so it'll just be on there for multiple weeks

00:46:56.19 all right yeah I delete and go I will say I love

00:47:00.13 your I'm going back to one of the concepts we didn't decipher the hitman thing

00:47:04.14 I think what that is is in hitman you have unlimited inventory for certain

00:47:08.23 items and the premise of like after he's done

00:47:13.03 a job he has 27 bottles of vodka in his suit

00:47:16.15 six rubber ducks nine knives like I think that that might be like the

00:47:20.08 absurdity of those games where like when

00:47:22.04 you finish if you think about the weight of those items and just trying to

00:47:25.19 maneuver with them it's hilarious it's a very funny premise I think it was just

00:47:30.15 that you can you can have a weapon stash and then

00:47:33.12 you'll go into like a bathroom or like a stock room and there'll be a freaking

00:47:36.18 giant sniper rifle in there or something

00:47:38.23 and that'd be an interesting part of the

00:47:41.22 game to have to be the person who either goes ahead of 47

00:47:45.14 who clears up after him would be like a funny concept for dlc or something

00:47:49.10 because in in the older games if you left stuff behind if you left like your

00:47:53.21 suit it would cost you because you'd they'd have to send people into yes go

00:47:56.23 and pick it up if you'd like the weapon on the floor yeah so basically be like

00:48:01.18 the hitman clean up crew yeah yeah I like that great idea you

00:48:05.02 just go in with a mop I was just thinking more like the the

00:48:08.12 reverse side of that of you know like the concept of coming home from work and

00:48:11.22 like getting out of your work clothes like 47 having to do that and pull the

00:48:16.09 seven ducks he has in his pocket out like just the annoyance of like what his

00:48:21.22 work brings yeah just six muffins yeah five burgers like it's just the most

00:48:26.19 dumb stuff it'd be heavy that'd be a funny if if I

00:48:30.20 uh use tick tock or something that'd be a funny uh just be like dressed as 47

00:48:35.02 walking into a room and just like throwing stuff on the floor or on the

00:48:38.12 bed it's like a vr game in my head of like you have to lift up your jacket and

00:48:42.20 just like physically remove all of the [ __ ] that you brought with you

00:48:47.09 that'd be a funny little short to film of like him wife like in bed in like a

00:48:51.20 king-sized bed with like fluffy pillows everywhere like a floral print duvet and

00:48:56.08 she's like reading of like she's like reading a better housekeeping or like a

00:48:59.19 vogue magazine like like a copy of the new yorker and then her husband comes in

00:49:03.10 and he's like taking his and she's like long day and he's like the usual and

00:49:06.21 then just starts emptying his pockets and the coffee unlike the dresser you

00:49:10.12 know yeah so I could watch pin billfold you know some paper clips

00:49:16.10 uh then it's like the little like piano wire that you slip throats with and then

00:49:22.10 the ducks and then a sniper rifle and just keeps piling up 19 key cards yeah I

00:49:26.14 I would love to submit that to Matt bragg for like a challenge accepted like

00:49:30.18 a weird episode where you just have to like walk into the bank level of hitman

00:49:35.15 2 or something pick up as much [ __ I as possible and then see if you can hold

00:49:39.05 all that stuff in real life I like that plays you always hear about

00:49:42.16 with women's clothes their lack of pockets like the obnoxious thing that he

00:49:46.12 has so many [ __ ] pockets well that was what I was trying to solve with the

00:49:50.09 wrist pocket right was to add a pocket on the body because women's clothes are

00:49:54.08 [ __ ] uh you know we actually did something similar to this Gavin way way

00:49:59.18 way way back in the early in the early aughts probably around 2009-2010

00:50:04.09 uh for immersion that series we used to do where we attempted uh well then you

00:50:08.11 did it after I stopped uh you did the next iteration of it where you try video

00:50:13.01 game principles in real life to see how they work and we had uh all of the

00:50:16.19 weapons you would carry with you in doom that you had to carry on your body and

00:50:20.19 see how you could traverse the battlefield oh yeah yeah it was that the

00:50:24.14 one with an explosion in it yeah I think so I think it had an explosion and we

00:50:29.16 had like 80 pounds of or like 800 pounds of guns on her around and you were

00:50:33.11 locked in a car laughing uh at jack oh that was the same day yeah you

00:50:38.04 mentioned that we mentioned that on the on that pot on the annual anal passage

00:50:42.05 podcast that we did on Monday yeah oh man at dinner the other night Geoff and I

00:50:47.09 were talking about face Geoff was like yeah you know I think we're done with

00:50:50.22 the bottle phase I wonder what the next phase will be

00:50:53.13 and I was just and I was just about to say oh I've got a pretty good invention

00:50:57.12 and Geoff was like I think I'm done inventing [ __ ] I was like

00:51:01.07 I did I said I think I'm gonna take a break from inventing stuff for a while I

00:51:04.08 don't want to get too old and Gavin goes well I just uh just about to say I have

00:51:08.21 a I've created the next uh nice to three you uh and uh

00:51:12.08 but it's something I can hold on to until enough people have new inventions

00:51:15.22 for the next round of uh uniform pitching I like that idea got something

00:51:19.13 in the bag okay you know it's not it's not a standalone thing it wouldn't hold

00:51:22.14 up on its own but if there were two other inventions to dampen the blow I'm

00:51:26.07 sure it could work take some extra notes so that six months from now when we get

00:51:30.06 back to it you recognize what it is oh that's a good point because I don't

00:51:34.04 think I've written that one down speaking of bob roll

00:51:38.08 the day we recorded last week those popsicles took the life out of me

00:51:42.12 I was a full zombie afterwards I don't really remember the episode we recorded

00:51:47.18 afterward I was drained I was just physically

00:51:50.04 exhausted for the whole day and I'm like I can never have bob roll again I need

00:51:55.05 to take a break from that salad cream is ruined pancakes are are on the on the

00:51:59.13 bench right now as well as it's like oh this is terrible and I went to my

00:52:04.12 mailbox and I opened my mailbox and there was a

00:52:07.17 package waiting for me and I was so excited for a brief moment

00:52:12.03 and then I realized it's the bottle that Gavin sent so now I have

00:52:17.00 two full bottles of bob roll that I have no idea what I'm gonna do with well I

00:52:20.20 can tell you what you're gonna do with them you're gonna spread one on toast

00:52:23.21 and have it that way and then you're gonna you're gonna take a teaspoon of the

00:52:27.11 other and you're gonna mix it in boiling water and drink it like coffee

00:52:32.08 I one day we will get one day one day listen we I feel like we hit bother

00:52:36.06 pretty hard for about four episodes there I think that I think the world

00:52:40.19 could use a little a bottle break so I certainly tomorrow yeah I just like that

00:52:44.15 message I got on uh on amazon

00:52:47.14 what shape is that

00:52:54.12 are you just going to tip it away no no I'll save it and maybe I'll try it

00:52:59.16 again down the road but I just we're on break

00:53:02.21 we're on break with the bottle it might be a good way to heal your

00:53:07.13 bother or damage and we're lying like well just you had

00:53:11.04 it you had it in its worst form potentially and potentially to have a

00:53:15.18 nice delicious warm cup might might heal the taste I feel like you'll be able to

00:53:20.02 try above replacement it might melt your frozen bottle heart

00:53:24.03 because I haven't had bottle in any other form it'd be interesting to hear

00:53:28.03 from you if someone who likes bob roll is it a worse version of bob roll or is

00:53:32.18 it do I just not like bob well what's your favorite food ah that's

00:53:36.17 a that's a tub probably chicken I'd say a chicken dish or like a chicken

00:53:40.15 parmesan right so if you had to eat like

00:53:42.17 a chicken ice cube you probably wouldn't like it but then if you had chicken

00:53:46.18 after you'd be like damn chicken's good that's a fair comparable but barrel sold

00:53:51.11 bobrel pops like it was a thing that they did that's fair

00:53:55.14 so I don't know I feel like the [ __ ]

00:53:58.10 when the company endorses the product in that way it's a different comparable

00:54:03.01 does anybody sell chicken pops because if not

00:54:06.21 unified I could get into that world hold on go ogling frozen

00:54:11.12 I could see like a chicken noodle soup brought a like pop type thing

00:54:15.18 oh that's just what that pop I bet you there's Lester like lesnar makes

00:54:19.19 terrible sodas like that's the company that does like the ranch soda I bet you

00:54:24.00 they got like a chicken soda oh god that's the ugliest thing.

00:54:29.19 [Laughter]

00:54:34.10 Oh I hate it is that just for like presentation or is

00:54:39.01 that frozen that just looks like normal like a Kiev or something yeah I don't

00:54:44.05 know it was for the for the audience it's just a a

00:54:47.14 piece of fried chicken in the shape of a Popsicle with a Popsicle stick and it's

00:54:53.09 like it's just it's [ __ ] gross and I gotta take it out of it is it well it's

00:54:57.14 really good to me it's called chicken Popsicle nuggets oh

00:55:02.10 my god I think if you remove the stick it looks great but the stick's great for

00:55:06.12 dipping it's already dippable it's it's bread oh my god you know what we could

00:55:10.12 call it what pop trickles I hate it like it works popsicles

00:55:25.03 oh my god I inspiration has struck oh I'm going to uh here this is a I had a

00:55:34.10 friend send me this food recently and I think it's the most disgusting thing

00:55:40.05 I've ever seen they loved it I I [ __ ]

00:55:43.14 I had a visceral reaction when I saw it fruit sushi horrendous

00:55:47.18 you like that you think that looks great well what's the white stuff is it rice

00:55:51.22 or is it it's rice it's rice the white stuff is right what's the green stuff

00:55:56.04 I don't know I still don't know I've been trying to figure that out if it's

00:56:00.08 fruit then I'm all about that it looks like a fruit you like that

00:56:05.11 dude I love fruit man what would be bad about that well something has fruit in

00:56:09.12 it like you guys get some like mango in there sometimes or

00:56:12.18 but I just it's too much and the fact that it comes with like a [ __ ]

00:56:16.12 Nutella dip like it's just not what I want from sushi

00:56:20.08 I would eat the [ __ ] out of that I would love that

00:56:24.21 guys from what I can tell there does not exist

00:56:27.18 uh a frozen chicken flavored Popsicle I think the market might be wide open for

00:56:32.05 us this is exciting this is really exciting and to pair it

00:56:35.07 with fruit sushi although it seems like that's been done before you want to

00:56:39.01 stick that in prop f I want to know I want to know what the green thing is

00:56:43.06 do I've been trying to figure it out for days I don't know I think it kind of

00:56:47.09 looks fruit roll-up it looks like a fruit roll-up if that's a fruit roll-up

00:56:52.06 sign me up I would prefer it without I prefer that

00:56:54.20 as like a thinly sliced melon or something or like cucumber or something

00:56:58.23 yeah cucumber is great if the rice was like coconut then I

00:57:02.23 could get on board but the fact that it's like sushi rice

00:57:07.07 rice and fruit I don't like those are all things individually I enjoy but

00:57:12.21 combined it's [ __ ] I'd think this would

00:57:14.19 now this would limit your ability to eat it it'd make it a quicker deal but what

00:57:19.03 if it's what if the the the rice was just like shaved ice like from a like from

00:57:24.13 then you're I'm all in at that point I'm out like it's fruit really dice

00:57:29.15 wrapped in uh I guess either a cucumber or a fruit roll-up I'm all in I think

00:57:35.17 that's great ice ice to me isn't useful in the food it's like good in a cooler

00:57:40.14 if I'm keeping [ __ ] cold that's liquid I

00:57:42.09 don't want to eat ice I don't want ice what about a snow cone a snow cone is so

00:57:47.22 good no get out of here get I got yours the last time you had a snow cone

00:57:52.22 uh probably with you I think I could just see Gavin in a park eating a

00:57:57.09 [ __ ] hot chicken Popsicle be like get out of here

00:58:01.14 we're going we're going to bahama books soon and you're going to get a snow cone

00:58:06.21 and you're gonna [ __ ] like it or else what's that a little place that's on

00:58:12.15 51st street uh [Music]

00:58:14.21 like a snow cone place yeah is it still there oh oh uh casey's

00:58:21.07 new Orleans snow cones yeah yeah I wouldn't yeah you know that's fine that

00:58:25.10 place is so that place is okay there's better places to go I mean that place is

00:58:29.09 like an awesome institution but no no we're gonna go to bahama bucks we're

00:58:32.10 gonna go to the suburbs to a chain and get you some snow cones you want nerd

00:58:36.12 flavored snow cones they got nerd they got a red little snow cone they just

00:58:40.03 came out with I saw god damn it emily's I want to get on the list yeah

00:58:44.06 we've been going to america next time I'm in Austin I want to snoke

00:58:49.05 I [ __ ] love snow counts snow cones are the best they're incredible I it

00:58:53.04 hurts me that Gavin doesn't like ugh I've just never had a good one give me a

00:59:06.22 menu oh it's more than shaved ice it's a menu shaved ice and snow cones oh so is

00:59:12.03 this different to like the one I've had was just like ice and then they'd

00:59:16.04 drizzle a bit of syrup or something in it I think it's that's the heart of it

00:59:20.12 it's the heart of it there's fancier millions you end up with like bits of

00:59:24.01 ice down the side that never had the flavor touch it and this is that's just

00:59:27.12 part of the experience that's a [ __ ]

00:59:29.12 experience no it's a great it's a tough year experience I have a new candy I

00:59:34.02 wasn't sure if I was going to bring this up I don't know if it's better

00:59:38.19 than the gummy nerds but I I just recently discovered that there are

00:59:42.06 skittle gummies the skittle wild berry gummies very good oh yeah yeah dude I've

00:59:47.11 had those I've never had I've just discovered them recently I was like

01:00:03.15 yeah I can't believe I don't like snow cone I stand that he's [ __ ] British

01:00:07.08 he doesn't like anything cold in your mouth

01:00:10.03 you know I have someone ice in my mouth I don't know why but a chicken a hot

01:00:15.01 chicken Popsicle does feel very British to me I can see that

01:00:18.05 I don't know why but there's please call it British please buy it call it by its

01:00:21.22 official uniform name the pop chickle the pop chicken we need to seed it as

01:00:26.11 such we need to get that name out there being from england I like I like the

01:00:30.12 idea of stuff that keeps me warm and that just looks like a hearty meal on a

01:00:34.19 stick this dude would rather eat warm this dude would rather eat warm beef

01:00:39.16 juice than a nice cold banana and black cherry snow cone on a

01:00:45.20 hot day he'd be he'd be like I'm gonna dip my pop chickle in my bother roll and

01:00:52.05 soak that up you are 100 correct what would you put on a Popsicle you dip

01:00:57.18 you did do you cover it what is your like ketchup you just go

01:01:02.06 ketchup I just go ketchup what do you put your what do you well it

01:01:06.23 goes back to what do you put what do you use for your chicken nuggets I use

01:01:11.20 ketchup I could do barbecue sauce but it's hard to be ketchup

01:01:15.20 I feel like barbecue sauce would be good yeah I think I could try barbecue sauce

01:01:19.16 I wish more places made tempura like that should be it's just it's like

01:01:23.08 you deep fry it right like that should be something that's more available

01:01:27.03 I hate that you have to it's limited to essentially Japanese places

01:01:31.14 like I want to be able to go to mcdonald's and get temper I want

01:01:36.04 I want someone to make me fruit sushi with frozen ice

01:01:40.04 now like shaved ice I'm pretty sure that doesn't exist in the world but now I'm

01:01:44.11 thinking about it yeah it's gonna be a nightmare because

01:01:47.15 it's gonna it's gonna melt if it melts then you've got nothing to eat it's just

01:01:50.22 gonna spread out in the well the way it works the way it works right is the way

01:01:55.04 it would work I went to our our our favorite restaurant last night gav the

01:01:59.16 one that you know you and I uh and we went to recently together um

01:02:03.20 and you know for dessert they give you like for instance last night they

01:02:07.22 usually give you this like shaved ice with a little bit of creme fraiche which

01:02:11.02 I could take or leave and then pomegranate but they've changed it now

01:02:14.06 so it's strawberry so it's like strawberry shaved ice with little bits

01:02:17.10 of strawberry and then creme fresh and uh it was so good but it's like you get

01:02:21.17 like it's not like a little digest teeth right like you get it like right at the

01:02:25.11 end of the meal it's basically two bites and you're done I think that the

01:02:28.10 presentation would have to be similar you would get like just one little sushi

01:02:31.11 roll or two little sushi rolls and then yeah it's not meant to stick around

01:02:34.23 meant to just be like a little I feel like those little balls you get there

01:02:38.07 it's like one grain size up from a sorbet it's like somewhere in between a snow

01:02:43.11 cone and a yeah sorbet is great big fan of sorbet oh

01:02:46.23 yeah I absolutely love I'll I'll take just about anything cold yeah I think I

01:02:52.08 think it's a different way like Gavin Gavin grew up

01:02:55.23 in the cold and dreary wet gray england and then I grew up in hot sticky Alabama

01:03:01.14 on the ocean and so uh it was just like 100 humidity and heat all day every day

01:03:07.01 of my life so I uh I was looking for any excuse to put something cold in my

01:03:14.20 mouth yeah makes total sense yeah bye okay that's just because it's full oh.
