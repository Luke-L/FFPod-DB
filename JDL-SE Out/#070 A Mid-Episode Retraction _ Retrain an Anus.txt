00:00:28.05 [Applause]

00:00:32.23 Goddamn dude Henry just farted so bad I thought he I thought he should

00:00:37.22 I thought he shouldn't sleep or something I don't think he did oh my god

00:00:42.22 is there ever a good Henry fart no but this this smells like baby diarrhea

00:00:49.14 he had one the other night I've been meaning to talk about it for a couple

00:00:53.18 weeks he uh I don't I don't know if we've started yet but he farted so bad

00:00:59.01 uh it was a silent fart too mickey you know he kind of lays between Emily

00:01:04.08 he farted so bad it woke her up and she was like half asleep

00:01:07.14 and he just I was like on my phone reading uh on Reddit and uh he farted

00:01:12.08 and I was like oh Chris that's rough you know and I just barrel through but she

00:01:18.04 actually turned over and she was like uh that's bad

00:01:21.20 and I went I went what and she just goes eggs and then just went back to sleep

00:01:27.01 what I I don't I don't even think she knows

00:01:30.01 she did it yeah she farted or he farted she woke up rolled over just in her

00:01:34.03 sleep said it's so bad and I said what and she goes eggs and then just went

00:01:39.09 back to snoring was that the story that was postponed from last week yeah

00:01:44.02 I was going to tell them the bigger way but it's it's essentially

00:01:48.06 that's all that happened we could redo that if you want we go no

00:01:51.12 no no no no I just I want to barrel through it because I feel like we have

00:01:54.15 so much other stuff to talk about and a lingering fart story it's you know well

00:01:58.01 I'm just I need to know is there any way that you can is Henry like the perfect

00:02:03.07 equalizer in hiding farts like can you get farts under the radar oh my god dude

00:02:08.13 are you kidding I you know we have the whole thing about how my girlfriend

00:02:13.19 has never [ __ ] right and uh and how I'm pretty sure she throws it in the yard

00:02:18.13 and I clean it up thinking it's the dogs uh I'm reasonably sure

00:02:22.15 that at least sixty percent of the time it's her not the dog farting what if

00:02:27.01 Henry has never fought what if Henry has never far she woke

00:02:31.07 herself up with her ex well he definitely farted in this room a few

00:02:35.08 seconds ago but yeah it uh it's entirely possible and I'm I'm super amenable to

00:02:41.14 the idea that she's been hiding she's been hiding her farts as his have

00:02:46.12 you ever attempted to cover one of yours as his

00:02:49.13 no because I don't hide farts dude I don't embrace people yeah I mean you

00:02:53.03 recorded them you wanted to do a service

00:02:55.11 around yes I made it with my body I want I want the world to know about my farts

00:03:01.11 anyway this is face would you well is this 70 right last one

00:03:05.11 was is this 70 I said 70.70. I believe so that's quite a lot where does the

00:03:09.15 time go yeah do you get the feeling that seven looks

00:03:13.00 it looks like a way bigger number than six in a lot of ways that yeah

00:03:17.22 like eight isn't tons more than seven but seven seems loads more than six

00:03:23.15 yeah no it's the look of a seven yeah yeah no I'm more intimidated by an eight

00:03:28.06 than a so you think you think like everything's pretty low and then eight

00:03:32.12 happens it's like whoa yeah because the six is like a smaller version of an

00:03:36.04 eight if like you that if that six got jacked up fully grown like a fully

00:03:40.13 developed like I feel like a six evolves

00:03:43.18 into an eight yeah I guess just 70 feels like you know you don't you don't feel

00:03:47.14 like a six like for me a six is balls drop and it spins and it becomes a nine

00:03:53.20 that's how I said that well where does the eight come in is so

00:03:58.13 is an eight completely unrelated to the six in the in the genealogy tree of

00:04:02.15 these numbers oh you're trying to like figure out which numbers had sex to make

00:04:07.03 yeah so because like Geoff is bringing up a

00:04:10.12 great point listen a seven is the is is a two and a five fooling around two and

00:04:15.19 a five like if a two and a five had a baby it probably would be a seven you

00:04:19.15 get a little bit of the five or maybe a one and a two maybe that's what it is a

00:04:23.05 one and a two had sex adding two and five no I'm just thinking of the the

00:04:28.11 look of those numbers yeah I think a seven looks harsh I feel like a seven's

00:04:32.03 like it like cuts through you yeah do you think David fincher has any

00:04:36.02 responsibility for your views of seven do you think that has influenced you in

00:04:40.08 any way I've actually never seen it really okay no no I don't say that's a

00:04:44.11 no good movie though it is a good movie does that hold up though as a movie

00:04:48.12 probably not probably not yeah I haven't seen it in a very long time what movies

00:04:52.04 do you think have a have a funny perspective based like there's some like

00:04:55.18 epic movies out there but if you were just stood in one place for the entire

00:04:59.05 movie some of them are pretty interesting like

00:05:02.11 like an interstellar I haven't seen it the main main guy takes off in a rocket

00:05:08.21 docks it to a space station drives the whole thing for about two

00:05:13.03 years to saturn goes through a black hole and then

00:05:18.00 like 80 years later comes out without any of that [ __ ] just flowing

00:05:22.18 be weird if you're just waiting there for it you would miss out on obviously

00:05:27.12 all of the movie but from that perspective you'd be very confused

00:05:31.09 do you think like the perspective of what's happening in the world the lord

00:05:35.16 of the rings from just a hobbit we don't know

00:05:39.12 he lives in the shire he's neighbors with the guy

00:05:43.16 like over here sings occasionally do you think they have like local news they're

00:05:46.23 getting like updates like ah they're working with the trees now

00:05:51.11 like what is that perspective I've also been trying to figure out the

00:05:56.02 uh the ratio between the movie that is the shortest compared with how long it

00:06:01.16 feels and I think I've got the ultimate film for a movie that

00:06:05.15 feels like it's four hours long but it's in fact quite a neat

00:06:09.22 90 minutes yeah I think I have one too I need to look up how long it is what is

00:06:13.14 yours mine is a razor head [Laughter]

00:06:21.14 are you gonna [ __ ] stand here or sit where are you standing right now we're

00:06:26.20 sitting what's that are you gonna sat here and tell me you I see you and I sat

00:06:32.02 there and watched a racer head together and you didn't like it

00:06:35.14 no I I thought it was very interesting very weird it's fun to watch

00:06:39.20 something that is just bizarre and to the point where you're just looking at

00:06:43.09 it almost just like what is happening but god damn does that

00:06:47.08 feel like a four-hour movie and it's exactly 90 minutes it is it's

00:06:52.13 exceptionally dense that movie there's a lot

00:06:55.18 and I think I think black and white adds

00:06:59.06 at least 45 minutes to it you should see the documentary about the filming of

00:07:02.23 that movie it's really interesting you know he uh he shot one scene a day for

00:07:06.21 five years that's how he made that film yeah why sounds like a diaper or maybe

00:07:11.00 18 months or something but it was I think it was like ridiculous like five

00:07:14.01 years uh they were well he got a grant from the op from like the los Angeles

00:07:18.15 film commission or one or like one of those

00:07:21.07 people or the American film society one of those it might have been an American

00:07:24.15 film study anyway he won or got a grant uh and then they let him shoot like on a

00:07:29.05 location a property that they owned but he could only shoot at night because it

00:07:32.21 was just a day or something so they shot one scene a night for like five weird

00:07:37.11 yeah what a fascinating way to shoot a movie yeah uh

00:07:40.15 and I just I looked it is long but it feels longer it feels like a five-hour

00:07:45.20 movie the tree of life it's a two-hour 18-minute movie it feels

00:07:50.01 like it's six hours long it's very weird I feel like it's incoherent it's okay

00:07:54.03 like I I don't think many people listening would probably have seen it

00:07:57.06 it's a Terrence Malik movie it's fine yeah I don't think a lot of people have

00:08:01.11 seen a razor head have you guys have you

00:08:05.12 uh have you guys ever watched the crown on Netflix no

00:08:08.23 that's an hour-long tv show I challenge you to watch one hour of

00:08:14.08 that show and and come back and tell me it felt like one hour every time emily's

00:08:19.20 got that show on it's like time stops it is it's seven hours it's like a ken

00:08:24.20 burns documentary every episode like a full ken ken burns ten

00:08:29.00 points like yeah it's like ken burns baseball every is crammed into

00:08:33.09 62 minutes or whatever on of a [ __ ]

00:08:36.17 Netflix [ __ ]

00:08:38.13 I have a pitch for for one of the like kind of an idea

00:08:41.16 you're describing Gavin this is a terrible idea in my head but I I would

00:08:45.10 just I'd like to see this show you know talking about like a show or like a

00:08:50.04 perspective where nothing happens I want to show

00:08:52.11 in the game of thrones universe but it's current day

00:08:55.17 and it just follows like a classroom of kids and that's their history like

00:08:59.09 that's just the world they live in like it's completely normal it's like our

00:09:03.09 world now but their history is the [ __ ]

00:09:06.06 Daenerys and all that [ __ ] but they've got like iPhones and stuff yeah they

00:09:09.19 have iPhones they're just it's like ours because I think about when I was a kid

00:09:13.10 in school I didn't give a [ __ ] about history like I couldn't care less and

00:09:17.15 now as an adult I have an appreciation for how interesting it is I just love

00:09:23.03 the idea of like what we perceive as a great drama show

00:09:26.00 being the history for this world and kids like I don't give a [ __ ] about

00:09:29.22 anything you think you think it'll be like like how every 10th grader rolls

00:09:33.08 their eyes when it's like here we go with Nazis again it's like oh my god

00:09:38.15 these [ __ ] these [ __ ] white walkers yeah

00:09:42.00 you better go bored you'd be speaking valerian if it wasn't for these.

00:09:50.22 [Music]

00:09:55.16 I just think it's the concept of like that being your history and how it would

00:10:00.11 impact the culture going forward also just I like the idea of kids not

00:10:04.06 appreciating because I I certainly didn't I didn't I didn't either at all I

00:10:08.06 didn't I didn't give a rats about history now it's probably one of my largest

00:10:13.05 interests about [ __ ]

00:10:15.04 yeah I feel like I did school at completely the wrong time yeah like I

00:10:20.03 would love if I was going into uh I don't know 12th grade right now I'd be

00:10:24.19 pretty pumped about it pretty exciting oh yeah I'd love to be just rolling into

00:10:31.01 my gcses right now bit of year 10.

00:10:33.09 I know exactly what I wanted to do oh it'd be brilliant I would love for there

00:10:36.15 to be a real billy Madison like program I just want to realist I want to do it

00:10:40.05 all over I feel like I've got more perspective on life I'm more

00:10:43.06 enthusiastic about learning there's things I've I've clearly missed a lot

00:10:46.18 with the shift key I could use this if there's anyone who deserves a second go

00:10:51.03 through [ __ ] should we just had a merch meeting

00:10:54.08 and we were talking about ideas uh from new merch we should come up with a shift

00:10:59.05 oh we should sell shift or just a shirt with just the up arrow on it no I like

00:11:03.12 the idea of just selling a shift key just a singular key

00:11:08.08 oh like you can do this shirt as well but could it just be like a giant like

00:11:14.01 the button we made like a huge shift key we can push it we can push it and when

00:11:18.22 you push it it's just Gavin going [ __ ]

00:11:22.17 or jack who doesn't is somebody yeah jack doesn't believe you liar liar liar.

00:11:28.11 [Laughter]

00:11:32.02 Oh that's [ __ ] great to be fair there are a lot of keys on

00:11:36.07 the keyboard that I have no idea what they do and I've used the keyboard

00:11:40.09 almost every day for two decades I had another realization that I'm scared to

00:11:44.12 talk about after the shift key thing but it is something I I made recently like

00:11:49.07 I'd say within the past four months or so it's not it's not new but I just

00:11:53.18 didn't know this and I don't think it's a big deal I I

00:11:57.18 think this might actually be a thing that some other people don't know but

00:12:01.23 uh rock band rock band was a game everyone remember rock band how much fun

00:12:07.20 that was yeah I I had rock man and I thought the coolest part

00:12:10.20 of rock band was the fact it had drums because guitar hero already had the

00:12:14.05 guitars I'm not going to sing like this is not something that interests me but

00:12:18.04 the drums are [ __ ] cool you get to smash these things it's great

00:12:22.00 I did not realize that you could just hold the pedal down

00:12:25.10 and continue to play I thought that you couldn't I thought you could only use

00:12:28.23 the pedal when that note would appear in the game track to hit it I had no clue

00:12:34.10 uh yeah the pedal for like what was it was

00:12:37.15 it for like holding down the the cymbal part I was like

00:12:40.13 it was like the kick drum it was like it was like to kick the drum

00:12:43.21 you you'd have to I think when you properly play I think as Eric is saying

00:12:48.10 I think that's how you properly play the drums is you just hold the pedal down

00:12:51.20 and then you release and kick when you need to so whenever that would scroll

00:12:55.14 through I would click it the problem is my foot

00:12:58.11 would cramp up because you're not supposed to keep your foot at that angle

00:13:01.19 so I could play like two or three songs then I'd be in pain I'd be like this

00:13:05.12 sucks I wish this was fun I went through my whole life of rock band thinking I

00:13:09.22 couldn't do that I thought if I held it

00:13:11.15 down it would [ __ ] up the other notes I

00:13:13.16 hit and it caused so much discomfort and I realized like four months ago you

00:13:17.14 could just hold it down I think that's okay also are you still

00:13:22.13 playing rock band no but I talked to somebody about rock band the other day

00:13:26.15 it was just it blew my mind at the time you don't have room for rock band in

00:13:31.20 your room no you do not no I don't I really don't it's a problem

00:13:35.20 Eric says Eric says people are pissed about the shift key are they I feel like

00:13:40.03 we went over that I don't know I don't know if they're pissed about the shift

00:13:43.11 care not but I do think it's I do think the idea of shift keys as a merch is

00:13:46.11 funny or maybe people should mail you their shift keys I don't know uh there's

00:13:49.17 definitely something why don't they mail me my sh

00:13:52.12 why so you can use them now because now you know how shift works yeah but they

00:13:55.14 do that's a great point that's where I was going with this that is what's going

00:14:00.12 with this is uh is uh scrump has become a global phenomenon already

00:14:05.01 the world has embraced scrumping in a big way

00:14:08.02 we're very excited about scrumping I saw a lot of stuff on the Instagram stories

00:14:14.00 of people picking apples today is uh just put this in context today is Thursday

00:14:19.20 September 16th when we're recording this I believe the this coming up Tuesday we

00:14:25.22 will we'll be picking up our metallic uh scrumpy yard signs so that we can

00:14:31.16 sell them wow we are gonna sell notice no scrumping uh metal signs

00:14:37.01 uh eric's typing and he's either about to say yes that's correct or Geoff you

00:14:40.13 weren't supposed to talk about that yeah

00:14:42.21 number four on the image oh yeah so it's like it's a black white and red sign

00:14:46.13 that says notice no scrumping and it'll be in the store I guess next week is

00:14:50.02 that yeah I'd love to have that on my lawn I just feel like it would make my

00:14:53.07 neighbors talk to me though which is not something I want right

00:14:57.06 do you think that old lady who threw the

00:14:59.16 cucumbers would come to the door she saw the sign she needs a clarification

00:15:03.11 I don't know what scrumping is but I hope it's not throwing cucumbers at your

00:15:07.20 house maybe she scrumped those cucumbers that's why she was trying to shift

00:15:12.23 do you think Andre I was thinking about another thing that is is uh very

00:15:16.23 frequently used but I think some people don't know it when you reply to an email

00:15:21.15 what does it put in the subject line I don't even know how to answer that

00:15:24.20 question what do you mean what when I answer an email what does it

00:15:28.10 put in the subject line I mean this isn't the question I just want you to

00:15:31.11 understand what I'm talking about like it has the subject of an email when you

00:15:34.20 hit reply it changes the subject it adds two letters yeah it does yeah

00:15:40.21 do you really not know what two letters it is no

00:15:44.23 okay I wrote an email like I replied to an email a minute ago sort of defeats

00:15:48.19 the um misconception that some people have about the two letters what do you do

00:15:54.06 what's oh yeah okay yeah no I yeah yeah what does that mean

00:15:58.04 I've well [ __ ] now I need to think about

00:16:01.07 it let's think about this for a minute okay

00:16:05.03 uh so my initial just gut read on this would be responding to email um re

00:16:09.20 response maybe could be that could be some of those are tricky where you'd

00:16:14.15 think it'd be res if it was response but it might just be re

00:16:18.21 it's not resident evil that's also something that comes to mind I can

00:16:22.01 narrow that out

00:16:24.08 Gavin I didn't think this was something people didn't know until this moment and

00:16:30.12 Andrew definitely doesn't know r e returning return return email could

00:16:35.19 that be it because you're responding it's like you're

00:16:39.07 if you imagine you know physically good you've not really got I feel like most

00:16:44.19 people think it's for reply oh okay well respond kind of in the same

00:16:51.07 it's like second plate and reply would be first like it's in the same thing but

00:16:56.18 it's uh regarding and then the subject oh so

00:17:00.12 that's the because so not only did you not understand what I was saying at the

00:17:04.23 beginning your misconception was completely different anyway I don't know

00:17:10.12 why I asked Eric says he still thinks it's resident evil

00:17:14.13 I feel like all of mine outside of resident evil joke answer better than

00:17:18.23 regarding I know regarding is just fine yeah how often do you say regarding

00:17:23.07 you're dating I don't say regard I say in regards to fairly often I think sure

00:17:28.23 okay that's acceptable I just don't like regarding I don't I don't know it's not

00:17:33.11 a rotational word for me well hey you know what if you don't like it we won't

00:17:37.00 say it how about that we will ban that word from this show I don't think we

00:17:40.03 need to ban I'm just saying if I'm writing an email I feel like there are a

00:17:43.22 lot better options who decided it means regarding who made that's not from email

00:17:47.09 I don't think I assume it's from uh like

00:17:49.17 old old writing I learned it in a letter writing class like in fifth grade or

00:17:54.00 something what do you mean like when you like learn how to write

00:17:57.05 letters like professional letters and [ __ ] in school like when I was a kid I

00:18:02.12 learned already in regards or regarding huh

00:18:04.20 okay see my confusion was I was thinking about did people send letters back and

00:18:09.04 forth like the same letter like a reply email but physical

00:18:13.06 because in my head that makes no sense but to do regarding

00:18:16.21 so they write you a letter and then you just write regarding the letter you sent

00:18:20.13 and then how would you well yeah because you say like or like re that question

00:18:25.00 you asked or whatever you know yeah because back then when you

00:18:28.04 responded to a letter if you're using new paper you wouldn't

00:18:31.11 quote the entire letter under your response so you actually have to say

00:18:35.05 this is what I'm replying to yeah yeah I don't I don't think I'd ever write a

00:18:38.16 letter with the intent of having it be a

00:18:41.05 continued conversation that seems like a

00:18:43.05 lot of work oh you're one and done don't tell me yeah well no no okay here's the

00:18:46.23 it's like imagine a volley in a tennis game but every game is a different match

00:18:51.05 I don't expect the continuation of the conversation what if you were writing to

00:18:55.09 someone and you asked a bunch of stuff and then then you only need a response

00:18:59.01 for like one thing they would probably write what they were responding to yeah

00:19:02.05 well I I feel like I don't need them to say regarding this I feel like I could

00:19:05.08 just get the answer I wrote to them I know what I wrote so if someone replied

00:19:08.15 to something you wrote and they just wrote four

00:19:11.06 yeah wouldn't you be like what are they talking about well nobody would do that

00:19:14.14 though they would provide they wouldn't say regarding they would just

00:19:18.19 they'd be like I want uh I don't know what are we talking about

00:19:22.01 how many apples have you scrumped recently if I asked that and if they

00:19:25.11 replied four I'd understand what that meant yeah I would I would I wouldn't

00:19:30.06 need them to say in regards to the scrumping I I wonder I wonder what your

00:19:35.01 quality of life would have been like in a world before the internet like 30

00:19:40.13 years I think Andrew was born at the correct time I think so too I really do

00:19:44.07 I wonder how he would navigate a pre in the convenience of modern internet

00:19:49.00 world no I would adapt if I grew up in a different time I'd be different me I

00:19:52.03 don't think you can measure current Andrew as opposed to a different time

00:19:57.07 period age so what caused you what I don't know uh what like

00:20:00.18 what do you mean how is it concerning you wouldn't be like the way you are if

00:20:05.03 you were knocking about with the tudors and stuff

00:20:07.17 I don't understand what caused me yeah like you are you if uh but why like who

00:20:13.12 sculpted you my environment I guess I don't know

00:20:16.05 that's such a weird one well what's had the biggest impact is it like your

00:20:19.15 school friends is it your parents I think all of it impacts you to an extent

00:20:24.06 I think yeah kind of the era you live in the people around you your parents your

00:20:27.15 background I think all that kind of shapes you into the person you are

00:20:31.10 and then you kind of acquire your own experiences as you get older no man

00:20:36.03 don't let me forget I don't want to change the subject from this but I

00:20:39.16 expect I had a new experience in Vegas uh that I have got to share with you

00:20:43.12 guys later um I lost my trade of thought I just think

00:20:46.23 I you know I bet you I'd be [ __ ]

00:20:48.15 great at writing letters if I was in a letter time I'd have a quill I'd get it

00:20:52.11 all fancy I'd have nice that's what we did that's what we did before the

00:20:56.19 internet we used quills but you wouldn't you wouldn't ever type re colon no

00:21:02.01 no I wouldn't I think it'd be outrageous in my head a letter is you kind of put

00:21:07.07 all your thoughts out there and then they acknowledge some of it and put all

00:21:10.13 their thoughts it's not really an ongoing conversation you know volley

00:21:13.11 it's a different thing you definitely vol we definitely used to follow in

00:21:18.06 letters that's how you would have conversations

00:21:20.14 with people far away man if you didn't want to pay a thousand dollar phone bill

00:21:24.13 uh yeah I mean yeah I'm just saying now I'm saying my perception of what letters

00:21:28.23 are in the environment I grew up in if I grew up in a different if I was in the

00:21:32.21 lighter time if I said the letter days the olden times the letter era.

00:21:39.09 I will say regardless of when when I was born I'd never understand how faxing

00:21:45.01 works no clue that's just a thing that would

00:21:48.02 never work in my head couldn't process that

00:21:52.08 I'd never faxed you've never understood facts I'd never be a faxer you got to

00:21:57.15 put a phone number in or something it seems very unnecessary I think that's

00:22:01.08 more you think that's less convenient than writing and then mailing a letter

00:22:05.20 yeah because as I think I've talked about the show before mail terrifies me

00:22:09.16 I don't understand how any of it works it's just magic it's the equivalent of

00:22:13.11 magic to me I feel like male is the easiest thing to understand you

00:22:16.23 physically write male and then someone takes it to where you write it doesn't

00:22:20.23 involve a modem it doesn't involve [ __ ]

00:22:23.01 no it doesn't involve silicon in any way

00:22:25.00 it's the process that blows my mind that I could write a letter to France and

00:22:28.04 they would be able to deliver it accurately and I could depend on that

00:22:31.16 and all I have to do is write an address on it and put some stamps and I'm good

00:22:36.06 but sending a text wirelessly to someone in France that's easy that's that's not

00:22:42.06 magic well that is it's all magic but there's a physical component to it

00:22:47.05 the fact that somebody's having to hold my letter and and move it like it's

00:22:52.15 touching several people's hands there's like a level of personal touch

00:22:57.14 to mail that I think is wild or just sending a text is [ __ ] crazy

00:23:02.07 it's ridiculous it's amazing that that's a thing that can happen

00:23:06.10 but it's just not there's so many I don't know there's so

00:23:10.13 many ways a letter can go wrong and I don't feel the same way about a text

00:23:16.00 yeah I guess to a point that there's no way your text will like fall down the

00:23:20.23 back of a trolley and get stuck behind a

00:23:24.02 wall for 10 years exactly I had listen I ordered popcorn from Toronto once I got

00:23:28.10 it from across [ __ ] Canada and they shipped it and just got lost my

00:23:32.11 text if it gets lost I get a little symbol on it and I can resend it a

00:23:37.16 minute later my popcorn was lost for weeks weeks it was lost

00:23:42.08 you had the same speed of feedback to lost mail like you ordered the popcorn

00:23:48.17 10 seconds later it's like we lost it.

00:23:52.04 I found it I got the popcorn it was just in a warehouse they forgot it existed I

00:23:56.05 think because I complained and that it showed up the next day but then I was

00:23:59.12 like is this fresh popcorn like I can't how do I judge the quality of this thing

00:24:02.21 it was very good I'd recommend the honey mustard popcorn very good I didn't even

00:24:08.08 show you but yeah it's good buttered also good [Applause]

00:24:13.16 are you the kind of person who falls asleep already thinking about the next

00:24:19.00 morning's coffee well I am yes to that question would you consider yourself a

00:24:23.17 certified coffee nerd or a professed coffee newbie uh I would say I'm

00:24:28.11 somewhere in the I'm certainly not a newbie uh I don't know that I'm a I

00:24:31.21 don't know I don't take take my coffee as seriously as the people of Australia

00:24:35.01 or anything but I'm I'm into it I'd dig my coffee either way you need to hear

00:24:38.19 about trade okay Geoff tell me about trade okay Geoff I will does your at-home

00:24:43.16 coffee just not live up to your expectations oh

00:24:46.02 hitting you right at home or where it hurts they know they're like uh sure in

00:24:50.12 public you'll be like no my my at home coffee is just fine why would you ask

00:24:53.18 but they know what's going on behind closed doors interesting seems like

00:24:57.18 trade can change that trade's goal is to make every cup of coffee your best ever

00:25:02.13 why that sounds like a really worthwhile goal I could get into that the journey

00:25:08.04 to your perfect cup starts with taking their coffee quick I like taking quizzes

00:28:59.14 hey I got a question uh now that we're 25 minutes in Jesus Christ what do you

00:29:04.15 guys want to what do you guys want to talk about this episode I I would like

00:29:09.07 to briefly talk about the fact that um Andrew I thought Andrew was doing a bit

00:29:13.18 over text and this just makes it even better

00:29:16.16 imagine this being written and delivered and the the

00:29:20.05 the carbon footprint involved this was done over post yeah Andrew wrote

00:29:27.16 well wait wait wait a second wait a second before you say that let me just

00:29:32.06 ask Geoff okay Geoff who performed the Keenan and kale rap I have no idea what

00:29:36.19 you're talking about see I'm I'm I'm way too old for that [ __ ] I

00:29:41.17 I know who those actors are obviously Geoff doesn't even remember we talked

00:29:46.15 about this oh my god did we talk about the Keenan and kel rap

00:29:50.21 did that last episode just

00:29:55.05 what's going on are you both doing a bit now I'm going nuts

00:30:01.14 no I'm good we're talking about Keenan and kell last week yes oh my god

00:30:06.17 why would.

00:30:13.16 [Laughter]

00:30:17.16 I rode a roller coaster with Keenan was that what we were talking about oh my

00:30:23.01 god I thought Andrew was doing a bit because I thought it would be insane

00:30:28.04 that he didn't oh Andrew out of nowhere a day after we recorded last week.

00:30:33.01 [Music]

00:30:34.21 Said you didn't mention coolio does the Keenan and kell rap that's wild I just

00:30:40.20 wrote considering we just talked about it the day before is this a bit

00:30:45.06 he said did you mention that yesterday and I just said this is a bit and then

00:30:50.04 you were I'm very confused back and forth blah blah blah I checked the freaking

00:30:54.16 episode I mentioned coolio by name three times while I was telling the story

00:30:59.12 about how I was stuck in a simulation oh no one heard it did anyone hear that oh

00:31:04.11 no you were stuck in a simulation because uh [ __ ] kept conveniently

00:31:08.16 popping up after you talked about it I remember that I think it was the other

00:31:12.06 way but yeah I at least remembered that we discussed the keane in a kell rap I

00:31:16.19 just I somehow missed the fact that it was coolia and I was three times by name

00:31:22.18 I feel like I remember coolio more than Keenan and kell he didn't remember any

00:31:28.00 of it we just went through this what do you mean

00:31:31.11 well no he said coolio it's coolio's jogging my memory a little bit

00:31:35.15 or maybe it's just that we've talked about coolio on Instagram in the past

00:31:38.20 maybe that's yeah have we ever taken his

00:31:41.05 account yet isn't that the plan was that hey can I ask a question was I in this

00:31:44.09 episode yeah yeah you were there yeah you've been in everyone

00:31:48.00 that I know about that's true I guess well wait was there was there one that

00:31:52.08 we did that oh no you weren't there for part of one I forgot about that

00:31:57.05 remember that you weren't there yeah we did the thing where uh Geoff left

00:32:02.08 and then some reason we all came back and it was Eric

00:32:04.22 and I think and we threw the beginning through the ball to each other yeah we

00:32:08.23 talked about coolio there though no he didn't it was just the point Geoff said

00:32:13.05 was I there for it I said you've been in every upset how's uh

00:32:16.07 how's cool you're doing these days so great we still we still haven't

00:32:19.03 overtaken his Instagram according to Eric we gotta catch we had catch up on

00:32:22.12 that damn I just I love I love that you didn't even [ __ ] remember it Gavin

00:32:26.12 was gonna make fun of me for for not hearing the coolio thing you had no idea

00:32:31.01 what we're talking about no I just don't understa

00:32:33.08 is this the best gas lighting in all the world is this no the best performance of

00:32:37.21 all time I need to say that I'm wrong I need to apologize right now what Geoff

00:32:42.05 just did made me realize that regarding is essential regarding is an essential

00:32:47.00 part of the letter you need to include it and the context

00:32:51.22 right right now holy [ __ ] because there'd be

00:32:55.03 six letters just explaining who Julio is

00:32:59.09 I apologize I'm wrong about that wow you gotta have regardless

00:33:04.10 that was a mid-episode retraction that's awesome that was yeah

00:33:09.01 very mature of you Andrew well I didn't very soon I've never

00:33:13.14 encountered what you just did I thought you'd know I was kind of honestly trying

00:33:18.23 to team myself up to look more foolish and then you were like I don't even know

00:33:23.18 and then I was like hold my root beer

00:33:26.19 god dude

00:33:30.19 [ __ ] this is a dumb show it is a dumb show is that your point was that you

00:33:35.23 said it a bunch Gavin I didn't hear it was that what you were going is that

00:33:39.09 what you want to talk about well my point was gonna be can you believe

00:33:42.21 Andrew didn't hear from you and Geoff was gonna be like yeah he

00:33:45.12 mentioned it three times and uh suddenly my point out the window

00:33:50.06 this is in regarding to last week's episode right my point was down the back

00:33:55.02 of a trolley [Laughter]

00:33:57.18 by the wall

00:33:59.18 so what happened in Vegas Geoff okay okay so here's here's what we need

00:34:04.20 to discuss a couple things okay we're running out of time uh first off let me

00:34:08.14 just get this out of the way there's not

00:34:10.19 gonna be any arguments there's not gonna be any disruption about it we're just

00:34:13.20 gonna barrel we're gonna barrel through this Andrew and you're not gonna [ __ ]

00:34:18.04 this up for me Gavin you don't even have to say anything uh October 1st the

00:34:24.11 bat knobs go on sale on the rooster that's all I'm gonna say October 1st the

00:34:29.18 bat knobs go for sale maybe you get an extra item maybe you don't you got like

00:34:33.19 a one in ten chance uh of maybe we'll throw in something extra but if you buy

00:34:37.10 a bat knob on October 1st you'll get a bat knob and maybe something else that's

00:34:41.18 all okay uh are you gonna talk about all

00:34:43.23 these bat handles bat knobs on the store yes yes uh we're gonna call them bat

00:34:48.12 knobs uh I went to Vegas for Andrew need to talk

00:34:51.20 about that something happened to me in Vegas that's very embarrassing I need to

00:34:55.20 talk about that uh I discovered a new thing that I like to do way too much and

00:35:02.02 then Gavin and I came up with uh a modified stunt we want to do and we've

00:35:06.07 got some homework for you Andrew okay I want to cover all that [ __ ] I'm

00:35:10.03 very excited about the homework can I just I I don't know if we should talk

00:35:14.01 about it I in an extensive way I will say that so we had the merch meeting

00:35:18.13 today and we laid out everything and and I believe Geoff you're like okay we all

00:35:22.04 agree but just as a heads up we're gonna explain this to Gavin he's gonna

00:35:25.12 immediately challenge what is being said what we all

00:35:28.12 agreed upon I wasn't vocal in the meeting some of it still doesn't make

00:35:32.02 sense to me oh I know I I know I I I a little bird told me later that you were

00:35:36.07 having post meeting issues that's why I said you're not gonna we're just gonna

00:35:39.20 barrel through it okay I just want to say I ordered it I don't understand a

00:35:44.09 knob maybe maybe it comes with a logo device I don't know but you're getting

00:35:48.05 it you buy a knob you're getting a knob and it'll be numbered I don't I don't

00:35:53.05 know what this like I don't um I think they should all come in the same

00:35:57.05 box regardless of if the logo device

00:36:03.14 can I talk about something unrelated that was sort of brought up at the merch

00:36:07.12 meeting yeah I don't know if we should talk about this we could edit this out I

00:36:11.00 guess if we want to how many baseballs do you think Geoff could consecutively

00:36:15.12 swing at Gavin before he just broke he's in a batting cage and he's trying to

00:36:19.11 he's like going for a home run every time yeah if he's swinging he's trying

00:36:23.02 to make good contact on each ball how many times do you think he could swing

00:36:26.13 before his arms give out 50. Geoff thinks he can swing at a thousand balls

00:36:34.02 okay we weren't going to talk about that

00:36:37.11 because that's a whole other whole other

00:36:41.07 lane we want to go into I do think I can swing

00:36:45.07 there's no ears and ears there's no way well you gonna be there for two days

00:36:49.12 and eric's over here going there's even more baseball stuff listen we're gonna

00:36:54.19 get derailed on the baseball card yes yes there's more baseball stuff yes

00:36:59.20 I think I we were discussing what to sell next

00:37:02.09 and I Andrew had mentioned that it seems weird that we don't have we have all

00:37:05.22 this other baseball [ __ ] we don't have a baseball and then Eric brought up uh

00:37:10.11 we're not a baseball podcast and which is a fair point and then and then it

00:37:14.20 would have to make sense and I said I I had the idea a couple weeks ago that

00:37:18.22 like what if if we sold baseballs what if I hit each baseball with a bat first

00:37:24.13 like so each bat came each ball came each ball came pre-hit pre-tested uh

00:37:30.03 like pre-dinged right and then they were asking me how many I thought I

00:37:34.17 could hit and I was like I could hit a thousand baseballs sure

00:37:38.23 I didn't say I could do it all at once but I can and I would

00:37:43.12 no the scenario you proposed was like one time in a dugout just swinging away

00:37:47.12 what I loved about it is Geoff said it so confidently and then somebody quietly

00:37:51.21 the meeting was like you know maybe we could just sell like 200 of them

00:37:56.23 like they were concerned about your health

00:38:01.14 that's also a good point that's a good point that that nick brings up or Eric

00:38:07.12 brings up I only have to try to hit him if I strike out that still counts we

00:38:13.07 just won't sell that one for as much so you can own a baseball

00:38:17.01 that went past Geoff we'll separate the hit balls versus the strikeout balls

00:38:21.14 and the home run balls is all you can pick one on the other oh my god you

00:38:25.16 would hit like 70 balls and then you would just be ripping the boxes open

00:38:28.22 just thumping like 10 at once I don't know and this all this all goes

00:38:34.04 back to this other I'm gonna do this my girlfriend and I got into an argument

00:38:39.12 about something and oh she's very [ __ ] motivated to make it happen

00:38:43.03 let me ask you I didn't I didn't think we were going to

00:38:45.15 talk about this but Gavin let me ask you a question how hard

00:38:49.07 how fast do you think you could throw a baseball oh

00:38:53.03 probably not Larry and I'll say this a major league baseball like a major

00:38:57.22 league baseball player throws a fastball anywhere from 92 to 100 miles an hour

00:39:02.08 typically I I could I bet I could do 60.

00:39:05.12 Okay so gavin's a reasonable person I I think

00:39:08.04 you could do 60 as well I don't think that's what I'm not throwing a thousand

00:39:11.16 bulls you just got to one oh how fast could you throw it though you

00:39:15.21 think you thought 60 miles an hour I thought this was me serving you up for

00:39:19.11 hitting a wall no no no just how fast could you throw a basement it's

00:39:23.03 unrelated it's madness and then a different way gab it is unrelated but

00:39:28.08 equally insane yeah I'm going to say 60.

00:39:30.19 Okay I don't know if that's good or not I mean if they're doing 90 then that's

00:39:36.08 barely anything in comparison what about you uh well

00:39:40.22 I'm reasonably certain that I could throw a baseball

00:39:45.04 with training I gotta take an incineration you know I I fell on the

00:39:50.01 shoulder last year with the or with the in the bike the bike rack and I have uh

00:39:54.22 I had that mri and I have a troubling amount of arthritis right so I'm gonna

00:39:59.07 have to I'm gonna have to put myself in a regimen of stretching

00:40:03.10 and uh and probably uh yeah some definitely like at least a month of

00:40:08.01 stretching and maybe some yeah some range imagine me sending a bit of post

00:40:12.12 saying how fast can you throw the ball and I got that in response yeah all

00:40:16.10 right regarding regarding the baseball speed the back

00:40:20.00 side of the letter you had to flip it over and he's still dead

00:40:23.01 still qualified regarding I'm just regarding that I think I can throw a

00:40:28.08 baseball 80 miles an hour oh my god really I think so no way

00:40:32.21 there's a zero percent chance you find that all you want there's no my

00:40:36.21 girlfriend my girlfriend bought a baseball that records the speed you

00:40:41.09 throw it at so I can we at some point uh what's your what's your fastest so

00:40:46.10 far I haven't done it at all yet wait you own a baseball that measures its own

00:40:51.20 speed and you never threw it yet that's correct

00:40:55.12 huh I don't under why why would you not throw it immediately don't do it now uh

00:41:00.23 I don't know where Emily put it and no because then I'll know that no I no I

00:41:05.23 wanna then you'll see 52 and then you'll be like oh first off if we do that I I

00:41:11.05 gotta [ __ ] it's gotta be filmed this is gonna be content

00:41:14.23 that's fair it won't register when it goes 49. No I'm gonna

00:41:21.12 and besides we'll have Gavin Gavin can film it with the phantom and then he can

00:41:25.10 just speed it up to whatever looks like 80 miles an hour

00:41:28.23 you want me to time-lapse you with the fact.

00:41:34.08 I feel like the ball will be going slow enough anyway

00:41:38.13 if if this is something we're into I'm already uh I've already got this going

00:41:42.01 on with my girlfriend we can always turn it into a bit for for the uh

00:41:46.00 eric's into it so I was gonna offer it to you guys if you guys want it to be a

00:41:49.14 thing we would love for it to be a thing I appreciate that it would be like if

00:41:55.07 you watched us a in bolt right it was like I could be three seconds slower like

00:41:59.01 it's ridiculous like what do you mean we should all put in what number we

00:42:02.16 think you're going to throw at and I don't think the phantom should film the

00:42:07.03 ball the phantom should film your face when you look at the speech

00:42:11.16 the uh whoever gets the closest to my actual number

00:42:15.12 uh wins uh wins a thousand swings at baseball bat baseball it'd be awesome

00:42:20.21 I would say you're I don't think throwing is a strength of yours Geoff but

00:42:25.02 flicking you're very good at you're one of the hardest flickers that I've met if

00:42:29.11 that makes you feel good I'm a pretty good thrower I wouldn't I wouldn't have

00:42:34.04 uh I wouldn't have said I could do it if I

00:42:37.04 didn't think I could do it 80 though 80.

00:42:40.03 If I can't throw 80 I can get guy I get goddamn close that means that if a car

00:42:44.18 drove by you at 70 miles an hour you could throw a ball and hit it while it

00:42:48.18 was driving away from you I would assume so yes.

00:42:53.07 I love this I think an important question Geoff how far

00:42:57.07 how far are you willing to train to what extent are you willing to attempt to go

00:43:02.12 for this well I I'll tell you that's a great question Andrew and I'll tell you

00:43:07.12 it's all gonna come down to how much it hurts to throw the baseball the first

00:43:12.12 time once because it is going to hurt a lot like I can't I can like listen I I

00:43:17.14 got issues with his shoulder so I know it's going to be painful first of all uh

00:43:21.12 and so and it is so if I throw it and it doesn't hurt so much and my first throw

00:43:26.03 is like 62 miles an hour or something then I'll be like oh I'll train for a

00:43:29.12 couple weeks if I throw it my arm almost falls off and I throw 48 miles an hour

00:43:33.11 then it's going to be months Eric just said we play baseball on

00:43:37.01 Saturdays you're welcome to join us to see that you absolutely can't throw 80.

00:43:40.12 I'm now rooting for a world where Geoff can throw 80 and he's like the pinch

00:43:44.13 hitter of this baseball team he comes off just closes it out

00:43:48.11 I want to see baseball Geoff if you could throw 80 Geoff uh Eric has to let you

00:43:53.13 throw it at his bruise no way dude I wouldn't hurt him like that Eric how

00:43:57.22 fast is that bull traveling do you think that hit you in the in the water oh

00:44:03.05 man it was going I mean it was a line drive I was probably 40 feet from the

00:44:09.03 plate and it hit me in the thigh so oh god

00:44:12.00 I mean f f fast fast I also don't think I don't think we'll be able to 20. I

00:44:17.03 don't think you could throw 80

00:44:19.05 accurately either not I didn't say I could throw it accurately at all I just

00:44:20.17 don't think you can throw 80 period hold

00:44:24.04 on I'll be right back I gotta let my dog out it's crying what is like our dream

00:44:28.01 gap because we want I wanted to be close enough that Geoff believes he can do it

00:44:33.02 so he does the training I think if he goes if he throws below 40 he's not

00:44:37.14 gonna bother oh there's no way he's gonna bother if it's below 40. I wonder

00:44:42.02 what that number is though maybe if he throws like 6065 it's achievable

00:44:47.07 here's the thing here's the thing like when we go to with mega 64 we would go

00:44:52.05 to fairs and we go to baseball games and Sean who's the most athletic of all

00:44:56.15 those guys big baseball fan he would throw and the hardest he would

00:45:02.13 throw is 69 and his record ever is 72.

00:45:05.19 So when Geoff is telling me that he's going to throw 80 I I'll put a hundred

00:45:09.21 dollars on it that you won't break 75.

00:45:12.12 There's no way we'll see I want to see his pitching form too like

00:45:17.03 is he gonna sprint full speed and then throw the ball like what is his move

00:45:21.09 what is he thinking he's gonna happy gilmore yeah no

00:45:24.21 yeah no I'm gonna I'm gonna pitch like a

00:45:28.05 like a major league baseball player I'll pitch him okay so you're gonna stand

00:45:33.09 you're gonna yeah so what number Geoff does it have to be

00:45:37.01 for you to decide that you think you can

00:45:39.09 do it and train on that first throw oh I think I can do it regardless it's just

00:45:43.12 about how much training and and what the time frame is oh so it's how long of

00:45:47.12 prep you would acquire yeah I'll get to 80 regardless it's just is it gonna take

00:45:51.18 me a month or is it gonna take me six months I don't know

00:45:54.14 okay I think we should give him three months and if he's not at 80 by three

00:45:58.14 months then he can't do it yeah but that three months starts after I throw the

00:46:02.12 first pitch yeah yeah of course the first test the first time I was

00:46:05.18 going to say I feel like we need to make some rules of steroid usage and then

00:46:08.02 I've come to the conclusion I don't think it matters you do whatever you

00:46:11.08 want it doesn't I don't think it will impact if I could if I could get some

00:46:15.16 steroids from my shoulder I would do it in a second not like not like Jose

00:46:19.09 canseco tiny nuts juicing in a [ __ ]

00:46:21.22 in a stall steroids but if I could get some like you know from a doctor that'd

00:46:27.14 be [ __ ] great I need not nickname well that's what happened to him right

00:46:31.16 oh man is that a known fact is that on the right steroids making nuts small

00:46:36.08 yeah where does all the nut flesh go that's I don't know it sucks up in you I

00:46:41.09 guess uh it's wait wait is that a negative I guess less testosterone right tiny

00:46:46.13 little consequence of it yeah I feel like we're just asking

00:46:50.19 his wife I don't know I just I feel like more skin less [Laughter]

00:46:57.20 cosmetically less nut doesn't seem like a bad idea it's not something I'm

00:47:03.06 necessarily opposed to Andrew your nuts too big

00:47:07.00 I don't I don't know what the scale is like you're worried about your nut size

00:47:11.14 aren't you no no I'm not I'm very listen

00:47:13.14 I'm not self-conscious about my nut size at all I'm just saying I don't think

00:47:16.16 that if they were smaller it would be a bad thing have you guys ever measured

00:47:22.06 you know those little like those precise measuring yeah like if you guys

00:47:26.02 ever measured your nuts no what are you gonna just go around the

00:47:29.05 dot like the circumference yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah no not a tape measure but

00:47:32.21 like one of those little like you know what I'm talking about those little like

00:47:36.10 shiny metal tools that they use to to precisely

00:47:39.11 measure like cardboard [ __ ] right yeah you know what I'm talking about I know

00:47:43.07 you mean but in my head it's way funnier if it's like one of those things you

00:47:46.15 measure your foot size in like that's fine too that's fine too yeah as long as

00:47:50.08 you don't smash yourself it seems dangerous all right so we're 45

00:47:54.22 minutes and now we started

00:47:57.12 oh god what was Vegas like it was awesome dude I went I was so I went to

00:48:02.08 Vegas for Andrew to buy him some video games and I was hoping that it would

00:48:07.05 turn into a whole funny adventure that would be great content for this podcast

00:48:12.12 what actually happens happened is uh what took an uber to a

00:48:17.03 used video game store uh that was lovely

00:48:19.08 and the people that worked there uh were

00:48:21.08 very nice and uh so it wasn't in a rough area they were familiar with with

00:48:25.22 rooster teeth and stuff it was in a lovely area nice strip mall really nice

00:48:31.12 store huge tons of stuff and I bought him a copy of fallout new Vegas and a

00:48:36.23 copy of saints row 2 uh factory sealed and uh got a decent price on them and

00:48:40.19 then so I they're in my closet I'll have to figure out how to get them to you uh

00:48:44.15 I guess I'll mail them to you at some point um good luck on that

00:48:48.14 and uh but you Andrew you technically own them they're just in my house in

00:48:52.23 Texas yeah it was it was super easy I was it

00:48:55.12 was happy I was looking so we were gonna go Emily and I were looking for a

00:48:58.23 weekend away we were thinking Chicago to see a white sox game or la to see a

00:49:02.14 dodgers game but we decided to hold off and wait till the playoffs and then just

00:49:07.12 go to Vegas and and it was it was an excuse to go to Vegas uh and bet on

00:49:11.08 sports but also uh it was fun and I was happy to do it and I got to explore

00:49:15.11 Vegas a little bit and I did something in Vegas that I have yet to do I've

00:49:19.18 embarrassed myself in a way that I have yet to embarrass myself I'm so excited

00:49:24.02 what did you do well let me preface this by saying uh

00:49:28.04 if you're training it would be completely different no just to get it

00:49:32.21 out there because it because it you know my life is is is just imbued

00:49:37.12 with feces right oh no so uh I will say yeah just get out of the way yesterday I

00:49:42.02 I barefoot stepped on dog [ __ ] again we squeezed between my big toe and my

00:49:46.19 other toe I got to look down and see poop squeezing between my toes and on on

00:49:50.15 Monday morning I woke up and arrow had

00:49:52.18 [ __ ] the crate so I got to do that again too uh first time she's done it in a

00:49:56.20 while why don't you look down dude yeah great question he's like in an fps game

00:50:02.00 once can't see his feet yeah I was like gold and I what I did

00:50:06.13 in Vegas that was a new embarrassment is had this you know staying at this nice

00:50:11.12 hotel we always stay at a big bathroom I

00:50:14.03 turned the shower on took off my clothes

00:50:16.13 and I was gonna jump into the shower and

00:50:18.14 I thought oh I gotta pee and I froze and

00:50:19.12 I thought I should run to the toilet pee and then I thought I'll just pee in the

00:50:23.03 shower that's you know that's fine whatever uh it's

00:50:26.04 not my shower and so I jumped in the into the into the shower to pee and you

00:50:30.08 know how like when you start peeing it makes you sometimes fart or poop and you

00:50:35.20 can't stop it no Geoff no I had no I had to fart and so I was

00:50:40.10 peeing and I thought ah I just got up I just farted and then I went oh god

00:50:45.09 that's not a fart and I turned and I ran from the shower to the toilet and I

00:50:50.15 [ __ ] all the way to the toilet oh trail a trail of little of little little

00:50:56.17 bloopy turds from the shower all the way to the toilet like a like a like a

00:51:02.02 little snack like a like a like a snail trail of do diarrhea duty because also I

00:51:07.20 don't know what happened to me in Vegas but the second I got to Vegas the

00:51:12.13 diarrhea turned on and it did not turn off until I got back

00:51:16.23 it was like a British guy visiting america after a while

00:51:22.00 I was straight to the toilet and you couldn't stop it

00:51:24.19 no dude you could just hold most of it into it no and I'll be honest with you I

00:51:28.18 didn't know like I felt it and I went like oh that was that felt bad so I

00:51:33.04 turned around to run and then I ran to the toilet and I sat down in the toilet

00:51:37.10 and then I looked up and I saw like what is that on the phone

00:51:40.23 oh no and then I looked around around the door and I saw that I had left the

00:51:44.12 trail yeah yeah yeah

00:51:50.21 oh yeah immediately I was like oh my god

00:51:53.17 you're not gonna believe it I just [ __ ]

00:51:55.16 everywhere yeah she was uh she was horrified

00:51:59.15 I like the not gonna believe it that's the most believable thing I've ever

00:52:03.15 heard I absolutely believe it but this isn't at all surprising that's fair yeah

00:52:08.21 and so I don't even know what to think about that one man because like

00:52:13.12 now I gotta worry about [ __ ] in the shower well I mean if it's diarrhea it's

00:52:18.12 I don't yeah yeah yeah yeah no it was diarrhea

00:52:21.07 it was it was it wasn't it wasn't normal it was dying

00:52:24.05 I don't understand why you're applying locations to this it's farting is the

00:52:28.00 issue wherever you fart will be a problem it's

00:52:31.09 not suddenly a shower issue a piss-pot is different yeah piss fart's different

00:52:37.05 I don't think piss I don't and and honestly and honestly if I had just

00:52:42.00 taken a right instead of a left and gone to the toilet like it's like a like a

00:52:47.01 civilized human I would have just I would have fart dutied into the toilet

00:52:49.03 and it wouldn't have been a problem

00:52:54.04 wait so you ran like an out route like what what do you mean like you didn't

00:52:58.06 run the best path to the toilet or do you mean before no he went to the shower

00:53:01.17 instead of the toilet okay like when I realized I had to pee and I had just

00:53:05.02 gotten naked I thought left in I shower or right to the toilet

00:53:09.09 it's a good thing you sit down and pee it is a good thing

00:53:13.07 I sit down and pee and here's why right as if I needed more uh encouragement to

00:53:19.03 sit and pee this is oh this is that's why in a way because you've like

00:53:23.00 have like my body thinking it's yeah it's safe to fart and [ __ ] while peeing

00:53:28.00 I mean I've trained my anus god damn it you're right how do you

00:53:33.05 untrain an anus or how do you retrain an anus

00:53:38.17 how fast of a ball do you think Geoff's anus could throw her [Laughter]

00:53:46.02 oh man uh Andrew your homework so oh so so

00:53:50.19 I'm pretty sure I have Gavin convinced on this so we were talking about like

00:53:56.04 Eric said no under no circumstances are we allowed to jet ski joust

00:54:01.09 and then he seemed to he seemed he seemed like he was down on the idea

00:54:06.21 of us high fiving in jet skis right so I

00:54:09.18 had another idea that'll make it maybe a

00:54:12.15 little less dangerous I also had another idea about this but you continue

00:54:17.06 so what if we get we still get the sprunk ramp right and we put it in the

00:54:20.13 water but we put in the water kind of near the edge we get another ramp on the

00:54:24.12 edge then one of us is on like Gavin or I get let's say Gavin's on the jet ski

00:54:29.00 I'm on a bicycle right and then so gavin's going like gavin's following the

00:54:33.21 coast and I'm coming at him at a 90

00:54:36.02 degree angle right and then so I hit we both hit ramps at the same time and then

00:54:40.07 in fr I pass in front of him on the jet ski and on my bicycle we high-five in

00:54:45.08 the air then I just fall in the water with the bicycle we pull it out and then

00:54:48.16 he sails off on the jet ski I feel like this is way more dangerous what do you

00:54:52.13 mean what that's what gavin's saying however I as

00:54:55.22 I as I pointed out to Gavin as I pointed out to Gavin who said this seems like a

00:54:59.19 lot it seems dangerous Gavin was scared to death when he got on the jet ski the

00:55:03.16 Gavin that got off the jet ski was a totally different man I'm scared I'm

00:55:08.05 scared to do this too but once we break the trick down into segments and we

00:55:11.16 practice those segments and we get comfortable with those segments and we

00:55:14.19 realize they're not as scary and it was taken individually then we put the whole

00:55:19.02 thing together boom we're set up for success I just don't think that's how it

00:55:22.09 works like the man that got on the jet ski was obviously I I got off way more

00:55:26.15 confident than I got on but I also got off in way more danger because with

00:55:31.16 confidence comes stupidity and danger oh absolutely I

00:55:35.13 told you I felt the gravitational I felt the gravitational pull towards an

00:55:40.13 accident I still do that's gonna happen is it gonna happen here I don't think so

00:55:45.11 I think it'll come in an unexpected way

00:55:48.08 I think when we do the dumb [ __ ] it all it it we it gracefully uh

00:55:52.15 typically goes without a hitch

00:55:56.10 but we're gonna take we're gonna take it

00:55:59.11 in parts it's not like it's like I'm not gonna throw an 80 mile an hour ball

00:56:02.16 tomorrow I'm gonna throw it in like a month or two you don't know that yeah it

00:56:06.23 takes time yeah maybe maybe I will be the eighty miles maybe it maybe I will

00:56:11.08 but you know if I can throw an 80 mile an hour bowl in a month I could probably

00:56:14.13 throw a 90 mile an hour ball in six months who knows okay so I'm going along

00:56:18.08 the coast you're coming in from the coast

00:56:22.10 90 degrees yeah I'm just like I'm coming

00:56:24.22 at you right and am I just holding up my arm so you're just gonna hit the ramp

00:56:28.16 and going like I don't know not too fast oh god or whatever in the air yeah so

00:56:34.00 you hit the ramp you go up and as I see you're coming I hit my ramp ahead of you

00:56:37.23 so that I pass in front of you and then I kind of reach my right arm back as I

00:56:42.21 go and then as you're coming in you reach your arm out and then we just like

00:56:46.21 we just tap each other's hands and then I fi then I fall into the water and I

00:56:50.12 have to drag a bike out I have the hard job you just sail off what happens when

00:56:55.16 when you're mid-air you're reaching back and suddenly your front tire is

00:57:00.15 heading for my forehead why would we do that so you move

00:57:04.09 oh you move your forehead oh that's a great point that's a great point you

00:57:07.15 just move Gavin also a little practice so that we'll practice so that that part

00:57:12.10 doesn't happen well I'm on the jet there's no practice on this you do this once

00:57:17.14 yeah we're good we're gonna listen we'll practice well it's gonna be fun I did I

00:57:23.05 did the stupid bike trick a thousand times for Gavin

00:57:26.22 we're going to have to do this a few times before we get the right shot

00:57:31.03 those are comparable those are very different level of things

00:57:34.23 I don't think we can even do what you're describing in gta

00:57:40.08 I think we can and maybe that's some maybe that's some supplementary content

00:57:44.23 for the site we'll put that on YouTube we'll plan it out in gta and if we can

00:57:49.12 do it in gta then we'll try it in the real world yeah let's do a gta video

00:57:54.21 if we can't do it within an hour we don't bother in real life

00:57:58.12 I think we can work up to this and more so what's my homework

00:58:02.09 that's a great point yeah you're right you're right Gavin and

00:58:05.02 I were talking about how to how to better incorporate you into the jet ski

00:58:08.09 stuff since you're in Canada and how do we really leverage andrew's greatest

00:58:14.02 strengths right and I think you're you're like ultimate uh like super power

00:58:18.01 you're you're like you're like x-ray superman x-ray vision right or he he ray

00:58:23.05 vision is is getting free [ __ ] from corporations so all we need you to do is

00:58:29.05 is reach out to sidoo or yamaha or any other but ideally cdu via social media

00:58:34.20 and get them to donate or give us or sponsor face with an official with an

00:58:39.02 official [ __ ] face jet ski that that they can provide for us it'd be great if

00:58:43.14 it had the logo on it but it doesn't have to supreme sold a jet ski we can

00:58:48.19 I'm gonna transcribe how you describe the stunt you want to do word

00:58:52.05 for word and just email that to every see new company I could find well maybe

00:58:56.15 see if we have any takers listen we need lit that's not going to get us anywhere

00:59:01.07 we need we need you to do your your Andrew best can I can I propose my my

00:59:05.14 kind of cross idea I had about this I was thinking about this stunt too it

00:59:10.02 doesn't involve the ramp I forgot about the whole ramp I'm already I like this

00:59:13.15 better but this is so combining of ideas because I talked about doing doing the

00:59:18.14 jet ski jousting which I think still would be did you see the the image

00:59:22.18 somebody made yes by the way I still think it's a good idea did you see it

00:59:26.16 Gavin yeah you guys could do it no I didn't see it here I'll post it right

00:59:29.21 now it was made by I believe someone named new york on on the subreddit look

00:59:33.12 at it you can't tell me this doesn't look [ __ ] cool you wouldn't watch

00:59:37.04 that great but the framework for that is both of us with a pull through our

00:59:42.02 hearts what are you talking about put a tennis ball on the end of the pole or

00:59:47.02 something so this is my idea kind of a cross

00:59:50.05 between the two we get the jousting sticks right you guys both just gonna

00:59:55.16 die no no no no no no trust me this mine

00:59:58.21 is so much safer we get giant foam hands and we duct tape them

01:00:03.12 to the ends of the jousting sticks you guys high five with the foam hands going

01:00:08.06 past each other why do you it doesn't matter I love that idea the stick the

01:00:11.22 stick is going through someone no no no you're not aiming at each other you're

01:00:15.21 aiming at a middle point between the two and they're going to cross and hit each

01:00:19.23 other so they're slapping in the middle yeah it is a distance high five using

01:00:24.18 the combining the adjusting idea I think this is the safest thing approach I

01:00:28.15 think this is viable I think that's great what we're going to

01:00:32.04 need though is the sea doos so we need you to work

01:00:35.22 we and here's the thing we're going to do once we have

01:00:39.12 once we have the jet skis yeah but we need our own jet skis I can't keep

01:00:44.17 renting them once you've once you've secured once you've secured jet skis for

01:00:49.02 us Andrew via your android powers uh then we can we can escalate we can do

01:00:53.21 all manner all manner of tricks we're gonna be we when you I would like face

01:00:58.19 uh to be synonymous with the word or the hyphenate jet ski I want I I like the

01:01:04.02 two go together like peanut butter and jelly like when you hear jet ski

01:01:09.01 immediately you think oh obviously face the jet ski guys so we'll do we'll

01:01:14.00 there'll be a million different uh cool tricks and stunts and stuff we can work

01:01:17.20 on okay so we'd say we're definitely not a baseball podcast but 100 a jet ski

01:01:22.21 podcast we're just that's what we are we're jetski

01:01:26.10 that's Eric saying we're not a baseball podcast I just I'm just repeating what

01:01:30.02 he said how fast can you throw a jet ski I know how fast I can drive one

01:01:35.06 I'm just excited I'm excited for these emails Andrew when do you think you

01:01:37.11 could get some uh when do you think you can get going on this would you do you

01:01:40.14 think you'd have news for us by next week oh without a doubt could I send

01:01:44.21 them by next week will I get a response you know we'll see we just just need

01:01:49.01 ideas doing free jet ski ideally two jet skis but if we could get one we'll make

01:01:53.00 it work wait what do you mean if we get if we

01:01:55.15 only get one you mean like you'll rent the other there's nothing yeah we'll

01:01:58.14 we'll make it work maybe yeah we'll figure it I see I got it okay

01:02:02.10 I just wanted to make sure you weren't gonna try to like reduce the stunt into

01:02:07.05 both being on the same jet ski somehow and doing this in some way complicated

01:02:12.06 version of something that would result in your death I think also in in in

01:02:17.18 since we're going all in on jet skis and jet ski related content here at face

01:02:22.03 which by the way if you haven't seen gavin's slo-mo jet ski uh video it is up

01:02:25.23 on uh YouTube and I think on the Instagram that's not the stunt though

01:02:29.15 that's that's how they start that's just that's the same level as the bike stud

01:02:33.07 just so you can get your hopes exp no I just I just I just wanted to catch

01:02:38.13 the joy of gavin's first jet ski well my girlfriend did I didn't but yeah

01:02:42.19 is there an award show for like stunts can we somehow like can we submit a

01:02:46.17 stunt as stunt of the year is there like an oscars for stunts there's like some

01:02:51.05 sort of stunt festival we could take yeah I feel like that that should be a

01:02:54.15 thing we pursue I don't know what exists so since we're going all in on jet skis

01:02:59.01 I think we're gonna have some jet ski related merchandise too like floaty key

01:03:02.19 rings and uh those like things to hold your glasses your oakleys on so you

01:03:07.09 don't lose them when you fly off the jet ski you know like

01:03:10.20 like legit jet ski related uh helpful merch can we do a thing Geoff where we

01:03:16.06 sell toy jet skis and one person just gets a real jet ski yeah why not

01:03:20.23 as long as they fit in the same container you know how you had that

01:03:24.00 laminated card in your wallet with all the roman numerals on what if we just

01:03:27.12 had little laminated instructions to flip a jet ski back over

01:03:35.11 it's very easy to do you got 60 seconds to do it takes you about 30 seconds to

01:03:40.15 flip it over gravity's gonna do all the work for you

01:03:44.03 Taurus world stunt awards so this is the thing oh they got a cool trophy

01:03:49.07 oh we gotta look into how what is the requirements to to qualify for submit

01:03:54.07 submission voting this is exciting hey uh Gavin free yeah before we end this
