00:00:00.03 [Music]

00:00:07.22 [Music]

00:00:15.11 Can I tell you my super lame watch the throne idea I've had for a long time I

00:00:20.21 always thought as when I was younger I always thought it was would be such a

00:00:25.14 [ __ ] cool thing if somebody who is a champion

00:00:27.22 of like a boxing champion or like an mma

00:00:30.09 fighter champion defended their album to the entire watch the throne cd and then

00:00:34.06 retired at the end of it like every defense was a different song of watch

00:00:37.19 the throne and then they were tired at the end that would be sick that was my

00:00:43.07 like fan fiction for boxing man that's not written fan fiction for boxing it's

00:00:47.07 essentially fan fiction for boxing and I mean I'm not writing it down but it's

00:00:50.10 the same idea of like as a kid being like this is [ __ ] this would be cool

00:00:55.18 imagine someone did this man hello hi Gavin hey what's up hi Geoff what's up

00:01:00.02 hey what's up let's talk about music I know listening to a lot of Vanessa

00:01:05.03 Carlton recently and there's a whole thing

00:01:07.01 Annie is just a ripoff of my bittersweet

00:01:09.05 symphony at least part of it is it's odd it's a fascinating one banes

00:01:13.15 accidentally steal songs from each other but bittersweet symphony's a ripoff

00:01:18.02 sometimes they on purpose steal songs from each other I I present to you the

00:01:22.05 entirety of led zeppelin that's that's fair what do you mean by my bittersweet

00:01:27.10 symphony was is that a thing are you [ __ ] with me

00:01:30.02 are you asking about bittersweet symphony yeah I feel like you could be

00:01:33.12 peter stir marrying me right now I feel this feels very strong where no I don't

00:01:38.20 quite have it's like a weird instrumental version of like a rolling

00:01:44.04 stone song that they which also leaves the door open to be stolen

00:01:48.10 from somebody else so we might not be able to track

00:01:51.10 didn't didn't they the origin of it was that the song bittersweet symphony and

00:01:55.16 you'll I'll have to apologize I'm not I wasn't super into that kind of music

00:01:58.16 at that time so I don't know it very well but wasn't that the song that they

00:02:01.14 ended up losing all their [ __ ]

00:02:03.05 royalties to the rolling stones over I don't know yeah I don't know anything

00:02:06.21 about it yeah it wasn't making yeah I thought it was a u2 song well I

00:02:11.20 think at some point they I think they gave it back to the uh the verve guy hmm

00:02:17.00 oh like we don't know they gave the royalties back a couple years is that

00:02:19.22 like a power move I feel like we don't need this song you can have it oh like

00:02:23.11 we've made all the money on it now uh yeah you know we're about to die so feel

00:02:27.03 free yeah I don't think I can name three rolling stone socks

00:04:36.13 united states 68

00:04:38.02 uk whoa 11

00:04:41.11 Canada nine wow we've got we've got the top three yeah not bad

00:04:46.17 representing our our respective countries

00:04:49.12 I don't why can't it a guy what did you say forget it it felt wordy mine well

00:04:54.13 here's why I said here's what what I said I said Canadian exists you know

00:04:59.12 what if you get Canada into second place I'll call you a Canadian but until then

00:05:03.00 you're just a Canada guy at nine percent eleven percent get you uh get you the

00:05:07.11 proper nomenclature okay I can live with

00:05:09.19 that I'm gonna I'm gonna figure this out I'm gonna somehow work the system new

00:05:15.01 Zealand one percent yeah well I wonder who that person is

00:05:19.17 that's pretty high a whole percent for tiny little new Zealand it's not even on

00:05:23.14 most of the maps yeah we also have one percent in Ireland I didn't expect that

00:05:28.12 what an exciting time what place would you least like the

00:05:32.13 visit that's on this list okay yes so should we okay should we go

00:05:36.12 through the so the list is united states

00:05:38.08 united kingdom Canada Australia which by the way thanks Australia six percent

00:05:42.02 appreciate it new Zealand Sweden Ireland Netherlands Norway Germany there's one

00:05:47.20 place I've never been to on that list really oh let's guess uh

00:05:52.16 came up in conversation in a recent episode

00:05:55.18 uh there's two in my mind that are very like obviously bottom tier

00:06:00.04 I'm just judging other countries just by name just by name I feel like

00:06:06.17 my perception of Norway is that they're always in the Olympics but they always

00:06:12.00 place like seventh there's a shitty olympic performance no

00:06:16.02 but like good enough to like they're there they're on the first graphic

00:06:19.23 typically but I I feel like I rarely see in Norway win

00:06:23.20 that is the one country I've never been to there we go Norway

00:06:26.22 I was trying to figure out why because I've like I'd love to go there though

00:06:30.15 we've been to Germany together we've been to the Netherlands together we've

00:06:36.00 been to Australia the uk we have been to america together yeah okay

00:06:40.09 yeah the Mexican restaurant conversation that's right

00:06:44.18 chickpeas and chickpeas and uh celery in the burrito yeah in Norway

00:06:49.11 I feel like of all the countries listed I'm most likely to get lost in the

00:06:54.15 Netherlands there's just something about the name that I don't trust myself in

00:06:59.13 I think if I went to the Netherlands I wouldn't come back alive I think I would

00:07:04.11 die in the Netherlands [Laughter]

00:07:07.16 for what I don't I don't no I don't know I just I don't trust myself in the

00:07:12.03 Netherlands how are you gonna die from their socialized medicine and superior

00:07:16.05 healthcare no I'm sure it's a great actual place but there's something

00:07:20.08 do you ever just like this is gonna sound [ __ ] crazy do you

00:07:24.23 ever look at a thing and then process a whole scenario in

00:07:27.23 your head that could play out that won't like I could just see when I look at

00:07:31.17 Netherlands I process a world in which I

00:07:34.23 am dead by the end of my trip three days it's pretty severe catastrophizing

00:07:40.11 I had that recently with a with a seal I saw a seal

00:07:43.04 I saw a photo of a seal in a hole you just thought I'll lose that fight no no

00:07:47.10 well so I asked like so it was this it was like a gif of a seal like poking its

00:07:51.16 head up and down from hole and it was like oh look at how cute the seal is and

00:07:55.14 I thought well if I was there I would be I respect animals they're

00:07:59.08 [ __ ] they're terrifying to me I once had a panic attack with my cat like you

00:08:04.08 got to be aware and the [ __ ] animals are a crazy thing um

00:08:07.09 so I was like well what [ __ ] like what would I have done

00:08:10.17 they're like oh this is cute and my head I'd be like we gotta [ __ ] go I was

00:08:14.18 curious do seals their seals attack seals can attack seals can be [ __ ]

00:08:18.21 vicious and they're fast they are apparently messed with the zoo I if I

00:08:23.03 would [ __ ] run so fast and then I had this whole moment I played out this

00:08:26.04 whole scenario in my head if I was in that fishing hole I would have been

00:08:29.11 killed by that seal that seal would have destroyed me I would have been eaten by

00:08:33.03 that so so your version of Luke Skywalker in empire strikes back in the dagobah

00:08:38.15 system going through the swamp and confronting his darkest fear which is

00:08:43.18 himself as darth vader uh your version of that is a vacation to an aquarium in

00:08:48.16 in the Netherlands it would be the end of me yeah cause I know I would run away

00:08:52.09 and I guess you're not supposed to I guess seals like the chase things so

00:08:55.20 then I could just see the seal chasing after me it was this whole thing I went

00:09:00.02 to the bathroom and I googled seal teeth on my phone and I just said [ __ ] that

00:09:05.18 when I found I'll post this photo I was looking I was like [ __ ] this

00:09:09.12 I'm [ __ ] I'm dead I'm dead if I encounter a seal like a bobbed teeth

00:09:14.05 yeah I don't want to [ __ ] deal with that oh that sounds terrible it's just

00:09:18.17 gonna chase me it's really cool that looks like a recipe for a broken tooth

00:09:22.19 how do they hold on to that I did Eric asked how are they going to chase me and

00:09:26.06 land they strike me as very slippery creatures they got some movement to them

00:09:30.16 like you know it's a [ __ ] crocodile alligator whatever it is they're faster

00:09:35.09 than you'd think mm-hmm or a snake you wouldn't think a snake it

00:09:39.22 out I'd like to see a seal go down your slip inside oh my sim and glide

00:09:45.13 zim and glide get the products yes it's very different from the slipped

00:09:50.23 side zoom and glide um I have a thing that I'd like to talk to

00:09:55.04 you guys about that okay real fast before you do that yeah go

00:09:59.07 ahead can I just say something sure this was a happy new year happy new year

00:10:04.04 it's our first recording since the since

00:10:07.02 the new year I believe so happy it is it is almost like the latest we could

00:10:10.17 possibly go yeah we're almost seven days in um

00:10:15.07 what was I going to say [ __ ] I'm now you have a thing

00:10:20.15 I'm saying oh it happened it happened new year's eve the thing I'm going to

00:10:26.00 talk about ooh I was triple x oh I wish what did oh I

00:10:29.14 should have watched all of them there's three of them now I could have done a

00:10:33.16 whole night it's a great trilogy by the way uh I'm gonna

00:10:37.18 how do I want to set this up I'm gonna post this email

00:10:41.08 and then I'll just I'll have one of you read it I'll have you know I'll have

00:10:45.18 Gavin I'll have you read this I woke up on Saturday morning

00:10:49.06 and I'd received this and it is maybe the most I feel I have faced myself in a

00:10:54.01 long time it's been a while I'm going to send this to you

00:10:58.08 feel free to read it Kevin you'd say the name

00:11:01.12 read the name of the person and read read the text

00:11:06.10 and do it out loud okay an email from new year's eve from Kevin Donovan

00:11:11.20 to Andrew pen ton the email reads sure I'd be happy to

00:11:15.07 that's the director of the tuxedo [Laughter]

00:11:21.12 oh no that was my reaction Gavin oh no oh no I woke up.

00:11:30.17 I woke up Saturday morning and looked at my phone and groggily said oh no

00:11:37.16 sure I'd be happy to so we have recorded and I'm I'm not sure

00:11:42.12 if it'll be out at this time but we did a commentary for the movie the tuxedo

00:11:48.12 because it's the movie that Gavin was most disappointed by from watching the

00:11:53.18 trailer to seeing the final film but if you but you knew

00:11:57.12 that and you thought hey I'll get the director involved well I just

00:12:02.10 listened there were two yeah for failure no we'll get to that so

00:12:07.12 I reached out before and I didn't I didn't expect see I saw

00:12:11.12 this the way I wrote the email was like hey do you have any stories or

00:12:16.10 anecdotes or anything that you could share because I thought it'd be funny if

00:12:21.07 during the commentary track I could be like hey I talked to the director that's

00:12:26.13 a weird random thing this is something he had he had to say about it um

00:12:31.02 that was my plan we have since recorded that commentary we're not kind in a lot

00:12:36.04 of different ways absolutely nothing personal against the

00:12:40.21 guy just fuc the tuxedo is not a good movie um

00:12:43.21 so going down um well I'm doubling down on that it's not a good movie I'm not

00:12:47.14 saying it's his subjective I don't think it's his fault I'm not

00:12:51.03 saying he's at fault for it but he's he's directed one film and it's the

00:12:55.04 tuxedo and I like I don't know his relationship as far as I can tell he's

00:12:59.01 never talked about the tuxedo post tuxedo so I don't know what his feelings

00:13:03.08 are on it overall it's an experience and who knows this [ __ ] making a good

00:13:08.00 anything is really difficult so yeah what if he doesn't like it well

00:13:11.11 it could be like a mic judge idiocracy type thing where the studio got so or

00:13:16.08 like run running running the studio got so involved like he had a brilliant

00:13:20.10 Jackie chan movie and then the studio got involved he's a first-time director

00:13:24.12 and they [ __ ] they they all like put their fingers in the pie and ended up

00:13:27.18 muddying it all up so uh that's the possibility I will say

00:13:32.04 the one thing against that is I believe on his website he refers to the tuxedo

00:13:36.10 as a kung fu movie classic uh which would lead me to believe that he has his

00:13:42.06 favorable opinions about okay well when did the movie come out

00:13:48.08 2002 maybe so so 19 years ago and people are still making podcasts about it that

00:13:51.21 sounds like a classic to me buddy

00:13:54.23 so what if we did a commentary with him on our commentary

00:14:00.17 we're doing a second well this is let's I got to progress this story so I look

00:14:05.19 at this email and to me I interpret this as he has

00:14:10.05 interpreted my original email as saying that like I want to interview him or

00:14:15.08 talk to him more extensively I was I thought this would go one of two ways

00:14:19.15 either he wouldn't reply at all or he would reply and be like oh when we

00:14:23.18 did this like this happened like a little story about the movie I never

00:14:27.08 considered the possibility of it being interpreted as like an interview which

00:14:31.01 I'd love to do I would love to have an interview with Kevin Donovan and I was

00:14:34.07 hoping that that could even possibly I could come in here today and be like I

00:14:37.09 recorded an interview with the director of the tuxedo and talk to you guys about

00:14:40.21 that I feel like I should be up front with

00:14:43.14 him on how much we shout on his movie so he could be mean to us that's the

00:14:47.14 dilemma Kevin because I want to be kind to Kevin like I have nothing against

00:14:53.09 Kevin Donovan I'm sure he's a great guy but

00:14:56.23 I would feel so disingenuous writing this like with yeah

00:15:00.04 to be honest maintaining this very kind tone which I have like on a human level

00:15:06.00 for Kevin Donovan but at the same time I feel like such a

00:15:10.04 [ __ ] being like hey nice to meet you thanks for replying we thought your

00:15:15.11 movie [ __ ] sucked it was terrible um but I'd love to talk more with you

00:15:20.19 please that'd be great like what do I do like what is I felt so

00:15:24.14 faced and like I don't know you faced yourself there's no good way out of this

00:15:28.06 there's zero good way out of it the upside the only saving grace is that we

00:15:32.12 had a great time watching it and maybe

00:15:35.01 he'll be happy with that but we did [ __ ]

00:15:37.11 on it we showed it a lot it was a lot I do like the idea of doing a director's

00:15:42.14 commentary on our commentary like I like the idea of getting him

00:15:47.18 involved and having him do what I wonder what the most nested

00:15:52.12 uh a series of commentaries over a property is like what if we just did a

00:15:57.15 commentary we did a commentary over our over our tuxedo commentary and then like

00:16:02.02 every two months we just do another commentary on top of that I I think it's

00:16:05.17 really funny if we go forever if we have a more extensive bonus feature section

00:16:10.07 for the tuxedo than the release of the tuxedo had like what we're offering is

00:16:14.12 better than the dvd final package um what was in the dvd bonus stuff gap

00:16:19.22 because you were a big fan of commentaries and bonus features and stuff

00:16:24.19 well on movies during the time where they were like interactive [Laughter]

00:16:29.16 you remember that like when DVDs were coming out they put that as a feature

00:16:34.00 interactive menu you could click stuff like that some

00:16:37.22 dvd menus would go all out they would they would put so much effort and some

00:16:42.17 would just be like text on a on a plain background I have never cared about a

00:16:47.06 dvd menu we used to go out of our mind when we would make those red versus blue

00:16:52.13 DVDs they were clouds piling on extra features and easter eggs we would have

00:16:56.16 like 40 or 50 easter eggs per dvd just tons of [ __ ] yeah you know you go to

00:17:00.21 like chapter select and then like chapter five to eight and then press

00:17:04.00 down and it would like take you to a secret it's cool stuff like that

00:17:08.00 there are some cool things that is cool that is awesome I I don't

00:17:11.19 like the ones where like it would be a sequence and then they'd loop you back

00:17:15.13 like your menu would freeze for a second and then restart the sequence

00:17:20.17 I don't want a freezing menu right I think I think for a first-time director

00:17:25.06 who was working with a lot of money and some of the biggest stars in the world

00:17:29.18 at the time uh and he he pulled it off and and I'm

00:17:33.12 just I'm just I'm disappointed in how hateful you both are towards this

00:17:38.17 which I I don't remember expressing anything any discontent with at all yeah

00:17:44.09 I could I count myself a fan of Kevin Donovan and I bought you 10 grand you

00:17:49.22 didn't that's the other concern with this is I

00:17:53.03 don't remember specifically what we said in the commentary track like I can't

00:17:58.15 I don't know what I'm defending fully yeah

00:18:01.15 I don't remember exactly what we said I just know we were treating it very much

00:18:05.17 like the director wasn't listening to us yes and never would

00:18:10.10 absolutely not that we would we would contact him and make ourselves known to

00:18:14.10 him as we were doing it um so I was that was my dilemma I woke up

00:18:18.23 Saturday both excited that holy [ __ I I can't believe Kevin Donovan actually

00:18:22.20 replied what how do I how do I reply to this and I had the same dilemma as Gavin

00:18:27.23 brought up of like I feel like if I'm just super nice I can immediately get

00:18:32.08 this done but that feels super wrong and disingenuous and I need to how do I

00:18:36.05 approach how do you tell someone that the thing the one movie they made you

00:18:39.14 thought was really bad this might be one of the rare scenarios

00:18:43.16 where being nice is the meanest you could be

00:18:48.04 that's a great way of looking at it um so I replied I will okay oh god

00:18:52.22 I wrote back on Monday and then I had this realization because

00:18:56.12 it took a few days obviously there was some time period between when I sent it

00:19:00.06 and when it arrived I had the realization that it is so classically us

00:19:04.12 that I like in the original email I didn't really say anything about what

00:19:08.01 our show was or or what kind of the tone of it is

00:19:11.07 just that we we're doing a thing with the tuxedo I'd love to tell the name

00:19:16.05 no I don't think I did in the first email um well

00:19:19.19 without a direct link our podcast is impossible to find so we're probably

00:19:24.04 safe yeah well well I sent that in the second email I provided a direct link

00:19:29.18 and damn it Andrew I provided provided a direct link and

00:19:33.22 then I had the realization that by the time he probably gets around

00:19:37.15 to looking at that email if he were to decide like I'm gonna give this show a

00:19:41.23 chance the episode he would listen to is the most broken and chaotic

00:19:46.20 think about the one that came out on Wednesday this past Wednesday the one

00:19:50.02 where I tried to print the law and everything broke down that will be his

00:19:55.18 introduction to the show well apparently according to almost every

00:20:00.03 comment I saw on that episode it's the best one we've ever done

00:20:05.03 so maybe we're lucky people [ __ ] loved that I oh my lord I

00:20:09.16 thought it was a train wreck but I like that we came away from that thinking we

00:20:15.18 had 18 minutes of andrew's earlier uh nick how how many minutes did we

00:20:20.13 actually have oh we had most of the backup but zero of

00:20:24.08 the raw recording right so zero so okay thank you for bringing that up pivot

00:20:30.15 away from Kevin Donovan for a moment I meant to mention this I forgot I did

00:20:36.08 there was a point time in which I was back in and I could hear you guys

00:20:39.21 talking but I couldn't talk at all but I could hear everything you all were

00:20:43.06 saying and I I felt like there was a point which Gavin was snitching on me

00:20:47.01 for pausing my recording the previous week in a panic and then dragging back

00:20:50.23 on yeah I heard that or I caught the tail end of that and then Gavin you made

00:20:55.14 a point where you were like why didn't why didn't we just pause for like three

00:20:59.19 minutes have Andrew reboot his computer and then just get on so this would be

00:21:03.13 fine it takes like 20 minutes for my computer to reboot but I was so annoyed

00:21:08.00 with you I was like [ __ ] you don't think I'd [ __ ] okay I'm gonna [ __ ]

00:21:12.02 Reset it and I'll reply in an hour when it turns back on so I start holding down

00:21:16.16 the power button on my computer while everything's [ __ ] broken and then I

00:21:22.04 remembered I haven't saved that we did two episodes that was the second

00:21:26.21 I did not save the recording for my first one because it takes like 10

00:21:30.11 minutes to save and we're going back to back so I'm holding the power button and

00:21:35.10 then I realized that I haven't saved my first recording I'm gonna lose it if I

00:21:40.04 turn my machine off so then I let go of the power button and I spent the next 15

00:21:44.21 minutes frantically trying to save before the chain of events realized that

00:21:49.02 it was supposed to turn my computer off and I was just a frantic mess behind the

00:21:54.08 scenes trying to just make sure I didn't

00:21:57.01 lose literally all my audio I'd given up on that recording being useful but I

00:22:00.21 also almost punted away the perfectly fine recording for the first one we did

00:22:05.09 on that day oh Andrew what oh yeah I'm just reading one except

00:22:09.18 I can understand what he's saying oh he's yeah he was nick was terrified

00:22:14.00 my heart was beating fast too nick well if your computer wasn't choking on the

00:22:19.01 law I assume it would have rebooted oh it would have died so quickly yeah

00:22:24.15 saved by the law it was I was saved by the law here's what I'll

00:22:27.16 say about Kevin Donovan uh I I don't know how this is gonna end

00:22:31.22 I assume you're not done Andrew with the story and that it'll probably go

00:22:36.23 somewhere but I will say and I I had a light bulb moment just now uh if things

00:22:42.00 don't go well with Kevin Donovan mm-hmm what we have what we will have

00:22:46.19 is our first enemy of face no and that's one of the enemies

00:22:49.22 that's uh I don't I don't either but he might want to be enemies with you and

00:22:53.11 there's nothing I can do about that and if he's an enemy with you then he's an

00:22:56.12 enemy of us because we're a team right so I'm just saying there could be like a

00:23:01.11 [ __ ] face list of uh faced haters and he might just be

00:23:05.05 number one on it think of like this no no we're not it's it's bound to happen

00:23:10.12 at some point right I I know we I I know you've you've already run a foul of the

00:23:15.18 of the legal lawyer people by continuing to to hide on their system for a long

00:23:19.12 time emails occasionally I don't I don't count them as friends of

00:23:24.03 the podcast so oh I think they're friends yeah no I'm I'm part of I'm

00:23:28.00 involved with I'm there I'm in there comfy okay are you talking about the

00:23:32.23 lawyers or the judges the judges the judges yeah yeah I still get emails from

00:23:38.06 hire judge.com what is a judge Gavin but a lawyer who got a promotion [Laughter]

00:23:42.21 because I think we're enemies with both I think we're also anyways with two

00:23:46.07 [ __ ]

00:23:51.07 Um so I replied I replied to Kevin Donovan and I I wrote like first the first

00:23:57.03 section of it was very sweet I'm not gonna read the email but it was like

00:24:01.23 very much like it's so nice to hear from you thank you so much for getting back

00:24:07.16 to us and then the second the second part yeah the second part is the pivot

00:24:13.01 of I just want to be upfront with you because I would feel wrong doing so

00:24:16.06 otherwise we made a fun of the tuxedo quite a bit we made a lot of jokes I

00:24:20.15 said something like that along the lines this is where I probably made another

00:24:25.20 mistake was uh I I know I was very I was very polite I feel like

00:24:30.10 I wrote as kind of like a hey we [ __ ] on

00:24:33.11 this thing that you worked on as I could I felt like I needed to show

00:24:39.11 that I was I ca I don't know this is a weird like I had to put something on the

00:24:44.19 line I had to put stakes on the line so I was like if you have any questions uh

00:24:49.21 feel free to email me back here or you can text me at this number and I

00:24:55.01 gave them Kevin Donovan has my personal cell phone number

00:24:59.11 so he can just text me at any point you have so many different phone numbers

00:25:04.21 why did you give him your real personal one because I've I I don't know it just

00:25:08.17 seemed like I wanted to be like listen I'm coming from a genuine place this

00:25:13.10 feels so much if I was in his position I think it would feel like a trap or that

00:25:17.06 has been text surely you wouldn't even bother like if someone says hey we shout

00:25:21.18 on your movie feel free to text me like it's a helpline like what do you what

00:25:25.22 are you expecting him to do I don't I just like that is a personal

00:25:29.20 thing that could go wrong like I felt like I was wagering something at that

00:25:34.10 point like I was putting something of value on the thing you were

00:25:38.04 giving something back I watched this movie like not hey

00:25:44.04 and I want to be friends with you to the point where I'm letting you have

00:25:49.14 personal direct access to me whenever you want

00:25:52.14 we shouldn't let you talk to people no I'm great at talking with people I got

00:25:57.12 I'm talking to Kevin I'm talking to Kevin Donovan it was the timing issue it

00:26:02.23 wasn't uh talking to people issue so between Kevin Donovan I start a new

00:26:08.13 podcast called fucksedo and I just [ __ ]

00:26:11.09 on our podcast for an hour every week that'd be really funny

00:26:14.02 I'd actually like that a lot I I still don't you're acting like oh no

00:26:19.01 look what's happened it's unfortunate you still reached out to him in the

00:26:23.01 first place knowing that we didn't

00:26:28.00 before we recorded it yeah but we already didn't like the movie but you

00:26:32.07 knew you didn't like it it's like hey cosmic crisp we love your apples I want

00:26:36.08 to talk to you hey Kevin Donovan your movie stinks I want to talk I have more

00:26:41.20 anger with cosmic crisp than tuxedo but um the tuxedo I was open to liking I

00:26:46.00 remember watching it as a kid and not being the biggest fan of it but I went

00:26:49.12 in hopeful that I would have a better experience and I have a great

00:26:53.22 conversation because I named it as my most disappointed I've

00:26:57.20 ever yeah but I don't always I don't agree with every [ __ ] opinion Gavin

00:27:01.09 free has why am I why my opinion is is more valid or important I'm just saying

00:27:05.22 that's how it came up that's not that's not the reason to reach out to the

00:27:09.14 people who made it yeah but you have ridiculous opinions about the new matrix

00:27:13.01 movie too so I don't know how to evaluate your movie texts could be wrong

00:27:17.21 you don't know man [Music]

00:27:19.18 did Kevin call or text you I have not heard back from Kevin Donovan since I

00:27:25.20 replied with my phone number and uh that episode has released you sound like a

00:27:30.12 [ __ ] stalker that's probably yeah it's like hey Kevin let's hang out

00:27:32.15 here's my number give me a call if you want to no where do you live by the way

00:27:36.05 what's your address would you mind if I came visited you do what do you like for

00:27:40.21 lunch I'll bring sandwiches no it was a nicely written email

00:27:44.09 I think I don't know I would be I'd be surprised if we hear back but I'm

00:27:48.04 hopeful I have questions for like I genuinely have questions about that

00:27:51.21 movie I want to know why James brown is in it I want to know if there's a list

00:27:55.21 of suit functions that they didn't cover

00:27:58.05 are there any edited suit scenes what is it like working with Jackie chan cause

00:28:02.09 like he openly hates all of his American movies that must be a weird thing

00:28:06.14 I would want to know cause these things always happen on film sets right you

00:28:10.13 work intensely together for months and months and months uh I wonder like what

00:28:14.15 lifelong friendships he he built in the process of making that film like are he

00:28:18.12 and Jackie chan's are he and Jackie chan's close and they still send each

00:28:21.13 other Christmas cards you know yeah does he have Jackie chan's phone number it's

00:28:25.14 funny you mentioned that he filmed a commercial with Jackie chan in like 2018

00:28:29.14 I want to say maybe a bit earlier so he has done a can like he he didn't stop

00:28:33.16 there there there could be Jackie chan remembered him oh yeah yeah I do

00:28:40.06 um Kevin Donovan I hope I hope I get a reply back I'd

00:28:44.21 love to hear from Kevin Donovan what questions do you guys have any

00:28:48.18 questions you would like to ask ask did Kevin Donovan yeah

00:28:53.05 what did you think when you heard when you received this initial con email

00:28:58.01 or contact from Andrew and what do you think now

00:29:00.19 you guys are going to do your own Kevin Donovan interview about his interaction

00:29:04.20 with me are you Eric said are you mad at us

00:29:08.13 well yeah here's why here's my question for Kevin Donovan will you accept my

00:29:13.11 apology [Laughter]

00:29:17.20 I was very excited about that I was excited to bring that to the show I wish

00:29:22.11 that uh in my head it would have been really

00:29:25.00 funny if I had an interview with Kevin Donovan as well but I just hope he

00:29:28.16 doesn't hate us it's where I currently stand with Kevin Donovan I'm just I'm

00:29:32.03 glad you're honest with him well I kind of wish you'd never

00:29:35.14 talk to him in the first place yeah truly honest but why

00:29:40.08 why why dean why why because now we have a hate list and he's at the top of it

00:29:46.02 and now we have a competitive podcast on the way out called the fucksedo that's

00:29:49.18 just gonna [ __ ] on us all day long.

00:29:52.15 I would genuinely love to have a talk Kevin Donovan I I'm more as I said I'm

00:29:57.16 more upset with cosmic crisp than I am Kevin Kevin Donna and tuxedo I think

00:30:02.19 they're a bigger rival to us I don't know

00:30:04.21 I don't know what that means why are you upset with cosmic Chris who by the way

00:30:08.12 should cut us in on their apple profits because we have sold so many [ __ ]

00:30:12.01 apples for those people not only that Geoff that's why so I'm getting getting

00:30:15.13 into it I've been sent screen shots of [ __ ] cosmic Chris promoting YouTube

00:30:19.15 content promo they're out there promoting content and they haven't they

00:30:24.08 haven't worked with us yeah I mean it's weird that you wouldn't

00:30:28.10 see a tweet from cosmic crisp the apple company saying hey check out face

00:30:33.12 yeah what's more synonymous with apples than face

00:30:35.23 we are on our podcast I get you're making a joke there Gavin but we have

00:30:40.19 we have done more for the cosmic crisp than maybe

00:30:43.08 everybody outside of those who invented it

00:30:45.21 yeah it's fine but no one's ever going to talk to us because of our stupid name

00:30:49.12 that's

00:30:52.04 when you talk to people maybe I'm I'm sure I haven't when you talk to people

00:30:56.19 that don't know about the podcast and like that like you're trying to bring

00:30:59.21 them into the world how do you describe do you immediately feel the need to

00:31:03.17 describe what the the name references I don't think I've ever told anyone

00:31:07.12 about this book.

00:31:10.08 I don't think I have either every time as soon as I'm like the show

00:31:15.09 is called face and then I'll always add it's a reference to a baseball card

00:31:19.20 error like I immediately go into like you have to clarify it's a great name.

00:31:25.09 [Laughter]

00:31:27.09 I've even had to do like little like interview bits and stuff

00:31:30.07 with our marketing department about like

00:31:32.04 hey we need a sound bite or we need like a little two paragraph thing about what

00:31:35.09 face is about and stuff I don't even like doing that I'm just like it's just

00:31:38.08 a podcast about nothing I don't know I don't know I don't know how to explain

00:31:42.02 it yeah I don't wanna there's no way there's no way to do it without having

00:31:46.08 to start like unraveling a [ __ ] ball of string that never ends sure no yeah

00:31:49.22 so I just I prefer not to I just say uh you know what don't listen to it it's

00:31:53.01 not a big deal [Laughter]

00:31:55.03 yeah I would say it's like a deep law about nothing

00:32:01.07 deep lore about nothing nick said whenever my parents asked me at work I

00:32:05.14 refer to it as bleep face since they get weirded out when I say [ __ ] I go with

00:32:11.07 f-face is what I I bleep face is a good idea though deep lore about nothing I

00:32:15.09 like that that is good yeah that's poetic Kevin who wrote that for you was

00:32:20.02 that meg oh yeah she wrote that for me [Applause]

00:36:56.00 enrich the lore of this universe sorry well forget that that's obvious isn't it

00:37:00.12 it's obvious but do you remember like the first stories you used to tell

00:37:03.19 people like I'm not talking about like like here's what I did at school today

00:37:09.01 mom I'm talking about like a story that you thought was good enough

00:37:14.00 to remember and tell other people yeah do you

00:37:17.14 yeah I remembered three that I used like my three go-to stories oh yes well I

00:37:22.00 thought that I thought at the time I thought they were absolute bangers

00:37:27.18 and I must have been uh what age was I was riding around on bikes maybe like

00:37:32.15 seven or eight um one of my stories was that uh I watched my friend ride his

00:37:38.16 bike and he tried to spit at me but it blew back in his face I thought

00:37:43.07 that was an amazing story another one was that my friend got a

00:37:47.13 football stuck in his tree so he threw a broom up to try and get

00:37:52.12 the football down and the broom got stuck I thought that was an absolute me

00:37:57.07 slapper and my last story the last ghost two story was that it was once

00:38:02.12 it was what's so windy that it rang the doorbell which I still think is I still

00:38:08.17 think that's a battle of a story those are bad stories

00:38:11.20 I think those are good stories I retired the first two but I think it was cute

00:38:16.10 the wind rang the doorbell is still a good story

00:38:19.22 I think I've told two of those two of my stories on the podcast probably um one

00:38:24.19 is that I tried to set up that bit where you dump water on somebody's head when

00:38:28.12 they walk in a door by putting the bucket on top of the door you know

00:38:32.14 but I didn't tie it to anything so when my mom opened the door a full bucket of

00:38:35.19 water metal with [ __ I water in the head and I knocked her out

00:38:39.20 and uh there was that story I think I've told about how I I jumped that ramp on

00:38:45.18 my bike that everybody said I couldn't do and when I

00:38:49.09 landed both of my tires popped and there

00:38:51.07 was a bunch of smoke and I thought I had

00:38:54.02 died and I heard myself die and I had to wait for the smoke to settle to realize

00:38:57.18 I was still alive uh and the other one that's probably my oldest story that I

00:39:01.09 don't remember enough to tell it accurately is I remember playing there

00:39:05.23 was a hilarious sequence of events playing a game of uno in the first grade

00:39:10.18 with my friend Scott and I remember he said I don't have any reds in a really

00:39:15.16 funny way and I probably told that story until I was like 15. I wish I could

00:39:19.09 remember it now I thought that was wait and I'd be like

00:39:23.07 yeah and then Scott said I don't have any reds and I'm like laughing and

00:39:28.17 people were like what the [ __ ] okay but

00:39:32.02 you know when you're nine it's hilarious you were nine in the first grade

00:39:35.07 a lot of how old was I in the first place this is Alabama so I might have

00:39:39.02 been 16 I don't remember so those are the first stories that you

00:39:43.02 remember telling like the ones that you would cycle those are like like my

00:39:46.15 bangers that I'd bring around oh and the time

00:39:49.08 I I there was a I used to tell these other two stories one uh I loved telling

00:39:53.12 this story because I thought it made me sound like a badass uh I was digging my

00:39:57.12 friend had a pile of dirt in his backyard because they were doing some

00:40:01.09 landscaping and uh that same kid Scott and I were digging uh with shovels and I

00:40:04.22 got behind him and I wasn't paying attention and he swung the shuffle

00:40:08.04 behind him and hit me in the forehead and split my forehead open and I was

00:40:11.18 just gushing blood and I went to his mom and I said I need

00:40:14.08 to I need stitches I need a band-aid or something and she looked at me and she

00:40:17.14 said I have to take care of the baby you need to go home and I had to ride my

00:40:21.07 bike home covered in blood and my I was a latchkey kid so my mom was at work so

00:40:24.15 I just sat in the bathroom crying with like towels on my head well I just

00:40:28.17 [ __ ] bled like an inch over my eyeball and then another time uh

00:40:34.00 the other friend we had a kid named Casey we were we were [ __ ]

00:40:39.12 we were at a construction site and there was a little fire there that somebody

00:40:43.21 had built like at night the kids or something and it was still going so we

00:40:46.23 put a ramp and we were jumping over it on our bikes and he hit it wrong and

00:40:50.11 fell and I thought he was going to fall into the fire but he didn't instead he

00:40:55.20 fell and impaled his neck on rebar Jesus Christ

00:40:58.14 yeah I'm not kidding dude what yeah through like the side of his neck and

00:41:02.11 came out the other end and he goes oh what I swear to god I swear to god and

00:41:07.04 he he stood up he like popped it off and there was like blood and I just ran him

00:41:11.08 home I didn't hurt him I mean it went one it like was like the tail like on

00:41:15.17 the far right of his neck like if you pull your neck out it just like pierced

00:41:19.18 it right there and it bled but it didn't hurt it didn't

00:41:23.01 it didn't hit anything important it was just stitches and a terrified trip to

00:41:27.06 the emergency room and I don't think he was allowed to hang out with me after

00:41:32.13 that I think I for some reason he's like Shaun of the dead at his own neck

00:41:36.17 yeah this would have been 1983 probably 1982 yeah it was [ __ ] gross and scary

00:41:41.12 yeah how's it going it's horrendous man that's wave that's a way better

00:41:46.04 story than the broom no I don't know the broom's pretty good because how did he

00:41:51.15 get the broom barely enough credit for getting Casey home that day I got in a

00:41:55.22 lot of trouble and I [ __ ] saved that kid but whatever

00:41:59.19 what about you Audrey I know I put you on the

00:42:03.18 well no I got I'll think about this more there are two that immediately come to

00:42:08.05 mind I remember being like I don't know maybe five years old that's

00:42:12.14 at my grandparents house and my my grandpa was talking to her neighbor gian

00:42:17.07 and I decided that like oh I want to get in on this conversation I'm going to

00:42:22.06 need to have a real banger of a story to like cut in and wild the room and so it

00:42:26.13 was like there's like a cop show on tv and I walked out and I was like I'll

00:42:30.15 just make up like some story I'll be like I walked out and I said something

00:42:34.03 like did you just see that on the news there's this guy who like solved crimes

00:42:37.16 and he dodged like eight bullets and then like five-year-old brad I was like

00:42:41.05 this is the coolest story ever and they immediately said oh that must have like

00:42:45.03 that that was a show or you that that was that's not real that's not what you

00:42:49.01 just said didn't actually happen and I I just walked away dejected they did oh

00:42:53.05 they just shut you down they shut me down immediately and it didn't it was

00:42:57.09 fair to the other story it's not so much the story this is just embarrassing

00:43:01.17 I remember getting Xbox live when I was like 10

00:43:05.03 and uh as a 10 year old playing Xbox live this

00:43:08.03 was the time where people actually talked on Xbox live they were party

00:43:12.10 chats so you'd go into lobbies and I had like my go-to move at that

00:43:17.09 time because it's like 2004

00:43:19.09 and I'm a 10 year old I would like essentially every conversation would be

00:43:22.17 like so you watch family guy that was like my cut in to it and I had it was

00:43:28.00 set up in the living room and I joined like a lobby once

00:43:30.19 and uh as soon as I joined I was like hey and my mom from the kitchen went so

00:43:35.00 you guys watch family guy making fun of me and I've ever since that moment have

00:43:40.01 a hyper awareness if I'm in a room with anybody else that I'm talking I was it

00:43:44.10 might be the most embarrassed I've ever been in my life

00:43:47.03 and to this day I struggle with talking with somebody else in the room like if

00:43:51.02 it's a phone call it doesn't matter what it is because of family guy and that's

00:43:55.04 just burning into my brain so she just knew you that you were gonna say it oh

00:44:00.21 she knew because I said it [ __ ] 97

00:44:03.07 times a day every time I joined a halo lobby so she just immediately said it

00:44:06.22 and it just was def cause I knew how lame it was even at that time but to get

00:44:11.18 called out on it is that why we can't do this podcast in

00:44:15.00 person because you're still with us yes that's the only reason

00:44:19.14 I'm starting to realize why you are the way that you are really was that

00:44:25.04 what what did you uncover from that you got from there to the pencil [Laughter]

00:44:32.10 I don't know just people just like shooting down your confidence and then

00:44:36.20 you're just like over thinking stuff to the point where yeah you're just an

00:44:40.14 insane person well I okay that's total sense

00:44:43.18 it's funny that you say that because I had one of those recently I recorded a

00:44:48.23 second episode of the q a thing that I'm doing and one of the questions was

00:44:53.18 what is your favorite holiday treat and I open with is eggnog a tree like I went

00:44:57.12 in on eggnog specifically a thing I've never had

00:45:01.01 and Eric called me out for it and he's like you are a psychopath the question

00:45:04.20 is what is your face why are you talking about a thing you've never had the

00:45:08.11 reason why I did that is because that was the third version of that recording

00:45:12.16 I had done and I didn't want to answer it in the exact same way that I answered

00:45:16.21 the previous recording I didn't like how they came out the other two so that was

00:45:20.09 the third time I had answered that question and I felt like even though

00:45:24.23 nobody would hear the other two in my head it was lame to use the same

00:45:28.12 answer over and over again so I was like how do I switch this up a little bit

00:45:33.11 I'll make a little comment about eggnog and it just seems insane

00:45:37.12 I like the idea of like a celebrity doing interviews but they

00:45:41.06 never want to answer the same way like on all the talk shows they just start

00:45:44.22 telling lies and making up [ __ ] it's not

00:45:47.02 telling lies I was just like how can I get it how no but I I was saying I'm

00:45:51.10 like I never said I did I said is it is it considered a holiday treat because

00:45:55.20 why would you give that answer though because the thing that I was bringing up

00:46:00.21 to you is the question was what's your favorite holiday treat and you said is

00:46:04.19 eggnog a holiday treat I've never had it yeah because it wasn't what's your

00:46:09.12 favorite holiday you've never had no you [ __ ] you guys are missing the thing

00:46:13.14 entirely I'd answered that two times already and I just answered clearly like

00:46:17.21 these are what I view as this was my third time I didn't want to duplicate

00:46:21.11 that so in the moment I'm like how can I spice this answer up a bit I'll do a

00:46:25.12 thing about eggnog I'll talk about eggnog for like 10 seconds and then I'll

00:46:30.13 get into the exact same thing just heard

00:46:33.09 it I know that that's how my brain works I'm saying this so gavin's right I'm

00:46:37.03 over thinking this thing that nobody's going to hear but I'm like I can't say

00:46:40.08 the way you've been you've been left with this weird level

00:46:43.18 of confidence where you over think everything and then you over

00:46:47.14 correct and just go blasting in with all this crazy confidence in other

00:46:52.04 directions you're nothing works about you that's that's maybe the meanest thing

00:46:58.10 anyone's ever said to me I don't think it's me I don't think it's better

00:47:03.09 I think nothing I think lots works on you it just works

00:47:08.21 weirdly yeah it just nothing works as you'd expect and what it produces is

00:47:14.10 actually a very nice and very funny person but that's it

00:47:18.21 it's all well built on what nice unless your name is Kevin Donovan

00:47:24.10 well no I was nice to Kevin Donovan all my interactions with him directly I

00:47:29.23 would argue that reaching out to him at all is not nice

00:47:34.00 really I don't view it that way knowing what was coming I just I liked

00:47:38.01 that like that man could have lived in blissful ignorance for the rest of his

00:47:42.12 life not bothering to know that the three of us hated his [ __ ] movie

00:47:47.03 but you chose to initiate contact you chose first contact

00:47:50.17 nah I I don't know I don't see I don't I

00:47:53.08 don't I disagree I respectfully disagree I think there's a world in which we

00:47:56.16 become great friends with Kevin Donovan and none of that would have been

00:48:00.02 possible with well I hope so it'll be a hell of a recovery imagine if Kevin

00:48:03.14 Donovan directs the child kicker movie you ever make that into a thing

00:48:08.03 best case scenario Kevin dot ton becomes a full-time member of this podcast I

00:48:12.15 would like he's the piece we're missing can we

00:48:14.14 I don't know maybe like do uh I don't know get Kevin Donovan involved in some

00:48:18.16 way I'd love I'd love to have Kevin if he gets involved I'm buying him like a

00:48:23.05 hamper or something like we got to make some sort of nice chest

00:48:27.16 I agree I'd love to get a fruit basket of some maybe like some nice jams I

00:48:31.04 don't know yeah cosmic creation of gems maybe I don't know we'll figure that out

00:48:35.05 we could say that we could send him an apple basket that you weave

00:48:40.04 I don't know if that will meant without context there's no context a man just

00:48:46.07 receives a poorly woven basket with full of a specific apple and he just goes

00:48:51.16 what did I do what if like Canadians sent me a crushed tumbleweed in the mail

00:49:00.00 um so I had I had Kevin Donovan and I had one other thing

00:49:04.08 uh that I wanted to to talk about that is a very funny

00:49:08.00 funny discovery I have a new I have a new nickname

00:49:11.07 a new nickname oh that is uh exciting um somebody emailed in

00:49:18.17 somebody emailed this to me they were they were looking through like just news

00:49:23.20 archive stuff you know like they're just searching different like news clippings

00:49:28.22 whatever and they found they found a news clipping on me when I'm like seven

00:49:33.17 playing tennis you were in the news I was in the new I

00:49:37.01 remember this happening too I used to do like tennis lessons at this place but I

00:49:40.15 was in the news they like filmed it probably is like trying to do

00:49:43.07 advertising for their tennis program that they're doing like the fastest

00:49:46.23 sewing machine [Music]

00:49:49.15 it is a continuation this is the entry point of me eventually learning the

00:49:54.23 sewing machine let me introduce you to Andrew sweet swing panton oh my

00:50:00.17 god you're adorable I was expecting some like

00:50:04.23 like distant photo of like a bunch of they'll you know like they're treating

00:50:09.09 you like you're freaking roger federer look at that look at the picture the

00:50:13.04 wording on it is really funny if Andrew pant keeps his eye on the ball in

00:50:17.02 preparations for his return during the numbers he does not like your eyes are

00:50:20.22 nowhere near that ball dude they're looking you are spiking the lens the

00:50:24.21 phrasing of the return is like I am like this tennis prodigy that got hurt and

00:50:29.06 I'm not going back out of retirement yeah so I feel so bad I'll credit next

00:50:34.08 time next episode I'll give proper credit to the person who found this so

00:50:38.02 the person found it and they they're like this is look at this

00:50:41.17 ridiculous thing I found they then took it even further and they made

00:50:46.05 Andrew panton sweet swing rookie cards there are there's this is in existence

00:50:51.14 they went to the top's website they made a collection oh

00:50:55.11 we need to sell those in our card thing someday that's brilliant the fact that

00:51:00.15 it's taken from a black and white newspaper clearly may I you could look

00:51:04.15 at that and have no idea what year that was oh ah it's probably could easily be

00:51:08.22 from the 40s I guess the tennis racquet style gives it away it looks like night

00:51:13.07 it looks like 1975 to me it's a 19 I'd say 99 would be my guess what what brand

00:51:18.15 uh racket are you rocking there oh that's a good uh head maybe is that is that

00:51:23.18 yeah I think it does I was always a slazenja kind of guy I've never heard of

00:51:29.01 schlazinger oh it is head look at me I [ __ ]

00:51:32.16 called the logo I swing a I swing a babalot myself

00:51:36.15 a lot like fan of this oh do I dab a lot I can't play uh I can't play tennis

00:51:41.01 anymore right now so but well when I get back to it dude you're a cute kid

00:51:46.13 why uh you know why I can't play uh the light

00:51:49.03 arthritis and injuries um I thought it was because you're training to throw a

00:51:53.12 faster ball I can't even get to the training

00:51:56.08 yet right now because of all the other issues but that's okay I don't want to

00:51:59.20 talk about me and my broken old ass body Geoff do you remember when you committed

00:52:04.00 to hitting a thousand baseball dude the baseballs the baseballs are in

00:52:07.16 I got to do that what do you mean they're in

00:52:09.22 Mallory told me the baseballs are here but you can't do that there's no way

00:52:13.16 that you can you can if you're not in a state in which you can't play tennis you

00:52:18.19 can't hit a thousand balls well I I can't play tennis for fun

00:52:23.05 but I can hit a thousand balls and do more damage to myself for you know my job

00:52:28.19 I'll do that that's sad I know there's no way I

00:52:35.20 I think you might die if you hit more than I'm going to say 115.

00:52:41.09 I'd look at that we need to I'll get uh Eric can you get that set up thanks bud

00:52:47.09 appreciate it oh god we're uh we're almost an hour in

00:52:51.05 already off that photo of patton so much

00:52:54.03 that is such a great photo why what it's

00:52:57.01 just like really it's like a really good picture

00:52:59.10 can we put on a shirt I don't I've never

00:53:01.20 looked that cool in a still image in all my life I don't think I look cool in

00:53:06.00 that photo at all you do I guess like I like how many

00:53:09.16 how many kids have like a properly professional action shot taken of them

00:53:14.13 that is you know what I will say that that photo has more of an action shot

00:53:19.12 than 90 of the baseball cards we open it's true

00:53:22.10 balls in frame it is a good photo between that and your men in black

00:53:26.10 photos dude oh my god I can't wait to see what else you've got

00:53:30.07 you're holding on to I don't I think those might be the greatest hits I fell

00:53:34.06 out I remember the men in black getting that for Halloween and like

00:53:37.18 renting the suits and like having to lie that I was going to a wedding

00:53:41.16 for it that's like my main memory is that are we going to post to the

00:53:45.08 store tuxedo I hope so what are we going to do I was trying to think there's

00:53:49.07 another photo I want I want to I want to make posters

00:53:52.21 and sell them I want to get I want that it's genuinely the last time I wore a

00:53:56.19 tuxedo and I think there's only one other time and there's a photo of it

00:53:59.20 somewhere that I'll try to find it's a terrible photo it's great I think I've

00:54:04.08 only worn it twice tuxedo well does anybody have anything else

00:54:09.00 they want to cover before we end uh not anything that uh

00:54:13.01 I would I would say is like expansive I have one

00:54:17.01 little little thing if Gavin or yeah um and this is more of a directive to the

00:54:22.23 audience so uh I I tried to mention this a couple episodes ago but we I got

00:54:26.19 distracted but I have uh I've been thinking a lot about um well first off

00:54:31.17 let me say I've been hanging out a lot in uh laundromats and I'm really into it

00:54:36.10 I'm really digging laundromats these days why uh well they're like

00:54:41.09 they're they smell good first of all and they're warm on a cold day not that we

00:54:45.08 have a lot of those and uh they're empty and there's like a there's like a

00:54:49.12 rhythmic uh thumping and sound of all the machines going on at once it's it's

00:54:53.21 quite uh but you're not doing laundry record it uh and I'm doing laundry are

00:54:58.05 you uh you are doing laundry yeah no I don't hang out at laundromats just to

00:55:01.23 hang out yet but I could get there but you made it sound like you were because

00:55:05.16 I assume you I assume you have a washing machine I do

00:55:09.08 I do but you know Henry the bulldog uh you know he has he has problems with his

00:55:13.17 pee pee and sometimes at night and so he wears a diaper uh and then sometimes it

00:55:17.09 doesn't get it or sometimes he wiggles out and sometimes the you know the

00:55:22.08 sheets the duvet and everything get get a little Henry on them and it's hard to

00:55:27.07 wash king-sized duvets and dry them in my washer and dryer so we've started

00:55:32.07 going to the laundromat where you can knock it out in no time at all like in

00:55:36.00 those industrial dryers and uh and industrial washers and I just quite

00:55:40.15 enjoy the laundromat so I've been thinking

00:55:43.02 uh maybe into my post rooster teeth post podcasting career when it's time to to

00:55:47.15 settle down and retire I don't think I'll ever want to stop working but what

00:55:51.08 I do think I want to do is open up a laundromat I think that might be my

00:55:54.20 second act is being a laundromat so I wanted to talk to that I want to

00:55:58.15 talk to the audience if anybody out there owns a laundromat has experience

00:56:02.03 running or managing a laundromat what was it like did you enjoy it is it as

00:56:05.05 much fun as I think it would be is it profitable I'd love to know just uh

00:56:09.03 email Andrew and then he can filter all that to me uh and uh yeah I just I would

00:56:13.21 love to hear your laundromat feedback or your personal experiences with uh

00:56:18.03 laundromats because I'm really [ __ ]

00:56:20.04 jazzed about them right now it's where that was like the one appliance that

00:56:24.13 could be put in a different building and run as a business like you don't you

00:56:28.09 don't get a business that's just like 18 fridges and you could just keep stuff

00:56:33.18 cold freeze on that cool on that yeah like if you can't if you have room

00:56:39.06 for your own fridge just keep your [ __ ]

00:56:41.07 in a refrigerator yeah or like oh do you do you need to you need

00:56:45.12 some extra space for your casserole come on over to oven Matt

00:56:51.09 you call ahead we'll preheat it to whatever you 425 it'll be waiting for you

00:56:57.12 you just text the preheat up to the oven anyway I would love to if you've ever

00:57:04.00 worked in a laundromat or or owned one please let let Andrew know and he can

00:57:09.03 let me know I don't think I've ever been inside one

00:57:11.21 I want to check maybe I'll wash some uh yeah maybe a big come on to the

00:57:16.04 laundromat with me someday hang out with me the laundromat

00:57:20.04 and uh we'll spend some money I like that I started off as a

00:57:23.04 a fan of rooster teeth and I end up later in life doing laundry with one of

00:57:27.09 the guys that started it in a laundromat

00:57:29.16 we're just hanging out doing our laundry that's great I'd love to do that yeah

00:57:33.12 I'm looking you know I I don't think I ever want to stop completely but at some

00:57:38.15 point I don't know that I want the high stress high pressure uh uh

00:57:42.21 career that I've had uh constantly reinventing yourself and trying to be

00:57:47.13 funny and create new products and I'll all share all of these foibles of

00:57:52.13 you know at some point I'm gonna be tired of that and uh man yeah

00:57:55.16 laundromats smell good and they're the perfect temperature and they're they're

00:57:59.17 they're they have a nice hum it's and they're empty

00:58:02.19 people come in they throw their clothes in and they leave that's also something

00:58:06.10 I like about laundromats or at least the laundromat I've been going to is it

00:58:10.17 there seems to be uh it seems to be populated and propagated by decent human

00:58:15.02 beings that understand that they're all in the same boat you know like I

00:58:18.11 remember when I worked in a I lived in an apartment complex I would do laundry

00:58:21.22 and sometimes I'd come back and I'd be like somebody stole my [ __ ] pants

00:58:24.22 somebody else out there is a 3229 or whatever and stole my [ __ ] blue jeans

00:58:28.16 that doesn't seem to happen at a laundromat people seem to be respectful

00:58:32.03 of each other's stuff and I appreciate that too it's like it's like a place

00:58:35.16 where decorum still exists in the world it does seem like it's interesting

00:58:41.07 there's a very unique person oh I don't know like personality isn't the

00:58:44.08 right word I feel like if you discover once you discover the laundromat you

00:58:48.17 don't go back unless you are in a situation which like if it makes sense

00:58:53.09 to use laundromat for your lifestyle or whatever um

00:58:56.02 it would be extremely useful I wonder what the maintenance is like like how

00:58:59.09 often you have to clean them and I mean potentially you've got like 40

00:59:03.11 plumbing problems about to happen I was trying to get in get behind and kind of

00:59:07.08 look at the machinations of it and stuff

00:59:09.10 and I I I get a sense that because these

00:59:11.14 machines look old as dirt but they still seem to be running fine I think they're

00:59:15.11 built to last I'm sure that there's maintenance I'm sure uh

00:59:19.18 there are problems you have to deal with I imagine it would be quite scary it

00:59:24.04 would have been quite a scary place to own in the freeze last year but uh

00:59:28.23 all the time yeah I get the impression that I mean it

00:59:32.06 basically runs itself you know that they're there you just provide

00:59:35.09 electricity there's a thing you can go buy soap and [ __ ] if you need to it's

00:59:38.21 all coin operated all you have to do is have a change machine in there and then

00:59:42.04 like I've been in that laundromat probably four or five times over the

00:59:45.11 last few since thanksgiving and I've never seen anybody working there yeah

00:59:49.18 that's about to say I feel like it would be great for money laundering you don't

00:59:53.22 really need a staff it's like a business in the name

00:59:58.20 yeah a little on the nose then at that point isn't it it would be like

01:00:03.07 obnoxious to make a laundromat your money laundering operation

01:00:07.05 you should see if you could call it money oh Eric said the same thing to

01:00:11.18 call it money laundromat and see if it raises [Music]

01:00:18.06 well I wasn't sure what what today's podcast

01:00:51.05 realized that you kind of picked mid-sentences

01:00:54.11 yeah no I pivoted mid-sentence and then I realized that's why I called it out

01:00:58.02 okay uh yeah dumb move on my part uh but that's the end of this one

01:01:02.18 so uh if you uh I don't know just [ __ ]

01:01:33.19 situation has evolved oh my god what are you doing

01:01:37.12 I'm just reading what it says right but we don't have to it's not for the

01:01:41.22 episode this is for us it is now common with 600 units

01:01:46.08 we don't have to do what he's laying out

01:01:49.12 this is his idea for the way he's laying it out with like these colors I like it

01:01:53.16 I like the color you're saying we can't do white because white is too expensive

01:01:57.17 they don't and it you can only get it oh one you know you know those

01:02:01.02 manufacturers those like when you throw a bouncy ball and it like lights up the

01:02:05.03 different colors like that mechanism like apparently like my uncle invented

01:02:09.06 I've I'm somehow related to the person that invented that in some way

01:02:13.10 what they're not I don't think they're my uncle but they're definitely in the

01:02:17.14 family tree somewhere well this is what second cousin

01:02:21.19 end this end this what is happening we got a cliffhanger now hey audience would

01:02:27.18 you oh I see pink yellow green and orange what is

01:02:31.13 your favorite color I love orange I like I like orange too but I have the

01:02:35.12 association with orange always makes me feel like I'm picking it because of that

01:02:39.20 uh I like green's not bad ah there's no wrong color when it comes to a [ __ ]

01:02:44.23 stick no thanks for listening I should wait until we can get white

01:02:48.05 I decide they're expensive yeah and I I like I like the orange one

01:02:53.03 what do you have against orange ah nothing it sounds like something

01:02:56.12 just wait to see a color come through the logo I think that's what's weirding
