00:00:36.11 Hello and welcome to another episode of the

00:00:40.23 F**kFuckFacePodcast uh starring Geoff Ramsey Gavin free and Andrew pen ton in no

00:00:46.03 particular order uh in the comedy triangle uh I was gonna say uh

00:00:50.17 start us off there's if there's one thing two things that I've noticed that

00:00:55.07 the audience has polarized about uh and by polarized I mean that a percentage of

00:00:59.23 them [ __ ] hate when we do it it's a lot of people don't like when we talk

00:01:03.05 about sports too much and a lot of people don't like when we talk about

00:01:06.13 survivor too much so before we go into survivor talk maybe we should keep it

00:01:10.06 brief yeah no I agree with that did you see there was a I thought you were going

00:01:13.21 to say before we go into survivor tour let's get into some sports

00:01:17.22 I have both things on my notes talking about both things there's been a

00:01:22.22 substantial update also can't be brief I enjoy that there was a subreddit thread

00:01:27.17 about I was really it was the most conflicted it was like I really like

00:01:32.02 when they talk about sports they should talk about sports more and then all the

00:01:36.03 comments were as people debating whether they like the sports talk or not so

00:01:40.04 somebody who really liked it people uploading it for either visibility or

00:01:44.08 they agreed with it and then all the comments of people being uh either not

00:01:49.18 enjoying it or debating the value of it I I will say when it

00:01:53.15 comes to sports stuff I find that we are mostly only drawn to silly fun oh

00:01:59.03 absolutely I'm never just going to talk about the box score of a game and how

00:02:02.23 some season is going it's uh the weird angles of it like you said the

00:02:07.00 things that make me laugh are the things I enjoy so speaking of the the silly

00:02:11.22 angles of it uh if we're gonna talk about survivor Gavin

00:02:14.18 maybe we should talk about the events leading up to survivor and then the

00:02:19.18 hiccups well that's more interesting than survivor because survive talking

00:02:23.03 about actual survivor is boring boring anyone who's not seen it yeah but you

00:02:27.23 you offered to have a little survivor watch party at your house yeah and so

00:02:32.07 you and meg were like dude absolutely we'll come over and I was excited uh

00:02:37.07 very very excited I don't think we've had anybody over to the house in in

00:02:42.23 months and uh uh so we set to survivors at seven you guys

00:02:46.15 were gonna pick up some pizza on the way over uh and

00:02:50.10 I uh at four o'clock I left my house to go run some errands and I walked back in

00:02:54.19 my house at five o'clock and something felt different you know

00:02:58.05 like when you walk into a room and something's changed but you don't know

00:03:01.14 what it is immediately it took me from the front of my house until my bedroom

00:03:06.21 like in the matrix that I until I realized oh the power's out the thing that's

00:03:11.18 different is it's a little dark and I can't hear the the air

00:03:15.03 conditioning humming and I go what the [ __ ]

00:03:18.13 and I and then Emily walks into him she goes powers out and I go oh

00:03:23.03 what and so I I go to my phone to look up like the city of Austin outage map

00:03:28.15 and I have a text from the city of Austin that says hey uh your power's out

00:03:34.08 just fyi don't worry we have a crew dispatch to fix it the estimated repair

00:03:40.02 time is 703 pm survivor comes on at 700 pm

00:03:44.00 so I text Gavin and meg and I'm like I I can't believe that this is a thing but

00:03:49.07 I uh of all like I know we just made plans two hours ago to hang out but uh

00:03:54.17 somehow in the last two hours my power went out and I and by the way the only

00:04:00.06 only place in Austin that the power's out I made a video of it

00:04:03.07 yeah that's what I was gonna say usually when you look at the outage map it's

00:04:07.14 like number of customers affected seven thousand because usually like a big

00:04:12.17 chunk of the grid has got out it was like number of customers affected 16.

00:04:18.03 I took the video I mean obviously I can't show the video because it shows

00:04:22.10 some identifying information but I made a little video of them where it zooms

00:04:26.01 out and you can see all of Austin has you continue and continue to zoom in

00:04:31.03 till you get to my like my little neighborhood uh so then

00:04:34.19 gav was like well I guess we'll [ __ ]

00:04:38.06 come over to our house and meg is like yeah uh I'll you guys pick up the pizza

00:04:41.21 now and so I'm like oh [ __ ] that's okay

00:04:44.16 yeah I feel bad but yeah okay so as I'm te and she was like I tell you what

00:04:49.03 we'll check in in like 30 minutes and and we'll see if your power's still out

00:04:52.13 and she texts me at like six and and is like hey we're supposed to pick up the

00:04:56.08 pizza in like 15 minutes or something uh should we switch it over to your name

00:05:02.06 and I'm typing yeah I looked outside there's no there's no repair crew in

00:05:06.04 sight there's no way in hell the power's coming back on and as I was typing that

00:05:11.05 the power kicked on all the lights turned on and I just deleted that and

00:05:15.04 said we're good come on over [Laughter]

00:05:17.22 and then we're we're we make it all the way through

00:05:21.11 survivor and we get to the [ __ ]

00:05:23.18 tribal council oh no and we're watching live on hulu live

00:05:29.01 right that's what I have and uh it just turns off it just goes

00:05:33.03 yeah we can't play this right now yeah power was still on but hulu was just

00:05:37.01 like yeah we're having problems yeah huli was like nah we're good oh weird

00:05:41.01 and I was like what and I go to grab the controller and it clicks back on

00:05:45.11 and we're fine oh and then it does it again

00:05:48.10 and then we're fine and then it does it again and then we're fine and then it

00:05:51.14 does it for a while and Gavin and meg are looking at me like I [ __ ] hate

00:05:56.13 you we could have been watching this at home in our jammies comfy in our house

00:06:00.23 with our 200 cats instead we drive all the way across town to your [ __ ]

00:06:05.18 ghetto and uh and now we're infected with all of your house problems worse

00:06:09.11 your power doesn't work now your goddamn

00:06:11.11 tv won't play your goddamn show and then

00:06:13.12 I'm like uh so I switch over to the hulu on the Xbox and then uh and that didn't

00:06:17.13 work either so then I'm like uh and as I'm like about to throw in the towel and

00:06:21.06 [ __ ] just like crawl into a hole it kicked back on it had recorded it we

00:06:25.12 were able to finish watching it there's we missed like 90 of that tribal though

00:06:29.16 yeah well we missed a lot of tribal council luckily there were two in the

00:06:34.13 episode yeah we missed the second one most of it I also like that I watch

00:06:40.04 I mean 99 of stuff I watch is on-demand vod never live the last thing I watched

00:06:46.00 live using live television was the uh euro finals and the time

00:06:50.23 I think yeah I remember it too weird the time before that I think I was

00:06:55.10 watching the 2018 world cup final or something on live tv so I watched live

00:07:00.13 tv maybe once or twice a year and this time it was just failing

00:07:05.22 miserably what a turd but we got we got through it

00:07:09.00 like well how hard is it to have a are you not blown away that it can't

00:07:12.16 it's survivor like everyone's watching it is that why it goes down I don't know

00:07:18.00 man have you ever had issues with hulu live going into this no not like that no

00:07:22.23 great very very very rarely yeah I don't think so

00:07:26.02 have you ever had a watch party with hulu live no there we go I don't think I

00:07:30.01 yeah this is not my other thing it's the

00:07:33.09 weather equivalent of your experience as soon as you Gavin

00:07:36.02 organize the thing oh my god it can't rain in the house but it can just

00:07:41.11 disconnect that's what happens yeah when we make an indoor plan the

00:07:44.19 power and the internet goes on the plans were it was you know I just realized we

00:07:49.02 could we could go back a couple steps the the whole story is even a little bit

00:07:53.08 funnier because like a month ago Emily made a reservation for dinner for four

00:07:58.00 and then she was like we'll just invite Gavin and meg or if they're not

00:08:01.14 available somebody else closer to the event and see if anybody

00:08:04.02 wants to go to dinner with us and I was like that's a great idea and so about a

00:08:05.18 week ago I texted gav and I was like hey

00:08:08.04 do y'all want to go get dinner Wednesday night

00:08:10.18 and gavin's like absolutely so we all get ready to do it and then yes the two

00:08:15.06 days ago Gavin texts me and goes you realize we're going to dinner during the

00:08:19.05 survivor uh airing and I was like ah Christ really

00:08:24.13 and then so and then it was like late at night and I Emily wasn't home from work

00:08:28.08 yet and I was like well I don't know dude I get I don't know what we're doing

00:08:31.18 so I had to wait for Emily to get home and we talk it out and then so

00:08:34.23 then we canceled the dinner plans yesterday morning so and then pivoted to

00:08:39.22 survivor plans all so that the power could go out perfect was it a place that

00:08:44.00 you had to wait on a reservation for could you just rebook how big of a no we

00:08:48.04 could rebook it it wasn't that wasn't a big it wasn't a huge deal okay no it

00:08:51.13 wasn't a huge deal at all so uh same time next week yeah your house this time

00:08:56.07 all right we'll see how it goes tomorrow we're gonna go tradesies yeah

00:09:00.10 this is great it's like a second layer to the game for

00:09:03.01 me just hearing how it failed for the two of you so you had an internet was it

00:09:07.06 wasn't even internet outage it was an app adage and yeah the power went out I

00:09:12.10 think we should be very afraid yeah what will happen when we order [Laughter]

00:09:17.09 [Music]

00:09:19.01 I will just have both my ankles roll but that's every day

00:09:23.08 I'll show up in a full body cast have you ever had a double ankle roll I've

00:09:27.06 never had a double ankle roll no it doesn't mean it doesn't need to happen

00:09:30.13 at the same time but like staggered it so that the other one still sore and

00:09:33.22 then you rolled the neck yeah yeah like James con and misery I absolutely have

00:09:38.02 I've had things where I've hurt one ankle and then had the hobble on the

00:09:42.02 other ankle and then hurt the other one so by the time the first one healed the

00:09:46.20 second one was still in pain yeah I've I've done the flip I've ankle flip I

00:09:51.15 I dated a girl briefly in the army who like three days after we started dating

00:09:57.11 she slipped and broke her leg and had to be in a full leg cast and wear crutches

00:10:02.21 and then she was in her room getting ready and [ __ ] fell off the crutches

00:10:07.00 and broke her arm and had to have a full arm cast so she had a full arm cast on

00:10:12.23 one side of her body and a full leg cast on the other and then she dumped me

00:10:18.06 so were you were you unsupportive as far as I know she's still in those casts uh

00:10:23.13 no I was like it was really nice but I think she I guess she had other stuff on

00:10:27.03 her mind I'd also like to point out your phrasing

00:10:30.04 you said she was wearing crutches like they're clothing

00:10:34.12 using them whatever did I say wearing like you pop on a pair of gloves

00:10:38.22 I uh I've been losing it with that stuff

00:10:40.20 lately the other day somebody honked and we were in the car and I screamed I

00:10:45.01 yelled don't bark at me and Emily was like what the [ __ ] did you just say and

00:10:49.18 I was like don't honk at me and she was like no you

00:10:52.03 did not and I was like oh man and uh yeah I don't know why I did that but I'm

00:10:56.17 maybe early dementia maybe you did it in a face recently you said you were like

00:11:02.00 halfway through saying something and then Andrew said a word and then you

00:11:05.01 ended your sentence with that word and no one noticed I wish I had uh I'll pull

00:11:08.23 up the clip for next time because it made me laugh I was like did you mean to

00:11:12.10 say that okay it's from like two episodes ago I didn't

00:11:16.12 notice that either I'd love to hear it hey so uh what is new with you guys by

00:11:20.07 the way uh can we talk speaking of things that nobody wants to hear quickly

00:11:24.07 quickly cover the fact that there is magic in the air we got some magic going

00:11:28.06 I'm feeling good about it I don't think Gavin necessarily even knows about this

00:11:32.05 oh it's stylish uh the magic has begun br wow I almost called you a different

00:11:36.00 [ __ ] name I'm sorry I thought you were gonna could be brick I was yeah I

00:11:39.03 was gonna call you well you got a million [ __ ] nicknames so it's not

00:11:42.10 out of the question that I could just throw a wrong name out there and you

00:11:45.18 were once called that child brick gav nav brick it's a great deal

00:11:53.20 do you know somebody named brick I don't know anyone named brick that's the the

00:11:59.09 borderlands guy is brick right the the one the big guy the like the the

00:12:05.00 class sure he's brick Steve carell who is he in uh anchorman

00:12:09.22 yeah he's brick tanning I in the same way the Chevy Chevy chase thing I [ __ ]

00:12:15.20 up Steve carrell's name for years four years were you calling him Steve

00:12:19.14 car roll yeah sure was years Steve car roll every time I'd say

00:12:23.12 Steve nobody correct but you got the Steve part right I got the Steve right

00:12:27.06 yeah I've never called him brick car roll which would be a fantastic combination

00:12:33.07 Steve carell yes but the magic Andy Dalton ankle injury knee Bruce something

00:12:39.09 happened he heard us like he's out Justin fields is in Justin fields is

00:12:44.00 starting it's a big yes big news I needed that I I would say

00:12:49.11 that in the three-way race for rookie of the year

00:12:52.21 I am in last place right now naji Harris

00:12:56.11 is doing okay but Gavin your quarterback mac Jones is doing very well and Andrew

00:13:01.06 it looks like Justin fields it has uh green pastures ahead of him so um I'm a

00:13:05.12 little nervous magic is on the field now he wasn't there he's coming in weird

00:13:09.07 plays every now and then but now he is starting he has an opportunity to win

00:13:13.14 the job this is either like the magic will carry forward this is a lock to win

00:13:18.11 or he will lose the job and the bet will

00:13:20.08 be over by the mid-season I'll come dead

00:13:22.11 last but I believe in magic well so I've been taking the the idea that I'm gonna

00:13:26.16 let naji do do the first couple weeks on his own see what he's capable of before

00:13:31.12 I intervene you know what I mean yeah so I'm just kind of I'm kind of playing it

00:13:35.06 fast and loose right now but I I don't want you to think it's it's because I'm

00:13:38.13 not paying attention I am I'm just waiting for the right moment to strike

00:13:42.23 oh fair enough I would also I'd just recommend to anybody to to get some

00:13:46.12 magic in your life generally speaking we can't have too much magic though on the

00:13:50.10 same subjects sure oh no what do you mean because then it will be like that

00:13:54.04 Quidditch match everyone's fighting over the same broom no

00:13:57.03 no you just you load up on are you saying like from the same source I don't

00:14:00.06 really understand your point there's no such thing as a cap of too much magic or

00:14:04.00 is it like too powerful well if it's no like too much magic on the same

00:14:09.09 subject why would that be an issue do we lose Gavin [Applause]

00:14:13.20 did we lose Gavin or did he just not reply

00:14:16.02 did you not hit me no I heard you say too much magic on the same yeah it went

00:14:20.19 quiet for a moment subject yeah but I don't know we interpolated that yeah

00:14:24.23 yeah well regardless of that I would just recommend people I don't know what

00:14:28.05 you're trying to say and it's coming in and out we're gonna move past it you're

00:14:32.21 wrong whatever you're saying is wrong this is incorrect

00:14:36.12 but I would recommend having magic in your life having some protection potions

00:14:42.15 on whatever you need because I had I had a really shitty week and I was like oh

00:14:46.15 man I guess this whole magic thing isn't working out this is a previous week and

00:14:51.09 then I realized it was probably heightened by the fact I

00:14:54.20 had the magic I wouldn't have wanted to go through that week without the magic I

00:14:59.03 probably would have been gorged by a bull or something as soon as I left the

00:15:02.18 house yeah if it wasn't for the magic as

00:15:06.06 long as you have magic no matter how bad things are you can say I'm glad about

00:15:09.15 that magic I'm thankful for that gorged isn't gorged isn't that what you know

00:15:14.02 that's work yeah that's gorgeous you get gorgeous

00:15:18.00 gourd I think is what you're trying to say you know you can say

00:15:22.13 isn't gorging like stuffing your face that's it it is that's if you're it is

00:15:26.23 you're right isn't that the wrong thing forging it is

00:15:29.18 not stuffing the face of the ball that would also be a pleasant not what I

00:15:33.18 intended I meant the stab card not the Ethan gord if you just get swallowed

00:15:38.02 home that would be terrible god damn if I was

00:15:41.06 going to get killed by a bull I'd want it to hit me with the horn and not be

00:15:45.11 swallowed I'd feel disrespected if I got eaten by nobody gets eaten by ball I

00:15:49.05 appreciate Andrew that you put it into perspective and that you at the first

00:15:53.15 you thought I had a shitty week and magic didn't help and then you real you

00:15:57.08 you took another look at it and you said no wait a minute maybe I had maybe the

00:16:00.15 magic did help and it would have been that much work I had a similar event

00:16:06.02 happen to me yesterday I clued you guys into it a little bit uh was it yesterday

00:16:11.11 the day before yesterday and uh at first it I I looked at it as a terrible

00:16:15.18 terrible event but then I was able to reframe it and see that there was there

00:16:21.09 was a way to make lemonade out of that anal lemon and I'm really

00:16:24.19 excited to share that with you guys right now if you would so indulgent I

00:16:29.14 just want to say there's no magic of what you're about to do

00:16:34.08 oh I think that there is I well first off I have the world has been asking Geoff

00:16:39.00 we loved beef bracelet we loved it it was the best are they what are you gonna

00:16:44.17 follow up beef breakfast with we want to know we can't wait and I'm like it

00:16:49.14 doesn't work that way ma inspiration has to strike right sometimes it has to

00:16:54.13 strike at your lowest most painful embarrassing moments like

00:16:59.09 uh let me just say inspiration struck and here's how

00:17:02.01 the other day I was riding my bike I got up I've been riding my bike on a tear

00:17:05.08 Gavin I went with you and Trevor the other day we had a lot of fun riding

00:17:08.07 bikes since then I've averaged more than

00:17:10.12 one bike ride a day the other day I went I got up I went for a 27 mile bike ride

00:17:15.12 uh first thing in the morning then I had a

00:17:17.18 full day had a great productive day at work and then Emily at millie's with her

00:17:21.13 mom this week and Emily was working late and I was kind of home alone and bored

00:17:26.19 and I thought oh I'm gonna go for another bike ride because I feel pretty

00:17:31.18 good uh and I I currently have like a uh gallons of tiger balm ultra

00:17:37.01 because my lower back has been hurting a bit and so I've been slathering it on

00:17:42.09 lately uh something that also happens is I that

00:17:45.22 I'm aware of and if you ride a lot of bikes you'll you'll understand this if

00:17:49.10 you ride your bike I don't know 50 miles in a day it makes your butthole hurt

00:17:54.02 like the the seat of your butt it makes your like you're

00:17:57.17 like where your butt like your butt flap hurt yeah and uh and it makes it really

00:18:02.07 sore and so I thought you know what before I get on this [ __ ] bike I'm

00:18:07.09 gonna big brain this I have all this tiger bomb ultra I put it on my spine

00:18:12.10 all night long to help me out there I'm gonna rub it on my butt cheeks so that

00:18:18.10 they don't ever get sore I've lost so much sympathy for your

00:18:21.17 situation this is not okay so wait it's the cheeks that hurt so my butt cheeks

00:18:26.22 I'm getting there so when you ride the bike too much I was anticipating a butt

00:18:33.03 cheek hurt so I put the tiger bomb on my butt cheeks then I hopped on my bike my

00:18:36.21 butt was humming it was on fire in a good way you know what it's like I was

00:18:41.17 loving it and so I started a pedaling and a pedaling and I'm having a great

00:18:45.22 time you know it's Austin and it's five in

00:18:48.23 the evening which is like the hottest part of the day in Austin so it's like

00:18:52.20 118 or whatever and after about oh I don't know six or seven minutes I start

00:18:57.19 to sweat and uh that's when all of the sweat on

00:19:02.00 my body poured across my butt cheeks and then into my butthole

00:19:08.10 and with it it brought the furious pain of a thousand cuts

00:19:14.00 into the into my anus I it must have been a half a gallon a tiger bomb in

00:19:19.22 liquid form went right into my butthole this happened while you were riding

00:19:24.23 it was while I was I was three miles three I rode it was well I'll tell ya I

00:19:30.02 did 22 miles that that ride so uh 22 and a half miles so uh because I did a an

00:19:35.11 even 50. Yeah so is your anus not facing down though I was just defying ground I

00:19:41.10 was like three minutes in or like three miles in when it started

00:19:45.16 to hurt and then uh and and as you know with me uh I'm not

00:19:50.06 gonna stop the bike ride when I wrecked that day in the ice I didn't stop the

00:19:56.04 bike ride I plugged the holes with mud and ice and I kept riding right so I was

00:20:01.17 like I can't turn around now that would be admitting defeat I'm just gonna gr

00:20:05.12 I'm just gonna grin and [ __ I get through it and I'm texting you guys

00:20:08.21 while I'm riding and you know like sharing my pain with you and it just

00:20:13.09 gets worse and worse and then I didn't even tell you guys this part then

00:20:16.19 something a realization hit me after everything kind of like it gets

00:20:21.07 hot you know and like tingly and then it kind of goes numb then I realized what

00:20:26.23 is what does icy hot do what does tiger bum do when it soothes your muscles your

00:20:31.05 sore tense muscles it releases them it makes them numb and then it makes

00:20:35.21 them not tense and then I thought I have numbed and unleashed I've numbed and

00:20:40.22 untensed my [ __ ] you gotta plug that hole with mud right after the shower

00:20:44.18 incident right after the shower incident

00:20:47.16 where I [ __ ] which by the way Emily had so much fun telling you guys all the

00:20:51.04 gross details last night uh and then I so and then and then I'm

00:20:55.12 sweating so I'm just wet I'm just hot and wet everywhere and I'm thinking I is

00:21:00.02 my butthole leaking am I just leaking ass juice am I pooping as I ride and I

00:21:05.01 thought I'm just not going to look down I'm just not going to look down and I'm

00:21:08.08 just going to finish my ride and I'll just figure it out when I get home it's

00:21:11.12 like he had to die where he like knocks the gas cap off the

00:21:15.03 plane and then lights on fire Geoff's just leaving a [ __ ] trail on his bike

00:21:19.12 I mean maybe I was maybe I wasn't I don't know and I wrote all around town

00:21:22.18 lake and I thought like well as long as no but like

00:21:25.12 at least I'm looking at people eye to eye I don't get to I don't have to see

00:21:28.16 their reaction when they see behind me right and I'm riding fast so it's like I

00:21:33.03 just got to get through this and so I you know were you trying to clench or it

00:21:37.00 was the is it the clench that you couldn't feel or you don't I couldn't

00:21:40.06 feel it I couldn't feel it I couldn't feel

00:21:42.15 I didn't know if I was clinching or not so you you could have been clenching but

00:21:45.18 you just didn't yeah it's like when you it's like when you sleep on your arm

00:21:48.21 wrong and you wake up and you have no control over your arm for 45 seconds

00:21:52.13 that's what icy hot does to your butthole or in this case tiger balm uh

00:21:57.18 and so yeah I just did my butthole was asleep like my ain't my my ring

00:22:02.09 was asleep for you know it's two hours or however long I was on the bike ride

00:22:06.11 wait uh maybe I was about an hour the whole ride was about an hour and a half

00:22:09.12 so I'm probably about an hour and fifteen minutes maybe an hour and ten an

00:22:14.21 hour and ten uh anyway got home uh and just so you guys know

00:22:18.23 I I ran straight to the shower uh and uh and I was completely clean

00:22:24.02 totally fine and at some point it stopped hurting and I'll also say uh

00:22:28.23 my butt cheeks never hurt the entire time like that 50 mile bike ride and

00:22:34.02 I've been on two bike rides since then butt cheeks have been fine all week so

00:22:38.02 in the end uh it worked now that's not my reason it clearly didn't work

00:22:42.14 what do you mean it worked also you said my butt cheeks never hurt I said you're

00:22:46.03 perfectly clean you had like a paste of sweat and tiger bomb all over your ass

00:22:50.19 yeah I mean I had sweat I was I rode a bike for two hours in the sun of course

00:22:54.21 I mean I didn't have [ __ ] on me I didn't have poopies anywhere I didn't have

00:22:58.17 diarrhea I didn't leave a trail of poop breadcrumbs like I did in the

00:23:02.14 [ __ ] hotel in Vegas none of that it was just that part was clean but anyway

00:23:07.09 through the course of talking to you guys and I was telling you guys I needed

00:23:12.02 relief Andrew you recommended I put milk in my butt because uh

00:23:16.08 that's what you do with jalapenos right you drink milk uh so and when I in that

00:23:21.03 time that I got jalapenos on my dick I stuck my dick in milk uh and that did

00:23:25.16 help I think I told you that story once or maybe it was on a different podcast

00:23:30.10 and I was like yeah but how am I gonna put milk in my butthole and then you

00:23:33.18 were like well you could take a milk bath and I was like dude I got another

00:23:36.21 20 miles of this bike ride to go I'm gonna be doing that anytime soon and I

00:23:40.02 also who's got enough milk to who's got enough milk to fill a bathtub certainly

00:23:44.02 not me uh so uh but anyway in the course of that

00:23:47.23 inspiration struck and I came up with what I think is and nick has heard none

00:23:52.14 of this uh so this will he I'll get him's unfiltered opinion which I'm

00:23:56.06 really excited about I came up with an idea for a product I'm gonna I'm just

00:24:00.21 gonna go ahead and without saying it I'm

00:24:04.10 just gonna go and post the images I I've made uh

00:24:07.13 I made uh I made a logo for it I'll do that one first no

00:24:12.04 and then I made like a tag line and uh I did some photography for it and I here

00:24:17.08 here's the here's the product how do I okay catch an image it looks that's

00:24:23.22 horrifying upload file it looks like a pasta it

00:24:29.16 looks like oh you guys can see it icicles

00:24:34.03 okay I present to you the two spicy icy this is an all dairy product what I have

00:24:39.07 done is I took a turkey baster and I took the top off and I filled the turkey

00:24:44.23 base while I taped the bottom of it then I filled it with milk pure milk

00:24:49.05 and then I stuck I stuck a uh a stick in it and I froze it and what I've created

00:24:55.03 is a long cylindrical device I call the too spicy icy if you have a sore

00:24:59.11 butthole because maybe you ate spicy food last night I know I do that all the

00:25:03.09 time maybe you had some Memphis hot chicken or maybe you had some extra

00:25:07.05 spicy uh jalapenos on your nachos or maybe you rub tiger balm all up in your

00:25:11.07 [ __ ] I know how to solve it you can stick you can take this all dairy

00:25:15.20 product and shove it gently into you it will cool you and has

00:25:20.08 your added benefit of think about this what does milk do for you guys what does

00:25:25.05 it do for you strengthens it builds strong bones and a

00:25:29.18 healthy smile what's the most important bone in your body your spine what a

00:25:35.12 [ __ ] awesome way to get a calcium injection

00:25:38.03 right up your spine it's gonna make you stronger it's gonna take away your butt

00:25:43.10 pain and it goes even better because here's the next image oh no

00:25:48.06 here's the next image oh I like this one I'm really excited about this one

00:25:53.12 from the fine folks at uniform let the milk from our cows soothe your anus owls

00:25:59.03 see and there's a cow as a picture of a cow in the snow this is great for a

00:26:02.18 couple of reasons right that's a catchy slogan let the milk from our cows soothe

00:26:07.14 your anus out and we barely have talked about it but as

00:26:11.01 you know from beef bracelet which is a subsidiary of face industries which is a

00:26:17.05 subsidiary of fluke face which is a subsidiary of a highly secretive very

00:26:21.21 rarely talked about but often alluded to company uh called uniform uniforms

00:26:27.01 combining the fabric of the farm with the power of one uniform this is another

00:26:33.12 perfect uniform product we make the milk that we freeze that you put in you and

00:26:39.12 because I had so much fun last time making the video for uh you know I made

00:26:44.13 a spec video uh to show how we would promote and how uh how beef bracelet

00:26:48.14 would work I made a little commercial for you guys so I'm gonna submit this

00:26:52.19 here's a video for you to watch it's real short oh my file's too powerful how

00:26:56.16 do I do that all right I'll put it in uh here's what I'll do I'll put it in

00:27:01.01 you're gonna slack back yeah slack I'm so are you done with images

00:27:05.11 I'm done with image every time you have another image I'm waiting to see you

00:27:10.00 with a Popsicle in your ass I really don't want to see it so I'm glad I'm

00:27:15.01 glad watch this video oh no all right uh it's uploading oh there it is

00:27:20.15 okay I gotta go to slack oh god oh there's so many flaws with this plan

00:27:26.18 the the turkey baster shape is all it is because it's pointed at the end it just

00:27:31.10 looks like a milk spike it looks like the last thing I would want anywhere

00:27:35.04 near my anus so I understand what you're saying and I think that the different

00:27:40.06 people are going to have different anal tastes for that kind of thing I get that

00:27:43.20 I also think that there's room uh for us to consider making uh and I don't have

00:27:48.17 one at home so I couldn't make a prototype of it easily but uh to kind of

00:27:52.06 consider making uh like a pacifier that you could just kind of pop in right and

00:27:56.04 that kind of cradles your butthole video is uploaded I would like you to please

00:28:01.05 watch it now uh all right watching this I'll watch it too [Laughter]

00:28:14.04 it's so long

00:28:23.18 firstly it's way too long to it's only 37 seconds no not lengthened video the

00:28:30.10 ice freaking spike would skewer the back of your anus it

00:28:34.17 would it would hit the base that's gonna get you no see that's the

00:28:39.10 nice thing about it is it it's gonna come with uh and I like I'm glad that

00:28:43.11 you brought that up I we're gonna make it like people are different sizes so

00:28:47.08 what you do is you sell a one size fits all but then we include what I'd like to

00:28:52.23 call it's almost like a cigar cutter right and then you can cut it to the

00:28:56.03 length of your preferred anal uh depth it's awful yes you just go like cl cluck

00:29:01.18 cut cut cut you can just cut it down to the size that works for you

00:29:05.11 and uh and I'll be honest with you I I'm

00:29:07.11 being totally honest I said I think that might be the best video I've ever made

00:29:11.03 in my life I'm so happy with it I'm so proud of it I feel like I've done such a

00:29:15.05 good job of relaying what's happening and how [ __ ] relieved and soothed I am

00:29:20.23 without being graphic it looks like one of wolverine's claws before the

00:29:26.10 adamantium.

00:29:30.19 I like that you brought up Gavin that it is going to just stab your anus and

00:29:36.02 Geoff's response of listen I hear you but

00:29:41.22 you didn't solve anything you just created a new problem and then created

00:29:46.08 an even worse solution for that problem and it's just gonna freeze or burn your

00:29:50.11 sensitive anus skin it's gonna shred your ass from the cold and from the

00:29:55.06 spike it's probably second to a knife in terms of things [Laughter]

00:30:01.14 well I don't know I don't know we're gonna have to focus test it I think that

00:30:06.01 uh I think that that might be a little harsh I think that you might find that

00:30:09.14 there are a lot of people who would appreciate the soothing nature of uh dairy

00:30:14.07 I could just like as soon as it goes in it's like anally licking a pole in the

00:30:20.01 winter it just gets stuck [Laughter]

00:30:25.11 I think you're also uh forgetting how warm it is inside your butthole that's

00:30:30.12 why people check temperatures though it's gonna melt very quickly it might

00:30:35.14 melt as fast as you kind of put it in it's like the worst survivor challenge

00:30:42.13 when people stand over a plate [Laughter]

00:30:48.02 show me the stick uh Geoff I think now I will say I will say that stick

00:30:54.15 would would I would not recommend the stick I used I used a skewer like you put

00:31:00.13 you're trying to sell it inside your

00:31:07.05 well that's all I had that's what I'm saying it's a prototype kitty thing

00:31:12.13 that's all I have they can even use around it [Applause]

00:31:16.06 I love everything I've made these are fantastic products I already asked Aaron

00:31:21.15 yesterday if we can sell uh frozen products

00:31:28.00 you don't know that yet the audience hasn't responded

00:31:32.04 I'm telling you there's there's a there's seven and a half billion people

00:31:37.10 on earth I can't be the only one that sees the value in this you don't even

00:31:41.12 like milk no I don't I don't like milk at all

00:31:44.09 are we gonna set an excellent point but but you know what I do like thanks for

00:31:48.01 asking I like lactose free milk because that lets me eat cereal again without

00:31:51.19 having the tummy aches right we've talked about that that's why I have all

00:31:55.12 the captain crunch now thanks to Andrew you'll notice in the gorgeous picture

00:32:00.19 that I created for the two spicy icy logo there is both

00:32:04.19 milk there's both lactose full and lactose free milk displayed

00:32:08.04 giving the impression uh that we would make a lactose free option for people

00:32:11.23 like myself what about chocolate is there going to be like a chocolate

00:32:15.11 version of this can we have a variety of flavor like what is the end what is the

00:32:20.13 end goal how much I think it'll I think it's going to

00:32:23.14 become chocolate on its own Geoff do you think you could tell what percent milk

00:32:28.15 - it is by shoving it in your [ __ ] - frozen.

00:32:32.00 I don't think so the worst magic trick I think the only thing you could take

00:32:38.01 from it is the grip level.

00:32:43.07 [Applause]

00:36:50.08 two like if we made posters 24 by 36 posters

00:36:53.16 they would like yeah it would pop can we put this on a billboard somewhere no

00:36:59.03 context just I don't know why we can't I think

00:37:02.04 it's a great idea I think I think it's a great idea we should put it on a

00:37:07.18 billboard I own that image and I smudged out the heb logo on all the milks

00:37:11.12 yeah let's put on a billboard and see if anyone knows what it is

00:37:15.19 it should have been the number yeah absolutely

00:37:19.18 call to order now and then just know just see what the calls are

00:37:24.17 on their way to work be like hey do you see that too spicy icy billboard what do

00:37:30.06 you think that is I wish I wish we uh I wish we had like a

00:37:34.14 comment leaver in the audience who was like I don't know a billionaire and who

00:37:39.09 uh was occasionally like just gonna do that you know well that's what I'm

00:37:44.12 saying we should waste all of the the sponsor money on stuff like this

00:37:48.06 yeah you're right you're right instead of relying on the uh the made-up

00:37:52.17 billionaire to do it yeah that's a good point yeah take the company money if if

00:37:57.01 you show this to a hundred people what percentage do you think realizes

00:38:02.17 that this is an anal product zero there's no there's nothing

00:38:06.06 there's nothing about this you would never think that you would never make

00:38:10.00 that leap I love that you're saying this I'm right

00:38:13.20 there with you that's what that's part of the strength of it right catch up now

00:38:19.12 yeah no it is a positive you're right it's all about perspective Andrew we

00:38:23.18 discussed this magic is in the air buddy

00:38:26.03 magic is in the air we could put this on the Instagram and just type like where

00:39:07.16 yeah I mean if you wanted a milk Popsicle yeah sure

00:39:10.05 yeah but that's not what it's designed for I don't think it's designed for what

00:39:14.00 you're saying it's designed for it's on a skewer and it's I think I designed it

00:39:18.08 I think I designed it Andrew and I know what I designed it for I think you did a

00:39:53.04 oh what audio clip of uh from earlier I'll see if you can hear this okay

00:39:58.13 information he's posting interesting guiding light 15000 episodes Oprah

00:40:04.20 winfrey show 4500 Jerry springs show 5084. Interesting because on the Jerry

00:40:10.02 springer show Wikipedia page it's listed as 4969. I wonder if they roll in some

00:40:15.10 of the Steve show in that potentially what's the Steve show well you know that

00:40:20.12 cop that was like the security guy uh I'm playing the wrong bit.

00:40:28.10 I was like this is so long oh it started right after all right here we go what

00:40:34.10 I want like an episode breakdown book like it's just a fully every episode

00:40:39.15 written down and him giving little notes about each show just a giant

00:40:44.00 encyclopedia sized thing of trash hey man I don't know if you've I don't know

00:40:48.06 if you checked the trash lately but eric's got some conflicting information

00:40:53.03 wait you said trash yeah Geoff said I don't

00:40:56.17 even check the trash recently when he was talking about the chat

00:41:02.13 it seems like I would have done that on purpose but I can't come up with a

00:41:06.12 reason why

00:41:08.21 Eric said that was worth it I just like none of us do is we we've

00:41:15.03 got to pay attention on these yeah we can't let stuff like that pass it's hard

00:41:20.02 to listen while you're talking though it is pay attention [Laughter]

00:41:24.00 I'm just thankful nobody barked at Geoff what a relief yeah god that was a weird

00:41:28.19 thing man stop barking well anyway that's my next product I

00:41:33.05 can't promise when I'll have a third but uh you know a uniform's cranking away

00:41:37.16 well I'm going to start talking to some distributors if you're interested

00:41:42.04 in investing uh I I have a lead on a on a new on a

00:41:46.21 new product I'm not very far along I can tease it a little bit but I have

00:41:52.08 identified that uh one problem with this product could be

00:41:56.23 uh milk residue and what to do with it uh milk leakage so uh I'm thinking if

00:42:02.10 you could create like a a pair of milk pants that uh absorbs and recycles the

00:42:06.17 milk uh kind of like uh like the atreyu like Paula trejo's outfit in dune where

00:42:11.16 it like recycled all the pee and sweat into like drinkable water like if we

00:42:15.00 could maybe maybe come out with a way to filter the milk leakage into I don't

00:42:18.17 know you could water plants with it or something uh anyway but we're working on

00:42:22.05 that and uh anyway if you're interested in investing just let me know could I uh

00:42:26.12 potentially enhance the product Geoff just slightly always always

00:42:33.01 zero enthusiasm I don't think this should exist but if you're gonna make it

00:42:37.16 I feel like that's a much better scale an option

00:42:41.06 you can wear it it fits within the uniform as Gavin said not wearable

00:42:46.00 but you got that I like that that's that's what that is

00:42:49.12 is you use a wing pop uh I think a ring pop is very similar to a pacifier which

00:42:54.04 is what I was saying earlier and that's that's a great direction to go with it

00:42:57.12 thanks I appreciate it I agree because it's not as deep and there's an easy way

00:43:01.12 to get it out yeah and it's also a little wider you know for a heftier person

00:43:05.16 you know not all butt holes are the same size so you know I don't think anything

00:43:09.21 needs to go past the sphincter I think it's all surface level tingles and

00:43:14.12 numbness yeah I don't think anything these I don't think anything's going

00:43:17.21 inside your anus it's it's just the end of the anus that feels the spice I don't

00:43:21.16 know like you don't feel the spice I feel like myself

00:43:24.20 I felt like I felt it pretty deep uh yesterday or day before how how many

00:43:30.00 inches up the oh maybe maybe like an inch up

00:43:33.08 maybe a ring pops the way then taking it

00:43:36.02 back to the beginning of this I just I'd I'd love to hear

00:43:38.16 Eric and gavin's thoughts so we got a text leading into this of Geoff just

00:43:44.02 saying that he got tiger bomb in his [ __ ] what did you imagine

00:43:48.08 the context of that was did you think like did you put any thought into it I

00:43:52.04 personally I thought it was a thing where like he applied it to a part of

00:43:55.14 his body didn't fully remove it from his finger and then like wiped his ass and

00:44:00.11 accidentally got it I thought it'd be like when you eat something spicy you

00:44:03.21 accidentally touch your eyes yeah no exactly that's what I assumed I never

00:44:08.08 would have guessed that this happened in the middle of a bike ride it was a

00:44:12.00 solution for numbing the fact that he applied it to the ass area

00:44:16.21 is shocking oh you didn't realize I had done that no I assumed it was much more

00:44:21.16 accidental I lost all sympathy for you in your prayers it was an accident it

00:44:25.02 was an accident no but you put it you put the tiger bomb in a danger zone and

00:44:29.08 you paid the price you played with fire and it happened it wasn't like

00:44:34.00 where it was supposed to be listen first off I uh uh I don't know

00:44:38.23 that it matters how it got there absolutely what matters what matters is

00:44:43.21 that it's there and that I'm dealing with it and suffering in the moment who

00:44:49.12 cares how it happened I just I I don't and to call it a fix

00:44:53.09 it's like you burnt your hands put on gloves and then burnt the rest of your

00:44:57.19 body and was like I fixed the issue my hands are fine it's like what do you

00:45:02.06 think I don't I don't think that that's uh accurate at all huh

00:45:06.08 it's ridiculous how does that make that makes no sense

00:45:10.17 I don't burn your butthole you put sue it's the same thing I put my dick in

00:45:15.05 when I got jalapeño juice on it I know I assume it's gonna work exactly the same

00:45:20.17 that was just liquid milk though wasn't it yeah

00:45:24.08 were you just dunking your [ __ ] and balls in a cup yeah

00:45:27.18 so what's stopping you for just like sticking your legs either side of your

00:45:31.20 head and just pouring a shot of milk into your oh ring that's essentially

00:45:35.17 what I'm doing but it's a lot less messy the way I'm doing it

00:45:40.00 do you have it do you have a milk funnel for your butthole specifically

00:45:45.10 what I also don't have an ice cube tray that's my butthole funnel

00:45:50.13 you don't need one because you'll buy the product from me you're not making it

00:45:56.10 yourself you're buying it from me or from the dillard like from

00:45:59.14 you probably will probably buy it from cvs or hdb or wherever randall's

00:46:03.23 whatever grocery store you go to probably have some sort of a I would

00:46:07.05 assume like oh maybe like a linens and things or like bed bath and beyond I

00:46:11.03 could see us being there I I'm just much more on board with andrew's uh ring pop

00:46:17.03 yeah sting pop the sting pop I like I like that the two spicy icy icy plug

00:46:22.12 nick said is good as well sting pop I think what we do is we workshop names

00:46:25.20 you know uh all about that I also I I while I like I I do kind of like the the

00:46:31.01 jewel shape of it though I hope I hope rings doesn't have

00:46:34.21 is it the bellagio in Vegas that has that fountain and outside of it that

00:46:40.00 shoots the water up I'm just imagining that with milk yeah

00:46:44.07 that's what we need for our launch part 17 dude I think the end of ocean's 11

00:46:50.02 significantly better oh anyway uh what uh what do you guys got I

00:46:56.15 oh I don't I don't know how to follow that up Geoff

00:47:00.17 well what about your homework Andrew oh Eric's got a question oh Eric has a

00:47:05.14 question yes sir just quickly and then we can move on to andrew's homework um

00:47:11.07 you said specifically that this was to stop your tiger bomb burn is that right

00:47:16.10 in this instance yes it would be to soothe the tiger bomb burn but I also

00:47:21.03 then immediately realized that when I have too spicy food my butthole burns in

00:47:26.13 a similar way and so I I think that it would work for

00:47:30.04 that as well does milk help ice like tiger balm

00:47:35.01 I don't I don't know I was I figured that we would find out but it definitely

00:47:40.00 but it definitely helps jalapeño burn right

00:47:43.09 and nick is sort of driving at what I was

00:47:46.17 kind of wanting to know is did you test this oh no no no

00:47:54.15 by the time you should by the I feel like by the time I got it all by the

00:48:00.07 time I got the milk frozen I felt fine oh what did you do to soothe the burn I

00:48:05.07 waited it out oh you just waited yeah oh

00:48:07.11 okay I like the idea of this it's not it it's the pain is over so soon that you

00:48:12.01 don't have time to pour the milk and freeze it you need to have one of these

00:48:15.07 in your freezer plenty of time before the milk can freeze it I just didn't I

00:48:18.12 was you have to realize I also had a another hour and a half bike ride before

00:48:22.15 I got home to even get to the mill and I had to conceive of the product I

00:48:27.10 had to build the structure I had to find tape that was bought like waterproof

00:48:32.12 that was a thing it was it took a while it sounds to me like you have homework

00:48:36.04 this week Geoff well you have homework let's talk about I had homework yeah

00:48:40.12 yeah well I mean it's not much to talk about I mean

00:48:44.10 turns out jet skis are expensive yes they are

00:48:47.11 we do that yeah well I'm working on it I can't you know it's not an immediate

00:48:52.21 process I'm working I'm throwing I'm throwing things out there I'm trying my

00:48:56.04 best I've expanded so I think we need to maybe reevaluate this

00:49:00.18 stunt a little bit and think about where our floor is like

00:49:04.22 what are we happy with with a base thing so I

00:49:08.16 I kind of want to cover the bases I haven't I'm still working

00:49:12.00 I'll get a response eventually I'll figure out I didn't know what to put the

00:49:15.22 subject line of the email for this uh but I'm covering everything so we got jet

00:49:21.13 skis I've reached out to a few jet ski places I also just to make sure we have

00:49:26.18 something have a floor have also reached out to a few electric wheelchair

00:49:30.12 companies I figured you guys could scoot on by each other and give a little high

00:49:34.14 five so we got a we got a ground level because they're a lot I think they're

00:49:39.05 cheaper they're significantly you could just

00:49:42.00 take them and so we I mean an omelet is cheaper we don't want one what do you

00:49:45.16 mean well it sounds to me like you guys

00:49:48.20 really wanted to do this high five while passing each other

00:49:52.10 I think I would hey I'd love for it to be a jet ski I'd be a big fan of that

00:49:56.18 but you know sometimes it doesn't work out though you don't replace a jet ski

00:50:01.01 with an electric scooter you replace a chest

00:50:04.10 we have a floor Geoff the floor is the I tell you what the floor is the water

00:50:09.18 surface it's got to be oh it's gonna float well

00:50:13.10 you didn't give me that instruction you just said get a jet ski and you know jet

00:50:17.15 skis are expensive get a jet ski is that instruction no I thought the real heart

00:50:22.06 and goal of this mission was to have you two high five while going in different

00:50:25.20 directions Andrew we could do that on foot yeah but nobody wants to see that

00:50:29.23 on foot there's a vehicle involved in some way some form of transportation and

00:50:34.16 so I just wanted to start on a ground level if you can float an electric

00:50:38.08 scooter I'm all about it I mean it doesn't have to be a jet ski as long as

00:50:42.10 it's floats and it has it and it's propelled

00:50:44.14 in in a world where people are shoving milk icicles up their ass I don't see

00:50:49.20 why I can't get a floating I don't either I I

00:50:53.20 believe in the uh ingenuity of Andrew panton okay so you want it has to be on

00:50:59.21 the water specifically it can't happen on land like it's not just the high five

00:51:05.03 because you brought up bike jets it's the high five mixed it's

00:51:09.13 the high five mixed wait which which stunt are we doing are we doing the one

00:51:13.15 where I'm on my bicycle and we do the high five the bike and the jet ski cross

00:51:17.04 in the air I couldn't remember if eric's [ __ ] on that or not I thought we're

00:51:20.12 doing hands on a stick on jet skis hands on a stick and a jet ski okay cool

00:51:24.07 because I wanted to go more extreme with

00:51:26.12 it but I remember Eric being all like oh

00:51:29.05 I'm scared of extreme stuff and stuff so uh

00:51:33.01 okay so yeah no that should probably be uh two jet skis or maybe two boats of

00:51:36.21 some kind okay speed but speed those boats are gonna be easy to get okay no

00:51:41.11 I'll you know what I'll uh I'll go back to the lab I'll continue with my

00:51:44.12 homework you have homework too I'll come back with an update next week I reached

00:51:48.07 out to a few places haven't heard back didn't even hear back from the

00:51:51.07 wheelchair company that doesn't actually I don't actually want to put this in my

00:51:54.11 butt well you made it I thought I thought you're promoting it no well it's too

00:51:58.21 late I thought I thought that I thought doing all the work the other work I did

00:52:03.02 was enough no I think just get a finger tip of tiger balm around the anus dude I

00:52:07.09 don't want to I don't I don't do not want to do that again but you

00:52:12.21 made a whole product video yeah it has to be tested you literally made the

00:52:17.18 product

00:52:20.08 the whole point of the product is so you can do this and then relieve yourself

00:52:24.20 from the side effects of it what do you mean you don't want to do it again

00:52:29.11 do you really want a comment lever to be

00:52:31.09 the first person to stick a milk I don't even know it has to be you I don't like

00:52:36.13 that being out there I don't think that I I don't think

00:52:39.17 anyone I consult a professional what do you mean you just we're dealing

00:52:43.16 with frozen dates this whole episode is about the product it's on spec it has it

00:52:47.13 we haven't gone it hasn't gotten you just

00:52:50.01 a professional what do you mean I wonder what the professional will say

00:52:54.12 I don't know they're not gonna say yes Geoff I do know this

00:52:59.03 it needs to be open and closed by you Geoff look we need we need closure on

00:53:05.02 this all right I'll think about it

00:53:07.22 I'll think about it the point of the pro what are you doing what are you talking

00:53:14.00 about what do you mean what am I talking about you just pitched I just listened

00:53:18.09 for 30 minutes you talk about how great this product is and then we ask you to

00:53:23.09 use it and you're like I don't want to go seek a professional what are you

00:53:27.14 talking about what was this episode

00:53:30.12 nick's saying I should be behind the curtain and have Emily record my

00:53:34.22 reaction oh man oh yeah that's like an

00:53:38.12 old Howard stern [ __ ] nick you know what you're doing oh

00:53:42.16 that's like Scott the engineer and the porn star Lexington is extreme no

00:53:50.23 I also love the flip of this Geoff came in so excited to talk about this product

00:53:56.05 and he's now dreading it you've gone too far only going about an inch in anyway

00:53:59.20 yeah and you know what the milk you could tell you could pull out you could see

00:54:04.00 how far you went it could be like a combine stat I think uh

00:54:08.00 I think we've been going long pretty long I think uh yeah we're

00:54:12.04 probably at time okay well I don't think that changes

00:54:15.09 anything as far as your homework guess does anybody else have anything else

00:54:19.01 they want to cover I talked about magic well um I'm doing a podcast

00:54:24.10 what's happening well sort of not really so I got somebody somebody messaged me

00:54:31.03 and asked if I could help with a college project thing that they were working on

00:54:35.18 and I've had this happen a few times typically it's just like they ask some

00:54:39.01 questions and it's like an interview type thing

00:54:41.13 uh so that's just someone who wants to talk to you well you know it's a it's

00:54:46.02 part of an assignment it's different than just talking to me

00:54:49.21 and I have somebody asked and that they're like hey could you help with

00:54:53.11 this thing and I said sure and then they said okay

00:54:56.15 uh would you do a podcast with me which is not what I was expecting I thought

00:55:00.08 it'd just be a few questions I said okay

00:55:02.06 I could I could probably do that what is the podcast on and then they replied

00:55:07.16 I've got no idea what do you think we should do okay so if you guys have

00:55:12.17 podcast ideas I could use this I could take this

00:55:15.22 what I don't understand what do you mean why are you confused by this

00:55:19.19 I'm doing one episode of a podcast for a college assignment with this person I

00:55:23.11 don't know what it should be about what should the topic be uh

00:55:27.22 I'm telling you it's not gonna be about anal icicles or whatever whatever that

00:55:32.20 was french revolution okay Spanish American war Spanish American war that's

00:55:37.14 and that's why you're going to learn so that you can make an entertaining

00:55:41.01 podcast enriched just make a sports podcast and

00:55:44.01 then everyone will be happy that it's not on this I guess I'm not really clear

00:55:48.06 on that what if I did sports and survivor perfect that's great um

00:55:53.02 that really didn't go anywhere I feel like it would have been better if I said

00:55:56.13 nothing what do you mean why did you think it was gonna go somewhere I just

00:56:00.03 it's Geoff was like does anyone have anything and I was thinking well what's

00:56:03.11 happened recently and I brought that up and everybody it was like I [ __ ]

00:56:08.04 popped all the balloons in the room and it just went dead

00:56:13.01 my attempt to bring anything beyond what

00:56:15.07 Geoff said was actually a negative result I would have been better off just not

00:56:21.05 saying a word that I was trying to say something is what I'm saying

00:56:24.14 Eric has your butthole been lately no no more butthole we're done with the

00:56:29.12 bundles Andrew is so so disappointed that no one wanted to

00:56:34.23 help him invent a new podcast everybody someone else everybody gave you an idea

00:56:41.16 what more do you want you need to produce

00:56:54.19 but there was a level of disgust by everybody in this call and I'm just

00:56:59.22 trying to talk about a thing I'll be Andrew can I can I dispel

00:57:04.21 something right now absolutely if you picked up on any uh any kind of uh

00:57:10.00 impression that I was disgusted uh with you making a high school project

00:57:15.16 or a college project with some kid uh uh it had zero to do with that and more to

00:57:20.21 do with the fact that I am running through how in my head

00:57:25.05 how much I love this how how much do I actually care about this podcast and can

00:57:31.00 I physically put a [ __ ] milk Popsicle up my butthole for a bit or not

00:57:36.11 and if not how do I get out of it and I realized that I painted myself in my

00:57:42.15 [ __ ] corner here and I'm just obviously not listening

00:57:45.23 dead I stare just thinking I'm just struggling about I'm thinking about oh

00:57:49.17 I'm thinking about how my id my how my joke went wrong and and I thought it was

00:57:54.19 very right I disagree that it went wrong yeah I think so

00:57:58.18 you were picking up on something else picking up on something else I can't

00:58:01.21 wait for you to not do this and I I'm excited to see what the comment levers

00:58:07.07 yell at you I have eat the pencil pencils what is I already had

00:58:10.17 that I had this stupid I had the goddamn port a potty put a graphite through the

00:58:15.14 middle of the ice spike and we're in the same situation [Laughter]

00:58:20.02 I'm trying to decide if I would trade with Geoff I I don't think that he had

00:58:24.07 the port a potty I got [ __ ] on for the port a potty forever well not really buy

00:58:29.22 it like and and and and I had the goddamn dipping sauce controversy

00:58:34.05 but that was largely just a miscommunication I think we both thought

00:58:38.01 the other person was doing a bit and we both were confused I don't think that

00:58:41.22 that was

00:58:43.18 that was just us being confused genuinely I was thinking about it Geoff

00:58:49.14 do you think that's the most heated conversation we've had

00:58:53.11 in the entirety of our friendship you and I can't think of any yeah I

00:58:58.08 can't think of a single thing imagine we've ever even come close yeah

00:59:03.11 it's just of all things the fact that pencil pencil [ __ ] you know

00:59:08.19 the only time we've ever even come close to heated has been for comedy yeah

00:59:14.03 but I feel like that that was not that was like one that extended beyond that

00:59:18.11 gather now on the other hand I'll I hate that [ __ ] half the time I'm

00:59:23.16 around him uh Henry it's okay for me what what'd you say

00:59:27.00 I don't think that's like an argument henry's barking at a [ __ ] toy

00:59:30.09 although Gavin doesn't even know I have a [ __ ] cat for 20 years so I don't

00:59:33.11 know what we'd argue about I don't think

00:59:35.11 he never told me I definitely did it was in episode three or whatever the show

00:59:41.05 you've been told that it's like a part of some story that's about you eating

00:59:45.03 [ __ ] in a bathroom isn't it the cat's not the bit you pay attention to the

00:59:48.09 whole point I was in the bathroom was the cat it's the center of the story

00:59:53.11 that is true that is true I met you coolio three times [Laughter]

00:59:59.03 you're right that was once again that was you know what Geoff I now apologize

01:00:03.10 to you because that was my icicle thing I was stunned by the fact that Gavin

01:00:09.03 didn't know Nazi drew so I was just in the cloud scatterbrained

01:00:12.14 podcast this this should be the last thing you listen to if you've just

01:00:17.18 recovered from a stroke this is one of the worst podcasts to follow it's

01:00:21.11 completely incoherent you know you know what's interesting about this podcast

01:00:26.12 though that I'll say is that the the waves that we ride and then crest and go

01:00:30.06 on and how they change right like you're

01:00:34.02 right this is a scatterbrained mess of a podcast right now

01:00:37.06 what's confusing to me disparate ideas that I feel like we have like little

01:00:41.09 tendrils of of comedy bits that we could go and then we just die on the vine

01:00:45.01 because we get distracted by somebody jangling their keys over here and then

01:00:48.06 we go to the other thing uh I feel like that's where we are right now but like

01:00:52.19 previously I was thinking about this I there was a good period of I don't know

01:00:57.17 of this podcast where I no longer trusted either of you to the point where

01:01:01.06 I didn't want to have a conversation with you outside of the podcast because

01:01:04.12 I didn't I couldn't trust the conversation and I don't feel that way

01:01:07.09 at all right now and that was like Eric says that was like months I feel like

01:01:11.04 we're totally past that wave of distrust and backstabbing and now we're all just

01:01:16.02 uh just chasing squirrels I mean there was says

01:01:20.19 even nickelodeon nick says even he was on edge

01:01:25.05 is this our like our paranoia refractory period yeah I think so do I talk about

01:01:30.21 the thing I talked about when Geoff left yesterday or last time we did this I

01:01:35.22 bring that up no what was that there there's a thing

01:01:38.09 there's you know maybe uh a little bit of scheme of sorts that's talked about

01:01:43.18 that was that was decided not worth doing you didn't do it no well no maybe.

01:01:49.14 [Music]

01:01:50.17 I don't

01:01:55.12 that was so unconvincing that it didn't bother me in the least either way no

01:02:01.09 that's fine

01:02:04.13 also Eric wants us to plug the scrumping signs are coming soon

01:02:10.02 I just did that they're not in the store yet but by the time this is out

01:02:15.01 hopefully but Eric

01:02:18.06 no one's gonna be listening to this on the 23rd of September Eric [Laughter]

01:02:24.10 happy birthday Millie ramsay by the way today happy birthday today my daughter

01:02:29.20 turned 6516 years old sweetie Millie ramsay September 23rd 2005 the world got

01:02:35.03 better uh but kid also oh I know one thing but the

01:02:39.05 bat knobs are coming out October 1st right that's a

01:02:42.23 note I had my phone I still don't understand it still doesn't make sense

01:02:48.10 but that's fine the bat knobs uh October 1st got us no scrumping signs uh I saw
