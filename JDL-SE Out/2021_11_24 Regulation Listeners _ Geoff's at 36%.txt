00:00:36.02 Hello and welcome to episode 78 of uh of the F**kFuckFacePodcast uh my name is Geoff

00:00:41.16 Ramsey my audio sounds good according to nick we had to do some tests earlier

00:00:44.15 because I had some weird uh device manager problems thanks nick uh with me

00:00:48.09 as always Andrew uh Payton and Gavin free uh this episode and the next one

00:00:52.05 because we're doing back to backs it gonna be a little weird and I'll tell

00:00:56.17 you why we didn't record last week whenever we skip a week the notes pile

00:01:01.07 up yeah I have more notes in my phone I think than I've ever had I went through

00:01:05.02 them last night with Emily and she was like holy [ __ ] I thought you were

00:01:08.13 kidding that is like that is way too much to talk about

00:01:11.09 and some stuff is time sensitive so it's slipping away but on top of that the

00:01:15.05 degree of difficulty Andrew I don't know

00:01:17.09 if you want to talk about it we couldn't film last week because you were ill

00:01:21.16 you're feeling better now I however am not feeling great oh no

00:01:26.13 well it's it's not I'm not sick it's that I have a colonoscopy tomorrow

00:01:30.12 scheduled and uh I'm in the middle of colonoscopy prep so I haven't eaten in a

00:01:35.20 couple of days and I'm I'm living off of a clear I'm

00:01:39.18 living off of white gatorade and uh and water right is that why you

00:01:44.12 weren't at the office earlier yeah I couldn't I well I was gonna come in and

00:01:48.12 record with y'all play a video game with y'all but uh yeah I gotta drink a bunch

00:01:51.14 of weird [ __ ] nick I'm in the middle of

00:01:54.02 drinking the weird [ __ ] uh but at that specific time this is the other reason

00:01:57.18 why it's gonna be interesting uh I don't think I've gone 15 minutes without

00:02:02.10 [ __ ] my brains out today really so so I tried to my damnedest to like explode

00:02:08.01 everything I could out of me before the recording but I might have to I might

00:02:14.02 have to leave for a little bit to shoot water violently out of my ass I will

00:02:18.23 at some point if there's one podcast that is established recording in a

00:02:23.11 bathroom you've already done this this is this is gonna be a round two for you

00:02:27.15 get the mic in there but god damn dude I woke up at about three this morning

00:02:33.05 ran to the bathroom and I don't think I left until 530. If you cut the sides

00:02:37.23 off of it is a port a potty really the worst desk chair I think that there's a

00:02:42.07 world in which that could work side off yeah well because you don't

00:02:45.18 want to be in a [ __ ] you're like boxed in it's like a phone booth if you

00:02:49.06 got the whole thing so if you cut the sides off and it's like a throne at that

00:02:53.09 point you slide the chair in why not just cut it in half like horizontally

00:02:58.01 what do you mean cut it in half well how is that different than what I'm saying

00:03:01.16 well with the sides off you still got a roof over it well now if you cut the

00:03:05.01 sides then there's clearly no roof what is supporting the roof if there are no

00:03:08.23 sides Gavin that was sort of an assumed uh you wouldn't um do I leave the back

00:03:12.13 up that's actually a great question I kind of like there's a little bit of a

00:03:16.23 sun you got a bat you want the bat um I don't know I think it would depend on

00:03:20.14 the port a potty right if your back rests against the back wall or not I think

00:03:24.17 it's too big for any desk you think so I think I could fit a port a

00:03:28.21 potty in here and well no that's that's in the room at all you could even get it

00:03:32.03 through the door that's yeah you know what uh honestly

00:03:35.12 getting it up the stairs would be the bigger issue I think I could get it in

00:03:39.01 the room we'd have to get a lift of some kind to

00:03:42.07 like bring it up to my level and then we would be okay I think do you think it

00:03:46.08 would hit the ceiling oh no I got really tall ceilings I got so much space going

00:03:50.19 up I'm good we don't really utilize ceiling space

00:03:54.03 either like what should I I feel like it's dead space now that you tell me

00:03:58.19 last night that we also waste door frames yeah frame doesn't do enough it's

00:04:02.17 true there is not enough door frames just exist I'd love your

00:04:06.17 opinion on this Geoff when have you ever seen a door frame be utilized for

00:04:10.15 anything outside of it being a door frame throw a light in there

00:04:14.21 throw a light in the frame yeah why not well you want to be like a status thing

00:04:20.01 like a progress thing I did a pull-up bar Eric just said pull apart that's a

00:04:24.13 great call it's a good use for a door frame or

00:04:27.05 halo the halo ranking system I was just saying it would be cool to have a visual

00:04:31.21 indicator of the bar and I figured like the door frame isn't

00:04:35.10 being used at all and it's like where you measure as a child we've been

00:04:39.07 playing halo infinite we've been watching our little rank bars go up and

00:04:42.19 Andrew was just like wouldn't it wouldn't this be great if instead of on

00:04:45.22 here it was on my frame and I was like what are you talking about and he was

00:04:49.08 equating it to like when a kid gets taller and you measure the height on the

00:04:53.09 wall it's we've it's it's well because Gavin

00:04:56.09 said I'm going up a bit and I thought of like oh as a kid like it was exciting

00:05:00.21 when you'd go up a new notch and they put a new notch in the door frame if you

00:05:05.01 could have like a physical bar of light that showed your progress it would be so

00:05:09.11 great up and down just like the nerves every time you go up you go to use the

00:05:13.11 bathroom you're looking at that [ __ ]

00:05:16.08 bar like oh [ __ ] I need to next game next game's a big one even though we

00:05:19.20 haven't recorded in two weeks Andrew and I've been

00:05:22.15 spending a lot of time together playing a little bit of halo infinite oh that's

00:05:26.15 cool you guys are getting you haven't joined us I haven't been invited no

00:05:31.18 yeah that's that's how that's how that dies

00:05:33.22 uh when you don't invite me I don't join yeah

00:05:36.23 not a big mystery on that one guys yeah but everyone's just on everyone's just

00:05:41.05 playing I'm on playing halo I've played a bunch nobody's ready for you

00:05:47.01 I'm uh I only rank one yeah rank one of what halo halo Taylor ranked

00:05:52.00 do you remember in halo 2 Geoff how they had like symbols is the rank we were

00:05:56.12 talking about that how like it was visually cool but like

00:05:59.14 you'd encounter somebody who was the [ __ ] moon like it would move on from

00:06:03.04 numbers at a certain point it was just nonsensical uh vaguely yeah I remember

00:06:07.13 the halo reach ranking better than any of the other ones I think

00:06:11.22 what was that that was just the military yeah I was just really it was

00:06:15.20 very similar to actual military rank in a fun way for me so I remember like

00:06:20.05 trying to level just because I was it was I don't know it was fun yeah

00:06:24.08 I've I've found I don't know if you've done the ranked games in halo infinite

00:06:28.02 but I've enjoyed it a lot more since becoming ranked and like really focusing

00:06:32.21 in on that I'd recommend you you put time I have only played quick uh quick

00:06:37.04 games like quick play whatever it is you should do ranked it's a lot of fun okay

00:06:41.20 I'll consider it we had a great um comment from a comment leaver recently

00:06:46.12 that I saw because we had last week we were trying to discuss what someone who

00:06:50.02 listens and doesn't leave a comment yeah

00:06:53.15 Geoff was saying like unleavers and stuff there's someone uh on in a comment who

00:06:58.23 whose name is I mean yolo right suggested regulationlessness I'm so glad you

00:07:04.14 brought that up I love that I saw that as well on twitter and I

00:07:08.22 thought that is [ __ ] perfect regulation listeners and comment leavers

00:07:13.01 I I I thank you for bringing that up that I I completely and totally agree

00:07:17.01 regulations there we go yeah I think we're set I think that's

00:07:21.03 I don't even remember leaving this debate and regulationlessness there you go

00:07:25.11 should we just sell both of those as an individual

00:07:28.20 shirt I really want to leave a comment but I don't want to have to buy the

00:07:34.01 shirt because I've already bought the regulation listener it's a real problem

00:07:38.17 maybe we could have like a trade-in program yeah leave your first comment

00:07:44.13 guys I'm [ __ ] out of it I'm sorry I'm trying to say I'm so hungry and I'm so

00:07:49.09 tired we should have done this on a different day probably oh we gotta write

00:07:53.07 our days this might kind of ran out I'll take I you know what I have multiple

00:07:56.18 things I want to apologize for because we haven't recorded since the cosmic

00:08:00.14 crisp review that was a little came in a little hot I was sick at that time

00:08:04.18 didn't realize it I thought uh just bad sleep I want to issue a proper a formal

00:08:10.06 apology to everybody oh I don't think it was a

00:08:14.16 trap I appreciate it as yeah I think I think you guys I think the apple fell

00:08:20.00 against um how do I not turn my apology into an insult

00:08:24.20 um that's a great question I I don't think I don't think there's a great I

00:08:30.07 don't think the room was filled nick seemed very apple qualified I think the

00:08:34.12 rest of the people in in the process of the review seemed a little less apple

00:08:38.19 qualified not their favorite fruit kind of a strange it would be like if I

00:08:42.23 reviewed a banana but not to that extreme what are we

00:08:47.11 qualified at I would find as a as a regulation human I assume

00:08:51.13 I would think I would find your banana review to be just as valid as anyone

00:08:55.13 else's I may not agree with your res with your answer or results your opinion

00:09:00.19 but I think the review is valid I think an echo chamber all regulation humans

00:09:04.20 have should have equal review say that's it's fair but it's just I don't know if

00:09:09.06 you're you're specializing in a specific thing

00:09:12.09 for the majority of people to think that it can only be average at best I feel

00:09:17.10 like puts a ceiling on the extent of that review also just the opinion of

00:09:21.18 that person if that makes sense like it's not a special nobody here I include

00:09:26.14 myself I'm not an apple expert I enjoy apples the main point I wanted to

00:09:31.03 apologize for is I said it was a trap I said you guys it felt like a bit a prank

00:09:36.08 it's you guys didn't fail it was cosmic crisp they failed they failed me I

00:09:40.04 reached out I sent messages no replies I

00:09:42.22 tried my best to get their product it is not your guys's fault that I was not

00:09:48.10 able to secure one it's cosmic crips fault so I apologize for the heat I

00:09:52.11 apologize for the declaration of revenge

00:09:55.07 well then let me apologize Andrew for something real fast uh because since

00:10:00.20 that moment you know I do I'm on the cameo you know I do some cameos

00:10:05.22 uh and since that moment every Canadian cameo I've gotten of which there have

00:10:10.17 been you know it's been a week so they've probably been six or seven uh I

00:10:15.14 have uh potentially uh turned those cameos into uh questions

00:10:19.22 about how the [ __ ] apples work in Canada

00:10:21.23 and why you weren't able to get one and asking them if they could get cosmic

00:10:25.10 crisps and so far nobody's gotten back to me uh I I kind of turned it around on

00:10:31.07 them and made them all put them to work but I did I did maybe get a little uh a

00:10:35.17 little spicy uh talking about your inability to get an apple two other

00:10:39.13 eaters so I apologize for that okay did you eventually get one Andrew no I still

00:10:43.15 haven't got one I'm still looking I'm still looking I'm on them I'm trying I'm

00:10:48.04 putting out feelers I'm going on websites gav imagine being a guy who

00:10:52.19 loves apples consider not an expert but like but

00:10:56.03 certainly an apple an enthusiast who lives in a without a doubt who lives in

00:10:59.20 a country where apples aren't readily available that's got to be a hard life

00:11:03.12 for you I got a lot of apples I just know got the cosmic crisp I'm eating a

00:11:07.14 fuji right now I got a fuji on my desk I

00:11:10.06 got a mandarin orange on my desk is that from your private um favorite apples

00:11:14.13 list that you won't show you know what I'm not saying it's on the list but

00:11:19.03 we're dab little if he's eating it at home that's gotta

00:11:22.00 be top three oh Eric Eric and nick are uh they're taking that as confirmation

00:11:26.14 there is I very few apples I would refuse to just com eat or that I

00:11:31.00 wouldn't buy if I see an apple if I'm walking by I'll grab that apple I'll

00:11:35.08 grab it if it's in a bag I'll take it with me I don't think there's any like

00:11:39.10 value to assuming that because I have it in my house means it is a top apple for

00:11:44.15 me it's a lot of good apples I don't understand why you would buy a non as

00:11:49.12 such an enthusiast with such a refined apple palette I

00:11:53.09 don't know why you would buy a non-top apple like why would you own a non-top

00:11:57.12 apple in your house because if I if I'm just going by

00:12:01.07 the fruit section I maybe don't want to go into the heart of the jungle Geoff I

00:12:05.06 maybe I'm on the perimeter and I'm like you know what fuji isn't bad I'll grab a

00:12:10.04 fuji it's in a bag grab this bag of fuji's so are you so is this a situation

00:12:15.01 where you can only buy apples on end caps uh it's not not like restricted

00:12:20.04 to that but yeah sometimes you know like we've talked about before of not going

00:12:23.13 down the aisle just purchasing on the perimeter on the edges of it sometimes

00:12:27.20 you don't want to go into the heart of the fruit section it's big

00:12:31.18 it's a vast section of you can get lost they got organic products next thing you

00:12:35.22 know you got a whole [ __ ] shopping cart at apples you don't need that I

00:12:40.13 would love to see you get lost in a fruit section

00:12:43.08 I I did when I bought bananas as I said I felt very lost I felt very confused I

00:12:48.12 didn't know if I needed a bag I didn't know if I needed to write stuff down

00:12:53.11 there's a code to certain fruits that I am not aware of

00:12:56.12 boy we got dinged on codes we made that dumb joke about how we had the serial

00:13:00.12 numbers from the stickers oh yeah obviously it's a plu code it says it on

00:13:05.05 it we were just being silly and that one angered a few uh a few people

00:13:09.04 who work at grocery stores for some reason no it's the batch it was the

00:13:12.12 batch number

00:13:16.23 oh Jesus Christ it was fun I enjoyed doing that supplemental review as much

00:13:22.13 as it didn't sound like I did at the time I had a great yeah

00:13:26.10 and that's that's a little something for the audience if you're not aware uh

00:13:30.17 if you somehow missed it we dropped when the apple dropped a couple days after

00:13:34.16 the cosmic crisp dropped we dropped our review of it uh via the usual means you

00:13:39.12 know uh the podcasting uh platforms and whatnot in the YouTube uh but we didn't

00:13:42.08 announce it ahead of time or anything we just threw it out there and it's not a

00:13:45.22 full episode it was just meant to be a review

00:13:48.00 very angry Andrew very interesting I thought it was uh that was a little

00:13:51.18 different and a lot of fun and I hope we do more stuff like that in the future

00:13:55.11 there were I mean the one criticism of the thing it was very different it felt

00:13:59.16 being able to see made a big difference for me I think that's why beyond being

00:14:04.06 sick I think that influenced my anger hearing you guys do a box opening and

00:14:08.11 not being able to see the box or like review the thing was complicated but you

00:14:12.14 were angry after you were watching us no I was angry just in general but it

00:14:16.19 really like for you guys to be like oh it's a box filled with apples and me

00:14:20.10 just looking at a [ __ ] discord screen of nothing well that's how the audience

00:14:24.17 feels yeah but the audience isn't supposed to [ __ ] comment on the box

00:14:28.13 they're not added to the recording oh they comment constantly buddy oh they

00:14:32.10 they do we do have a concrete section but you don't listen to a piece of audio

00:14:37.11 expecting your comment to then impact the show that is currently happening

00:14:40.21 sure sure there's a difference I was supposed to be able to react to a thing

00:14:46.02 but I will say apple's great I become a really big

00:14:50.04 frozen raspberries guy I love a frozen raspberry I think we've talked about it

00:14:55.10 before yeah fantastic yeah I have I've just

00:14:58.13 eaten a photo oh well no I'm not just well I'm kind of doing both I get a

00:15:03.13 glass of water pour it in the well no I get a glass first empty glass

00:15:08.03 gotta fill it with raspberries I feel like half the glass with frozen

00:15:11.19 raspberries then you put the water in it's great it's like ice you snack on it

00:15:16.21 it's delicious I will take a photo that's it that's that's it

00:15:22.00 dad listen it's we like a simple recipe Gavin you just get some frozen

00:15:25.02 raspberries

00:15:27.14 and that to you is better than a room temperature normal raspberry

00:15:33.22 absolutely I think he realized his step is his two-step process was too short so

00:15:39.05 he added another step and that was get a glass that's empty

00:15:44.12 no it starts as empty no this is do you know what happened

00:15:48.10 there I'll give you the [ __ ] honest truth of where my brain went I thought

00:15:52.06 about bathtubs okay and when I get in the tub I sit in an empty tub first then

00:15:56.06 I put the water in I don't put the water in first you gotta put the raspberries

00:16:00.07 in because you need to have enough raspberries if you put the water in

00:16:03.14 first you're limiting the amount of raspberries you can put to the glass

00:16:07.05 well what's stopping you from killing three birds with one stone take a bath

00:16:11.20 throw a bag of frozen raspberries in and snack away yeah

00:16:14.21 no that's gross no think of it like it's almost like romantic like rose

00:16:20.12 petals but you can tell us about it it's you [ __ ] there's no oh I'd vomit

00:16:26.08 everywhere I don't want you keep your muffins on the boxy yeah no I don't I

00:16:31.03 put them in a bowl and I I can't wait for you to visit here at one point

00:16:35.09 you're gonna sit in an empty tub and you're gonna be like you know what

00:16:38.23 that's a [ __ ] convenient table right there that is perfectly level

00:16:43.12 I don't see how putting your headset on the crust zone

00:16:47.18 of a toilet is cleaner than eating I'm raspberries from water

00:16:52.19 no water that you're in is the big like change like you're like water have a

00:16:58.12 shower first then hop in no there's too many steps what am I showering is that

00:17:04.12 step four step five you just throw them in the glass throw them in a glass add

00:17:09.11 water to the glass get a spoon what what are you talking about I don't

00:17:14.01 [ __ ] know it sounds like you're making raspberry you're countering that

00:17:18.07 to my experience of having the raspberries in a glass you're saying

00:17:21.18 that that is a better like that would be the better move and I'm saying there's

00:17:25.11 too many steps it's the biggest glass you could ask for yeah I would like to

00:17:29.20 point out that Eric I think very astutely uh wrote the raspberries are

00:17:33.17 Andrew and the cup is the bathtub yeah it's terrible like nobody wants that

00:17:37.15 like that's awful so well the raspberries probably don't want to be in

00:17:41.01 the cup then if you don't want to be in the bathtub I really do not care about

00:17:44.12 the feelings of the raspberries the raspberries considerations are at the

00:17:48.17 bottom of my list here's what I see I see uh dim turn the lights off light

00:17:52.20 some candles play some soft music maybe one of your favorite football team fight

00:17:57.17 songs then you sprinkle some raspberry whatever you know whatever you're

00:18:01.14 listening to at the moment uh state songs whatever it is and you sprinkle

00:18:05.05 some raspberries dip into the tub and just relax and then occasionally when the

00:18:10.17 mood strikes just reach your little hand out pluck a raspberry out of the water

00:18:15.12 yum andrew's taking himself on a date I don't know I don't like it I'm not a

00:18:21.03 fan of that that seems impressive see I'm fascinated by the line you draw

00:18:26.13 between what's acceptable of what is gross because I feel like for me should

00:18:30.00 I straight line between all the normal gross [ __ ] and all the you know usual

00:18:35.14 stuff yours is a bit of a wiggly one it sort of goes around

00:18:38.16 into gross as acceptable and back out and this is apparently

00:18:42.15 there are certain things that enter into just the purely gross category that

00:18:47.01 you'd never do and then there are things where

00:18:50.04 at the time like it's easy for me to say now I would not do that thing

00:18:54.06 I lost him I lost him yeah he's he's gone I just heard dang

00:18:58.10 and then he went in and drifted away yeah he's yeah he's he went

00:19:03.08 down the drain of the bathtub oh Eric Geoff have you shot today's today's

00:19:08.19 today's the day buddy uh now's the time

00:19:08.19 to go [ __ ] no I'm okay at the moment are

00:19:11.14 you sure you don't want to like push one out no there's no push it out oh my god

00:19:16.02 it's weird just trying to hold it in there's no pushing it's just on the day

00:19:21.11 I [ __ ] my pants six times it was just water

00:19:23.20 I mean it is literally if I recorded it you wouldn't be able to tell the

00:19:27.10 difference from me peeing and [ __ ]

00:19:29.05 um wait did I did I vanish yeah you've been gone for a while oh I would I did a

00:19:34.06 whole [ __ ] I did a whole thing oh you should have done it for us we would have

00:19:38.10 loved it thought I thought everyone was listening I was oh where did I leave off

00:19:43.02 I said Geoff is a shell of a man and then there was no response and I realized

00:19:46.19 that I don't even think I heard that part yeah no we didn't hear but we you've

00:19:52.15 been gone for about 45 seconds probably I did a whole [ __ ] monologue about

00:19:56.12 this thing and it was silent and I was like I don't know if this is going

00:19:59.15 really well or if you guys are just listening I don't know how to feel about

00:20:03.03 this and then there was silence after I I kind of threw a shot at Geoff no

00:20:08.08 responses like ah something is clearly broken and I came back to

00:20:12.12 [ __ ] Geoff talking about [ __ ]

00:20:14.03 Which funny enough is where I was leading anyway oh and so it synced up I

00:20:18.04 was very confused well do you want to go

00:20:20.15 back and insult me where we where we can all hear it I was just saying that I

00:20:23.22 think the gross line it can change based off of where you're where you're at if

00:20:27.22 you're exhausted you're having a bad day maybe what would seem gross in an ideal

00:20:32.05 scenario is acceptable at that time I see that sort of

00:20:36.08 are you saying that you think that like potentially

00:20:40.04 my view of the grossness of your raspberry romance bath is being uh

00:20:45.05 affected by this my my current situation like if I was that if I was like a

00:20:49.21 healthy happy Geoff I might I might find it a little grosser exactly that's what

00:20:54.06 I was saying where Geoff is like you're not you're not a hundred percent right

00:20:59.12 now I'm not maybe there's a thing what percent are you uh I'm gonna uh so

00:21:04.10 I came in thinking I was at like 85

00:21:07.16 I felt pretty good about it and uh and then

00:21:10.13 then y'all got y'all got me immediately and I realized I wasn't at 80 I was at

00:21:16.23 more like 40.

00:21:18.14 [Laughter]

00:25:24.14 and you know when you have those I don't

00:25:26.10 know I feel like this is relatable where you're in bed you're comfy but you kind

00:25:29.15 of have a thought of like oh what if I go down and do this instead what if I

00:25:34.00 get a snack what if I get a drink of something yeah but I'm so cozy and you

00:25:38.05 have that like real struggle and I had I was like you know what it's [ __ ]

00:25:41.11 we're getting into the winter season my favorite time of year yeah you're

00:25:46.04 battling the cozy wool some hot chocolate right now would be [ __ ]

00:25:50.19 delicious what a like just a nice little cup of hot cocoa oh man what a time

00:25:56.01 I was laying there I fought I had this fight in my head for 25 minutes do I get

00:26:00.09 up I'm so comfy do I get hot chocolate I decide I'm gonna go get some hot

00:26:04.12 chocolate so I go down I get the milk going it's nice and warm

00:26:08.21 I'm doing it all fancy I got the marshmallows out are you doing it in a pan

00:26:13.16 I'm doing it I'm doing it in a pot I'm doing it I'm like taking my time I'm

00:26:19.01 enjoying the experience I got my cabbage in the cupboard I got my the kettle is

00:26:23.23 there's so many people that want to fight me that that is a kettle it's the

00:26:27.20 most ridiculous having to send product links but anyway

00:26:30.18 the thing is being made it's delicious I

00:26:34.04 got my tablet and one hand whipped cream marshmallow it's hot it's oh it's

00:26:39.07 fantastic I turn around I take four steps I drop my tablet hit

00:26:44.04 my forearm shift my forearm spill hot chocolate everywhere largely on myself

00:26:49.18 burn my shoulder just scorch my shoulder

00:26:52.11 with hot milk I got whipped cream on the ceiling I got marshmallows on a pantry

00:26:58.01 door I think there's so much velocity it flew everywhere I don't know Gavin how

00:27:02.21 it got so much velocity but it went [ __ ] everywhere because as I've just

00:27:08.00 learned you've got high ceilings I do I do have high ceiling it [ __ ]

00:27:14.00 flew it flew everywhere I burnt myself the speaker on my tablet no longer works

00:27:17.20 I broke that in the hot chocolate I had to clean everything up I

00:27:22.02 immediately my shirt's still in the kitchen it's just there I took the shirt

00:27:26.00 off it was covered in hot chocolate miserable it was miserable it was one of

00:27:29.23 the worst hot chocolate experiences I've

00:27:31.20 ever had I cleaned everything up I had a quarter of a cup left I shot some

00:27:36.02 whipped cream in there and I just sat downstairs and watched Seinfeld sad

00:27:40.09 eating the remains of my hot chocolate it was terrible

00:27:44.12 miserable making a night after all that he didn't just make a new one no I was

00:27:49.17 broken I was a broken man Gavin I was a burnt shoulder I was picking

00:27:53.15 marshmallows up off the floor having to put stuff in the garbage that

00:27:57.18 you know is delicious is always crushing I'm just sitting in the dark watching

00:28:03.03 Seinfeld at 1am miserable this is after yeah this is like maybe 40

00:28:08.04 minutes after my whole evening was ruined I should have just stayed in bed

00:28:13.12 that's all I kept thinking about I should have just stayed in bed I

00:28:17.20 I got no whipped cream on any ceiling [ __ ] uh it's the worst it's terrible

00:28:23.08 it was ah I've had a bad run well I'm sorry I'm so sorry that happened to you

00:28:27.14 man I feel like burning the shoulder only is a rare one like I could maybe it

00:28:31.09 would get up to the shoulder if you like burn your whole your whole arm it only

00:28:35.07 burnt a corner of my shoulder and I luckily avoided the cat that is

00:28:39.22 like the biggest thing that I don't know how the cat didn't get hit by any of it

00:28:45.20 voided them sam sam yeah do you know that I know that you're

00:28:50.08 aware of this cat 20 years old it's yes she is it's it's been I don't

00:28:54.03 know it was a rough night in that regard I'm just spilling [ __ ] all over the

00:28:58.08 place I I've become a maple syrup guy it's a big addition in my life

00:29:03.03 really gotten into maple syrup recently I was making some pancakes took him

00:29:06.13 upstairs put I was carrying a lot of stuff I think my issue is I'm carrying

00:29:09.20 too many things at once well yeah you've always got a tablet in your hands.

00:29:15.03 I had like six different things in my hands and I'm gonna sit at my desk to

00:29:20.09 eat my pancakes with a lot of maple syrup and I put the plate on the bed for

00:29:25.11 a minute and then I think oh [ __ ]

00:29:27.20 there's so much maple syrup on that and I quickly grabbed it luckily didn't come

00:29:31.07 off I was like whoa that could have been really bad so I continue with the rest

00:29:36.13 of my night crawling the bed ready to sleep pull up the first blanket it's

00:29:41.01 drenched in maple syrup just coated in it and I was like oh [ __ ] it's wanting

00:29:46.18 like I just want to go to bed [ __ ] see that's that's where our lines

00:29:51.17 between acceptable and gross differ because I don't want to put food in my

00:29:55.16 bed I don't want food anywhere no it was just there for a moment I put the plate

00:30:00.02 down for a second because I had so many things in my hand to adjust to put other

00:30:04.13 stuff on the desk then I immediately grabbed the food from the bed it was

00:30:08.07 just at an angle the plate was at an angle and all the maple syrup poured off

00:30:12.17 the pancakes onto the blanket so you were sticky it was

00:30:16.13 all sticky both blankets were I threw that off I was like well at least I have

00:30:19.20 another oh no this one's also [ __ ]

00:30:22.12 covered in maple syrup that's just coated in it my whole arm

00:30:25.11 everything terrible that's I made how did it get on the other blanket

00:30:29.17 it's so viscous I wouldn't imagine it would go through quickly I think it just

00:30:34.03 hit double coverage I think it hit both of them at the same time and I didn't

00:30:37.09 see it there was a lot of maple syrup on my plate and I think it just slid off

00:30:41.17 and coated two different blankets and I could never get maple syrup right

00:30:46.08 I feel like I'm putting too much on and then I get to eat the pancakes and

00:30:49.08 suddenly it's all absorbed and I'm like where the hell did all the maple syrup

00:30:53.03 go I can't even taste it and I put more it's it's really hot it's a surprisingly

00:30:56.21 difficult condiment to get right I feel like really I put zero thought into you

00:31:02.02 just drown it well I'm not necessarily drowning it but

00:31:05.06 I've never been like oh that's too much or too little it's like that's just I

00:31:08.10 have maple syrup that's interesting I've never even

00:31:11.06 considered the possibility of like loading too much on it are you working

00:31:15.03 on your pancake mix that you ordered is that where you're getting

00:31:18.14 yeah I'm still no I'm still going through my 70 pounds I don't think I

00:31:24.00 finished a 10 pound bag of it I'm still working for

00:31:28.00 I totally forgot about that 70 pounds isn't it close to expiring I think it

00:31:31.16 expires in 2023 I think I got time I think I'm good but yeah I've been I've

00:31:36.00 been working away I'm almost done my first 10 pound bag

00:31:40.02 I'll gladly make you pancakes if you guys ever come over

00:31:43.18 I'm so excited to come over yeah you can eat them in the tub and you'll see

00:31:48.21 let's uh let's be sure to make it when we do that an official

00:31:53.14 face event so I get the invite too oh you're always invited Geoff am I I was

00:31:57.11 invited to halo for the last week I I had an interesting thought while I was

00:32:00.10 listening to all these stories and I was thinking I was thinking about a fun bit

00:32:03.22 we could do uh would be I could put out like a

00:32:07.09 request and try to find some new or real

00:32:09.17 friends uh who actually like me and want to spend time with me I texted you guys

00:32:15.20 at 10 o'clock this morning you Eric and uh and uh Gavin

00:32:19.16 once again not nobody responded to me becoming very clear it wasn't a question

00:32:25.09 conversation starter do you ever text me okay this is you send a text saying

00:32:31.18 today is gonna be interesting on the day

00:32:34.19 we record the podcast oh well I think it is hell yeah can't wait yeah

00:32:39.21 that was my reaction too I thought that that was like a oh exciting save it for

00:32:45.07 the show type thing and you thought hell yeah

00:32:47.08 [ __ ] and he doesn't deserve a reply I was trying to start a conversation with

00:32:51.09 you guys yeah my point being it's very very and

00:32:54.07 it's okay it's okay because it's a day job we all got to make our paychecks I

00:32:58.02 get it we do we have we have great on-screen chemistry but I think a fun

00:33:00.17 bit I didn't have this in my notes because I just came up with this right

00:33:03.22 now but I think a fun cool thing we could do is maybe I could like put out a

00:33:07.07 call to the comment leavers and the regulation listeners that like hey I

00:33:10.19 might want to play halo with friends I might want to text with people back and

00:33:13.22 forth and have them respond to me within three or four days like the last time I

00:33:17.14 brought it up uh maybe there's some people out there who may not think maybe

00:33:19.09 think that there's some value in old Geoff as a friend and maybe just want to

00:33:22.04 have a conversation with me if you're out there let me know on twitter or

00:33:25.14 something I'm currently in the marketplace

00:33:28.05 having a conversation I'm so lonely and I don't have any friends to talk to so

00:33:33.01 audience hit me up daily what do you mean I don't feel like

00:33:37.20 is going to be interesting g is what you texted the group text

00:33:43.03 I was I read that Geoff with excitement thinking oh I don't want to ask about it

00:33:48.20 in the text because I don't want to ruin what will happen on the show there's a

00:33:52.21 huge risk with responding to the group chat we could easily blow all of our

00:33:57.11 reactions to something good it's it's a massive risk and I can't believe you're

00:34:00.22 acting like it isn't let's it's a huge race

00:34:03.11 the last time we'll go back through our text a little bit uh because Gavin and I

00:34:08.12 talk daily uh on Saturday I texted Gavin and I said uh

00:34:12.21 hey text me back eventually you did uh and then I we talked about some stuff

00:34:18.21 eventually then uh then Sunday November 7th which was this is the uh I sent you

00:34:25.14 a video and I said if you see this and you said yeah

00:34:29.03 eventually I text you back you text me at 924 am I replied at 1006. That's not

00:34:35.11 eventually no that's fine that's pretty uh then the next time we talked on our

00:34:40.07 daily talk was Sunday November 7th I sent you a video and I said have you

00:34:43.06 seen this and then you said yeah and then I sent you a video on Sunday or I

00:34:47.12 sent you a text on the Sunday to ask how you were feeling and then you responded

00:34:52.05 but at no point in any of the oh and then I said uh again I sent you another

00:34:56.15 text to see how you were feeling uh and at no point in any of these

00:35:00.12 conversations did you reach out to me first this is only me reaching out

00:35:04.12 desperate for a friend getting one or two word answers and then moving on with

00:35:08.08 my life and then trying to get a week later I

00:35:11.13 I I'm can't refuse that that we're talking about text messages this is awful

00:35:16.00 we went on the podcast on Monday well I was that was another day we didn't need

00:35:20.23 to text I've been seeing so much of you yeah okay well great

00:35:25.22 happy to do more as always uh I feel like if you if you're if

00:35:30.15 you're teeing up some good face stuff the best thing to do is just

00:35:34.07 to wait to hear it I think that was the misunderstanding in that text Geoff I

00:35:37.12 think clearly it was about the colonoscopy that it was I was trying I

00:35:40.21 was trying to talk to you guys about my thing and then just nobody was nobody

00:35:44.06 seemed interested in responding to me so I thought oh well I'm not going to

00:35:47.20 burden them with my problems because they can't even be bothered to respond

00:35:51.16 to me I was also at work I was in the middle of a let's play I'm not gonna you

00:35:55.18 know I'm about to come out I arrived home

00:35:58.01 late like five minutes after we started because I didn't have any time I haven't

00:36:01.11 even eaten yet I don't there's all this all these demands it's not a demand it

00:36:06.02 was like five hours ago I said four hours ago I sent that text how does it work

00:36:10.09 I was in the video that you didn't go to we could to be just completely honest

00:36:15.10 that could have we could have recorded 10 hours from now I still wouldn't have

00:36:18.13 responded because I thought it was show related I thought it was like oh

00:36:22.20 exciting thing for the show all right that's fine it doesn't have to

00:36:26.12 be well I I I rescind everything I've said then uh you guys are the best I

00:36:30.00 look forward to playing halo with you constantly it sounds like we do it all

00:36:33.00 the time I'd look you know what I you know you

00:36:35.14 know what I look forward to somebody texting me first one day I texted you

00:36:39.15 yes you texted me first yesterday and then started a conversation with me and

00:36:44.07 then disappeared and then when I said hey what's up man you gonna tell me that

00:36:47.12 thing you said oh never mind I had the conversation with Gavin I don't want to

00:36:52.08 have it with you again we needed to type so this was massive text [ __ ] read it

00:36:56.16 no please do because this is a whole this you have no idea how how like bad I

00:37:01.14 felt I felt bad on so many levels and this has happened before but it's the

00:37:05.11 first time I've been trapped you texted me out of the blue uh which I appreciate

00:37:09.20 it it was the and you said I have an idea and I said

00:37:13.09 go on and then uh I didn't hear from you for I don't know three minutes and then

00:37:16.21 you responded to me and you said I hate myself and then you said I told it all

00:37:20.16 to Gavin and I said okay should I go and I was like okay so should I ask Gavin

00:37:24.21 for the information then and you go no I

00:37:26.16 just I'm not going to tell you just save it for this show yeah we'll do it I'm

00:37:30.01 like okay we could have even when you're texting me even when you're trying to

00:37:33.20 have a conversation with me you're not you're doing it with someone else you're

00:37:37.14 dealing with Gavin let's just cut me out of the out of the out of the

00:37:41.01 conversation completely absolutely not let's just I want you to hear my

00:37:45.05 position on this my perspective I texted you that thing and I was so

00:37:48.22 excited to talk to you about it Geoff like genuinely I was like I can't wait

00:37:52.18 to talk to Geoff here's opinion I value it he's so funny he's a creative guy I

00:37:58.21 can't wait this is gonna be so wonderful I text you you reply

00:38:02.23 I had gotten a text from Gavin earlier in the day you're both g's on my phone

00:38:07.22 you both have the same icon because of that like the default g Google thing I

00:38:14.06 accidentally then clicked Gavin and I sent like seven or eight texts

00:38:19.11 explaining and outlining this idea with a link and then I realized oh [ __ ]

00:38:24.21 this is I sent all these to Gavin too hard to copy and paste back to me well

00:38:29.10 because I thought it'd be funnier on the show to have Gavin then explain to you

00:38:33.16 my idea um but Gavin what could you explain to me andrew's idea I've been on

00:38:38.14 I've been waiting for days to hear it from what I've seen um you watch 10

00:38:43.13 hours of Betty white and you get paid a grand or something so the idea was

00:38:50.08 we've talked about before on the show budget port-a-potty budget dumb budget

00:38:55.15 we need a budget I came across this absurd

00:38:59.07 this absurd contest if you want to call it that it's like Betty white is in no

00:39:04.13 way affiliated with it or endorsed by it but it's this insurance company that is

00:39:09.18 like hey if you can prove you're the biggest Betty white fan

00:39:14.12 we will give you a thousand dollars at a

00:39:17.08 dvd player and some DVDs and you have to document yourself watching 10 hours of

00:39:22.15 Betty white and that's the contest you're being the

00:39:26.13 contest is them trying to find the biggest Betty white fan to then have

00:39:30.14 social media like document their experience of watching this content I

00:39:35.22 don't think anyone's gonna [ __ ] enter that thing and I feel like we could just

00:39:40.00 take over random contests and win them and that is how we could fund this show

00:39:44.12 we just need to win these things I also thought it'd be really funny if on our

00:39:48.06 YouTube channel just a random video out of nowhere comes out of one of us

00:39:52.10 talking about how much they love Betty white and why she's so great

00:39:56.13 and then so like there's a week where the audience will be like what is why is

00:40:00.20 Geoff or whatever talking about Betty white with like no context so all we

00:40:05.11 have to do is make that before this comes out all we would have to do is

00:40:08.17 before it the contest ends on the 22nd for submission so the audience in no way

00:40:13.19 can impact this in any way they can't apply they won't hear after the fact

00:40:18.19 and I don't think anyone will apply so I

00:40:21.12 think if we apply and include a video of

00:40:23.16 the application I think we might be able

00:40:26.08 to win the Betty white dream job contest I I

00:40:28.18 sounds awesome to me I like the idea of entering random contests uh that nobody

00:40:33.06 else enters and wins I know we we know somebody uh associated with rich teeth

00:40:36.21 who used to do that and had a lot of success with it I remember I listened to

00:40:41.00 a uh like a game podcast then they talked about how running like a gaming

00:40:44.15 website in the mid 2000s they used to have these huge contests where it was

00:40:50.04 like if you could submit in the greatest like psp guide or whatever for this

00:40:54.00 thing you will win a car through this promo that they're doing and nobody had

00:40:58.08 the ability to capture footage at that point or like just the the barriers the

00:41:02.08 entry were so hard they'd have like four people enter for a new car and it was

00:41:06.09 just like a constant thing where it's like it was such a small thing I think

00:41:10.15 if we target these weird bizarre contests we could just rack up the wins

00:41:15.20 confused at this contest like everyone applies

00:41:19.01 and if you're like and then they select only one person

00:41:23.20 to watch 10 hours from like various pre-provided DVDs

00:41:27.20 and then you get a grand so they all they get out of this

00:41:30.14 is one person doing like a bit of social media about Betty white yeah but what I

00:41:35.05 really love is when you read the details

00:41:37.00 of the contest there's a very clear line that Betty white has no affiliation or

00:41:41.14 support of this it did she in no way endorses this in any way I don't know

00:41:45.08 how they came to the decision of doing this Betty white thing but I don't think

00:41:49.05 anyone will enter and I think we could take it over and even if we don't get

00:41:53.16 selected I think we could hijack the Betty white thing if they've got like a

00:41:57.02 hashtag or whatever we could just take over

00:41:59.15 the hashtag I feel like I could easily watch 10 hours of golden girls that's

00:42:03.04 some good [ __ ] is that your favorite Betty white content that's the only bet

00:42:06.18 white I've seen what's better than golden girls this is what the best shows

00:42:10.02 of all time like placid great that's a that's a good movie but

00:42:13.20 what are you gonna watch lake placid six times I could easily watch like placid

00:42:17.23 six times she's feeding the [ __ I the thing well don't do don't spoil the

00:42:22.00 [ __ ] movie for people who haven't seen it oh I'm sorry you haven't had

00:42:25.12 time no yeah [ __ ] placid lake placid is is a very good movie it's also got uh

00:42:30.21 what's-his-face in it um Oliver is all over flat Oliver in that yeah yeah he's

00:42:35.22 great in it yeah I don't know if it's an

00:42:38.00 intentional it must be they get like the greatest gag in that movie is they keep

00:42:41.20 so one of the characters keeps falling into traps set for the crocodile or

00:42:47.07 whatever alligator what is it is it crocodile or alligator

00:42:50.16 I never know I always confuse this that is probably an alligator because I think

00:42:54.05 it's fresh water yeah because it's like plastic people are always trying to

00:42:57.08 figure out if it's an alligator or a crocodile in what situation does it ever

00:43:01.18 matter that's a great point too gav gals are bigger than alligators that's the

00:43:05.13 only difference I mean they'll both rip your arm off yeah they I think they yeah

00:43:11.01 I feel like jeopardy would matter trivia shows

00:43:14.04 side of that I guess if may am balak is asking you it matters [Laughter]

00:43:19.01 could we can we sign up for this can we just

00:43:22.06 enter the battle dude who's stopping us I can't well I can't do it because it

00:43:27.12 has to be a u.s I'm blocked we'll talk to a producer

00:43:31.07 Eric he'll do it Eric are you going to sign up for us you're going to be our

00:43:35.11 Betty white ambassador uh no nick can do it he's he's not busy oh there you go

00:43:41.01 yeah do you think you're less you're more busy than nick uh yeah

00:43:45.08 immediately meets [Laughter]

00:43:48.10 nick says are you sure wait a second everyone was just talking about the joy

00:43:53.09 of being able to spend 10 hours watching Betty white and then when it comes time

00:43:58.14 to sign up everyone's subtly busy I watch the Betty white I just don't

00:44:02.13 think I can pull off a good video explaining why I love Betty white okay I

00:44:07.05 will I'll fill out the form on your behalf Geoff is that okay

00:44:11.22 so I don't understand like your your your grand vision here is for me to

00:44:16.21 enter a contest for you to win for us to win no the show we've seen on the

00:44:27.07 and then you spend the money that we win that you don't we're no no we all it's

00:44:33.03 when it comes to community pool this is a view it this way we're winning a port a

00:44:37.00 potty essentially is the price of this great because we don't ever get given

00:44:41.07 money for anything and all of the sales money for the billion ad reads on these

00:44:45.20 videos and uh um and audio files don't come to us either they all go in the

00:44:50.17 pocket of sales this could be um it's all gonna be contest winning budget this

00:44:55.08 is interesting I this is that's a really good way to look at it gav yeah what

00:45:00.06 could we do with a thousand dollars after taxes exactly

00:45:04.12 what could we do with seven hundred dollars it's prize winning so it's probably

00:45:09.20 taxed to the moon what can we do with 630 dollars [Laughter]

00:45:15.12 this is just the start okay we start cleaning up we started no I'm thinking

00:45:20.04 like we could buy a surfboard what could I bought a surfboard once for 600 bucks

00:45:23.12 really they probably cost about that we could buy a surfboard I'm I'm not still

00:45:27.04 I'm not trying to be a [ __ ] here I'm being serious I'm trying to think of

00:45:30.19 what we could spend 600700 on there's a lot you could repair your bike uh

00:45:35.01 I don't talk about it oh no I don't I don't want to open up that

00:45:38.12 whole camera I got a bike I got bike problems man jet ski rental that'll

00:45:42.13 that'll that'll that's three 600 bucks would be two jet skis for three hours

00:45:47.19 right we could do that that'd be pretty good

00:45:51.02 that'd be pretty good or three jet skis for two hours that might be better oh

00:45:54.12 yeah then Andrew could have his own absolutely oh

00:45:58.00 I like this one I assume you don't want to

00:46:01.03 this could fund the joust that's what I'm saying that's a great idea

00:46:06.12 Betty white's joust fund [Music]

00:46:08.20 we have to call it the regulation Betty white joust something along those lines

00:46:14.21 if we can I will I will recant now and say if I don't like the idea of the

00:46:20.14 joust but if the Betty white contest does fund it then I'm on board and will

00:46:26.04 do whatever it takes in order to win this money I just love the idea of this

00:46:30.09 company sending the cheque

00:46:33.07 to the Betty white house fund at face the subsidiary of uniform [Music]

00:46:42.08 well technically it's a subsidiary of fluke face which is an arm oh sorry

00:46:47.09 uniform uniform so let me combine the power of one let's have a form uniform

00:46:52.08 so now we just need uh we need a video Geoff explaining why Betty white is so

00:46:55.19 great we can we can do that but we need to watch the 10 hours of content first I

00:46:59.22 was going to say no no no no no no yeah but don't you

00:47:03.12 don't you need to watch something to remind yourself of how great Betty

00:47:07.17 white is do you think you're just going to shoot you think you're just gonna

00:47:11.04 spit hot Betty white takes from the hip without

00:47:14.06 like refamiliarizing herself yourself with any of her content you're gonna

00:47:17.15 have to dip your toe into Betty white a little bit before you make the video

00:47:22.08 I'm not sure about that I don't know I mean it's only to watch your favorite

00:47:27.22 scene of lake placid so you can quote a moment you don't want to sound like your

00:47:33.07 idea alright your idea is very sound and

00:47:36.00 very good and even though I am operating at about a four I think I'm down to

00:47:40.21 about 36 percent right now uh and just loopy as [ __ ] even even at this

00:47:45.22 diminished capacity I can see the potential I think it's a fantastic idea

00:47:50.04 but I think if you want to like I I do think we should enter this I do think we

00:47:54.09 should try to win I do think there won't be a ton of people I also don't think

00:47:58.21 it'll be a walk through the park I do think other people will and we'll have

00:48:02.12 to put some level of effort in and I think that we're gonna have to come

00:48:06.06 across as actual Betty white fans or I agree with all that okay

00:48:10.13 I mean could we all dress up as the golden girls that's an idea see that's

00:48:14.12 thinking outside the box that does I don't know how there's no

00:48:17.23 way I could submit that I want to be Sophia what if we dress up instead well

00:48:22.10 you know we can dress up as our favorite golden girls but then it's about more

00:48:25.20 than Betty what if we all dress up as our favorite Betty white

00:48:29.20 from her career like you get like Gavin you could be rose nylon right okay and

00:48:34.04 and Andrew you could be uh the crocodile or the alligator or Betty white from

00:48:39.05 lake placid and I'll pick up Betty white from some other like uh what is it it's

00:48:44.00 uh it's all uh it's what is that show she had it's like hot and

00:48:48.15 oh hot in Cleveland hot is that england never seen it but I'll familiarize

00:48:52.05 myself with hot in Cleveland and I'll be that Betty white character I love this

00:48:56.02 this is I'm glad that there's support I wish that I would have texted the right

00:48:59.16 person the entire way through yesterday maybe I'll hold up a collection of

00:49:05.03 things that Betty white is older than such as the ballpoint pen that's I don't

00:49:10.06 wh I don't understand why what what else came out no that's

00:49:13.09 that's a great thing no here's your take on this guy

00:49:17.09 here's your thing right now Betty white street music Betty white is such an

00:49:22.22 institutional like such a a national uh uh what's the word I'm looking for here

00:49:29.07 uh treasure a national treasure she should be when she it dies there should

00:49:35.03 be uh uh she she should be interned in the Smithsonian her career has she is

00:49:40.21 still at the top of her game at 90 x years old right and she her career has

00:49:45.18 spanned so much time she has been a famous she's been entertaining

00:49:50.10 millions of audience members since before the electric can opener since

00:49:55.20 before the ballpoint pen these are great ways to show not only the longevity of

00:49:59.19 her brilliant career but our knowledge of it this is what's going to win us the

00:50:05.05 contest [ __ ] like that Gavin that's smart dude number one sliced bread

00:50:10.05 she's older than sliced bread that means sliced bread is the best thing since

00:50:14.19 Betty white sliced bread is the best thing since Betty white that's a t-shirt.

00:50:20.23 [Laughter]

00:50:22.04 Other people must have made the observation already

00:50:25.18 why are we not mentioning the high five and we're just talking about things that

00:50:29.21 she's older than she's way older than that Geoff's older than the high five

00:50:33.05 according to your [ __ ] yeah that's not my [ __ ] it's just a historic

00:50:37.06 fact knowing about history coming at dusty baker he didn't know what to do

00:50:41.20 Gavin can you imagine the pressure of seeing a hand and not knowing what to do

00:50:46.06 with it your product didn't exist yet

00:50:52.08 oh speaking of uh things that Betty white is older than

00:50:56.04 if we ever s this is the problem with like not all the content that I have we

00:51:01.08 haven't touched anything on my list uh nor do I think we will but a lot of it

00:51:05.12 isn't evergreen and one of those things is Andrew your [ __ ] nugget challenge

00:51:10.13 I pulled some stats I don't know if they're relevant anymore but I put some

00:51:15.20 stats of like all time oh my god you okay I how do I undo I just wanted

00:51:23.05 all of my notes [Laughter]

00:51:29.11 what in the [ __ ] just are you on your phone

00:51:32.21 okay I got it back okay that was weird I just deleted face by accident I did

00:51:39.09 yeah I wanted to list uh well like I said guys diminished capacity and and

00:51:44.14 I'll let's be honest you've known me for a long time my capacity hasn't been

00:51:48.15 minished like at my best I'm never very minish uh

00:51:52.10 so we want to look at best performances of all time now obviously wilt

00:51:57.01 chamberlain has the highest scoring game

00:51:59.21 of all time he scored 100 points in 1961

00:52:02.21 versus the Knicks uh the second highest points total by nba players Kobe Bryant

00:52:08.12 with 81. Then we have some other people uh like I've never heard of David

00:52:13.20 Thompson um he was a Denver he was a Denver nugget though and he scored 73

00:52:18.07 points although I'm not sure if that's correct because

00:52:22.00 that's different on my other list uh anyway uh so but that puts you in the

00:52:28.00 same category as Michael Jordan his high career high 69

00:52:32.02 pistol Pete maravich 68 uh Devin booker had that terrible game with 70 against

00:52:35.23 the celtics nobody wants to remember that uh anyway and then a bunch of wilt

00:52:39.12 chamberlain doing it over and over and over and over again but you scored what

00:52:44.13 62 was where you were gav no I was I think I was like 67 no you

00:52:48.17 were in the 60s you were in the 60s I was in the 60s I was 62 or 67. Okay uh

00:52:54.13 kind of blocked that whole anyway remember you have scored more points in

00:52:59.09 your one nba game than Stephen curry whose career high is only

00:53:04.08 62. Carmelo Anthony career high is only 62. The great Tracy mcgrady only 62.

00:53:10.02 Damian lillard has only scored 61 points in his career James harden has only

00:53:15.18 scored 61 points in his career did it twice though LeBron James highest

00:53:22.08 scoring game of his nba career 61 points those are all people you bested in your

00:53:28.19 first and only nba game that is so Eric is right that is rarefied air

00:53:34.05 is that I am more qualified than LeBron James to make another space jam movie if

00:53:39.16 they make a space jam 3

00:53:41.12 my credentials are more deserving than whatever he's done

00:53:44.09 they're definitely up there I mean that's a

00:53:47.09 to say that's an impressive list is is an understatement not only that I I know

00:53:52.01 this might be where I saw it according to according to the internet the highest

00:53:56.02 scoring regular season game by a Denver nugget was kiki vanderway he scored 51

00:54:01.13 points so you've kicked the [ __ ] out of you you

00:54:05.08 trout like the nuggets in the history of their franchise have nobody that they

00:54:10.06 can put up against you Eric just said andrew's a hell of an athlete

00:54:13.20 you guys haven't even seen me do the song machine yet that's really going to

00:54:16.20 blow some minds those guys drop some heads I don't know if you're a hell of

00:54:20.15 an athlete but you're a hell of an eat pleat I'm telling you

00:54:24.15 the sewing machine is a word I hope I just made up eat fleet athlete eat fleet

00:54:29.12 but I don't I feel like I'm a terrible athlete

00:54:32.01 why why do you think you're a terrible athlete because going against any of the

00:54:35.17 people that are athletes you know like a

00:54:39.03 joey chestnut a kobayashi whatever I got no chance but I feel like going against

00:54:42.17 athletes and the athletic world my numbers are pretty good

00:54:46.18 I feel like I have to stay in the athlete territory the moment I go in the

00:54:51.12 athlete I'm at the bottom of the pile dude Devin booker to my knowledge Devon

00:54:55.12 booker is the only player playing in the nba right now who has outscored you

00:55:00.03 that's [ __ ] how many did he get how many did he he got 70 against the

00:55:04.21 celtics like three I can [ __ ] I can I'll [ __ ] destroy Devin booker I'll

00:55:08.20 take him out but can you though because you stopped shy of that yeah but there's

00:55:14.06 a difference what mentally when you're trying to eat 120 nuggets as opposed to

00:55:19.22 71 that's a big gap that's a big difference I could definitely use 71.

00:55:23.09 I can make that work exactly and we're not doing this for a while this is gonna

00:55:27.16 be months from now I need to get back into nugget shape nugget form nugget

00:55:31.11 mentality I need to work my way back it takes a lot to do these

00:55:35.12 and what what kind of things will you be doing to prepare

00:55:38.12 absolutely nothing it's just more of a time and forgetting how bad like a reset

00:55:42.19 yeah just like once enough time passes where I fully forget everything and then

00:55:47.14 there will be an evening where I'm like [ __ ] Devin booker's going down I'm

00:55:51.06 going to wake up at 400 a.m one day and just say Devon booker's time is over I

00:55:57.05 am dethroning David yeah you gotta you gotta wait for the nugget confidence to

00:56:00.21 hit you I understand that yeah now's the time should I get up and do nuggets

00:56:05.22 oh man nuggets all over myself do you know uh

00:56:09.12 uh eric's letting us given us the wrap up sign and we got to because we got to

00:56:13.05 record another one I'll be honestly I didn't know if I was going to make it to

00:56:16.15 the next one but I I the last like five minutes I've started to feel a little

00:56:20.15 bit better uh so maybe I can uh I do want to let you guys know on something

00:56:23.16 that we missed this week that I think could have been spectacular uh okay but

00:56:28.02 uh Eric shot it down tomorrow as we as we know I'm getting my colonoscopy to

00:56:32.13 get my colonoscopy uh if you've never gotten one it's not a fun process you

00:56:36.06 can't eat for a bunch of days you get on a liquid diet you have to drink a bunch

00:56:39.19 of weird [ __ ] that tastes gross that makes you [ __ ] and puke constantly I

00:56:45.09 have to drink like after we're done I have to go drink 46 ounces of liquid

00:56:50.10 in like an hour so they mean no resistance on the way up

00:56:53.09 well you have to rest your colon so you can't have any food go through

00:56:57.13 uh that could agitate it or fill it up in my in my case I you know I have

00:57:01.18 diverticulosis so I have those little pockets all over so you gotta flush out

00:57:05.08 your system uh like kind of shock it out

00:57:07.21 and then uh and then you have to keep it clean and clear because even like

00:57:12.09 colored food anything with a dye like gate like red gatorade can look like

00:57:16.12 blood to a camera and so it's just it's not a fun process and then they make you

00:57:20.11 take a bunch of special liquids that extra clear you out right like like

00:57:25.05 you've never taken a laxative like you've taken when you go for a

00:57:28.07 colonoscopy uh anyway it's like nick says awful like he's I'm

00:57:32.05 assuming nick has had a colonoscopy before I have as well this is my second

00:57:35.17 uh so it's not my first rodeo I kind of know what to expect um but

00:57:39.22 I thought it would be great we need to

00:57:41.15 do a break [ __ ] face break [ __ ] I wanted

00:57:44.23 to do it tomorrow after the colonoscopy I wanted to go from the hospital to

00:57:49.08 the break [ __ ] all looped up on the because you know they put they knock me

00:57:54.10 out right like they give you drugs I'm all loopy I'm all [ __ ] dumb uh I'll

00:57:58.14 be it's like a truth serum I won't be able to like I would have just been

00:58:03.09 wackadoo for hours and Eric was like absolutely not I was ready to do it

00:58:08.02 he there is no way that I'm going to put Geoff on camera after

00:58:16.06 an outpatient surgery they already did it

00:58:20.02 well 10 years ago I did it 10 years yeah I am not doing it [Laughter]

00:58:27.22 I am not doing that that's no we're not doing it tomorrow after he gets all the

00:58:33.11 stuff inside of him and then it's no no absolutely not no no Geoff carries that

00:58:39.18 show and goes like here's interesting facts about the cards I don't even know

00:58:45.09 what it would be what I don't either that's all of me so much god pacquiao

00:58:49.21 dollop

00:58:52.06 what facts would I come up with [ __ ]

00:58:55.05 blitzed out of my mind on uh on hospital drugs I have no it would have been so

00:59:00.12 much fun but I respect that ultimately I think eric's looking out for me I don't

00:59:04.05 think he's yeah maybe not he's going to look out for the show because I think it

00:59:07.11 would be great for the show but I do appreciate Eric looking out for me but I

00:59:13.03 also would love to have done it uh insane that would have been great insane

00:59:18.08 well you know show must go on and all it does should we talk about the jet ski

00:59:22.16 stuff you're the the big merch uh have we talked about that I don't think we

00:59:26.02 have let's why don't you cover that and then we'll wrap this up okay well I mean

00:59:29.20 I feel like it's really you're as the big jet ski guy I was excited to share

00:59:33.02 with you did you see I'd be shocked if you did this was a big week for jet ski

00:59:37.08 news it was a great jet ski week is it it's a good story there's a big star

00:59:40.17 I'll drop in the chat there are some farmers there's flooding in bc right now

00:59:45.14 farmers hopped on some jet skis save some cows oh my god skiing around

00:59:50.03 wait how do you say how do you get a cow

00:59:51.22 in a jet ski they told me no they didn't put the cow no they they were like

00:59:55.19 guiding them using the hood like they were yeah they were hurting them they

01:00:00.07 were sheep [Music]

01:00:01.18 yeah we when we go jet skiing we should play a game of chase where one of us is

01:00:07.08 dressed up as a sheep and the others dressed as a cow.

01:00:11.03 I mean Geoff did something similar instead of a cow though it was a dead

01:00:15.12 bloated deer

01:00:18.12 that was so gross it was a great week for duskys and we

01:00:22.04 have jet ski merch coming out on November 29th yeah I believe celebrate

01:00:26.23 the cows buy jet ski merchandise from face

01:00:31.09 uh on uh where to [ __ ] go on November 29th at 10 a.m central standard time

01:00:38.00 cyber Monday fill up your your cyber coffers with

01:00:43.09 jet ski related merchandise and and uh and uh

01:00:47.03 pay homage to those brave farmers in Canada who saved those cows with the power

01:00:52.12 yes that is exactly why we're doing jet ski merch it is to honor the Canadian

01:00:58.18 farmers yes there's no history or appreciation for jet skis on the show

01:01:03.07 I still haven't I still haven't been on a jet ski

01:01:06.23 that is the moment I'm excited to experience I'm ready for my life to

01:01:11.10 change do you think you'll go to 60

01:01:13.06 miles an hour I think I will probably have an experience like you did where I

01:01:17.00 will be just like doing little little speed little like just little crawling

01:01:22.10 almost across the water and then I'll get into it and we'll we will be flying

01:01:26.12 in in other merch news scrumping is is dead apparently according to the channel

01:01:30.15 it is all the scrumping signs no scripture

01:01:34.04 signs are sold out yeah they were like [ __ ] gone see ya that's it they were

01:01:39.05 made out of plastic I was imagining a nice solid metal sign was it a plastic

01:01:44.10 sign apparently it's a plastic plastic no scrubbing side

01:01:49.18 which originally greatly disappointed me

01:01:52.21 because I never actually touched one but then I just thought well that's that's

01:01:56.09 definitely face well you know I see what

01:01:58.09 you're saying in my head it was like one of those metal signs you would see like

01:02:02.00 posted next to a farm or whatever on the side of the road but I I did go to

01:02:06.07 lowe's the other day and I did look at some signs like no soliciting signs and

01:02:10.09 most of them were were the same material as the as the scrumping sign so I think

01:02:14.00 it might be a situation where the industry has moved on and are in our

01:02:18.03 heads that's very fair I cannot remember the last time I went sign buying so I

01:02:23.18 can't say that um I'm really regularly in the market and

01:02:28.19 know what the the typical experience is the plastic sign is pretty pretty uh

01:02:33.18 pretty commonplace these days okay today the the

01:02:36.04 that's never mind never mind that being said I I hope you got one because I

01:02:41.03 don't think we're making any more I think this was a special thing uh

01:02:45.11 so uh for all you that didn't get it I just I pray for your apples well what if

01:02:49.20 we brought back all of our limited items for rtx next time we do it like

01:02:55.09 unlimited rtx yeah like if wait what wait

01:02:58.10 well because they're unlimited for rtx so we bring them all back like we're on

01:03:03.16 we're limiting it it'd be re-limited but at rtx so

01:03:08.05 are you are you asking should we just make all of our collectible items no

01:03:12.14 longer collectible at rtx is that what you're presenting yeah we're unlimiting

01:03:16.06 it I don't know I just I just worry about our ability to let people know

01:03:19.11 that merch is coming out and by the time we've mentioned it it's already out we

01:03:23.07 just did a great job we just we let people know about the farmers

01:03:28.04 jet skills we're doing great let's just beat that epic

01:03:31.08 before we mentioned it that is true but we could have that we could have handled

01:03:34.15 the scrumping thing better we are victims of our own recording schedule

01:03:38.10 more than anything and you're colon and Andrews and andrew's illness yeah I

01:03:42.19 mean we we we've all had to cancel how big is a sack would you say how many

01:03:47.08 apples do you think should fit in a sack if you're gonna what's the minimum four

01:03:52.15 forty okay we're on the same sackers is is probably the biggest

01:03:57.14 size that you can sling over your shoulder and still carry around without

01:04:02.09 being weighed down I agree but I think sac I think like Santa claus

01:04:08.00 I think of a giant bag I have a bag with swagger in on it I have in my head and

01:04:13.15 and I'll be honest with you because I can't tell I got you know this is and

01:04:18.04 Eric will end but I'm we'll wrap it up with this

01:04:20.12 in the notes that I never got to of the 4000 things to talk about uh

01:04:24.15 a lot of them are apple related if I'm being honest with you oh and it's it's

01:04:28.22 given me pause and I want to ask before we go down this road are we nearing the

01:04:33.17 end of our apple related content or do we continue down this road because I was

01:04:39.18 going to build a prototype for an unscrumpable

01:04:42.21 uh like lockable apple sack that you could string over your shoulder that's

01:04:47.11 it that holds one apple with a strap and

01:04:49.14 then it's locked in some way so that you so it's like an unscrupable apple you

01:04:53.17 bring on the go with you it's I and I say apple sack just because apple sack

01:04:57.08 sounds good but it would only hold one it doesn't hold for to be honest that's

01:05:01.00 incredible because my next prototype I was gonna invent the apple pocket

01:05:05.16 what is after the grief I got last week about no

01:05:09.02 one storing an apple in the pocket I'm gonna make a dedicated pocket

01:05:14.00 I just I don't this is I love it we're sticking with apples baby I love it

01:05:19.18 I can't wait let's hit this podcast we can talk more about apples oh I can't

01:05:25.11 wait I just like this is this is like phase two of the fcu is the apple phase

01:05:30.19 we've already gone through [Laughter]

01:05:34.21 we're done with baseball that was phase one no baseball will come back

01:05:40.04 you can't give up on zimmer just in phase one but he will he's gonna

01:05:45.12 end it holy [ __ ] we gotta stop no no one

01:05:49.02 more thing no more things we gotta stop we gotta stop because I wanna talk to

01:05:52.21 you guys about zimmer all right okay uh uh I love you guys uh but hey if you

01:05:56.15 ever if you ever find yourself just woke up yeah if you ever fight yeah I feel a

01:06:00.00 little better than I said if you ever find yourself thinking like oh I haven't

01:06:03.02 talked to Geoff in a year I've ignored him and I've never played video games

01:06:06.08 with him maybe give him a ring he's not doing anything I promise thanks for

01:06:09.14 listening to face we've only played twice goodbye

01:06:21.01 you
