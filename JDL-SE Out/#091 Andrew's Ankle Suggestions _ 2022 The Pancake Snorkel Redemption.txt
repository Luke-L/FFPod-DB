00:00:23.03 [Music]

00:00:30.13 Hello and welcome to the spanky dandy old men can't say bro let's not argue

00:00:36.17 about the moon landing podcast my name is Geoff Ramsey welcome

00:00:41.01 to you the audience your name is whatever the [ __ ] it is also with me uh

00:00:45.18 Andrew and Gavin this is episode 91.

00:00:48.12 That came through my speakers for some reason did it how how else do you get it

00:00:52.12 spanky danky is his name spanky danky so I was directionally correct I was close

00:00:57.10 spanky danky what you get there audience uh in that intro and also Gavin because

00:01:02.02 of course he wasn't here that is a recap of this episode's pleasantries couldn't

00:01:06.18 bring you along for the pleasantries but wanted to give you a little nugget of

00:01:10.04 what it was because it was a wild ride for the seven minutes I was involved and

00:01:13.14 it had already been going for a bit so when did the pleasantries start with

00:01:17.20 Andrew like 20 minutes ago no I sh well listen I showed up 15 minutes to go

00:01:22.02 everybody else showed up 10 minutes I'd say okay I showed up maybe they they

00:01:25.21 were going when I when I clicked in there there was a laughter and nick was

00:01:30.02 like this is already off the rails and based on last week's pleasantries I

00:01:34.21 decided not to attend this week's pleasantries

00:01:37.07 on the grounds that they're worthless you missed a lot we heard about two old

00:01:40.21 men who tried to one-up each other in a Walmart about whether they were both

00:01:45.16 directly involved with either the moon landing or the covering up of the moon

00:01:50.23 landing we learned about spanky dandy the hottest new opera

00:01:54.19 what about this Gavin next next time we record whatever that is

00:01:59.19 I will not show up until one and you can show up 10 minutes early and you can

00:02:03.19 have the pleasantries experience why don't we just all turn up at the same

00:02:07.08 time and record it all for the audience to listen to all of because the

00:02:11.06 pleasantries are a great part that I hate the message they really love you uh

00:02:14.15 gav you came up in the pleasantries we told we regaled your bob vila gogurt

00:02:18.22 experience oh yeah we talked about that a bit we discovered that the venn

00:02:24.00 diagram of people who make a logan's run reference and say bro is me [Laughter]

00:02:32.06 we serve a jam-packed seven minutes I'll be honest this week's pleasantries

00:02:36.19 sounded better than last week uh well we

00:02:38.16 just I think the problem is when you get

00:02:39.09 here we just end up starting the show so there are no pleasantries it just

00:02:43.02 immediately goes in so that's why it's offering so what you're saying is it's

00:02:46.20 physically impossible for me to attend pleasantries if I'm the last to join I

00:02:51.05 think the last person who joins whoever that is doesn't get to partake in the

00:02:55.00 place all right so next week you're out so I'm out

00:02:58.08 I'm willing to step out for pleasantries and I welcome you to get in 10 minutes

00:03:02.12 early I agree with nick there was less pressure on these pleasantries this week

00:03:05.16 last week there's a lot of pleasantry pressure that's a good point I think you

00:03:10.17 just need to naturally show my power might go off yeah you were you having a

00:03:14.21 rough day huh buddy yeah got booted from a gta video I was in earlier because

00:03:18.20 we're powering off and uh could happen again today oh well it's still today I

00:03:23.03 mean now we're in the midst of another uh snowstorm in Austin so the entire

00:03:27.14 state has shut down things are flying on my house though bit warmer this year

00:03:31.08 though yeah well last time was a historic cold right yeah it's only minus

00:03:36.03 three today which is definitely enough to grind the whole of Texas to a halt

00:03:41.02 but last year it was like minus 16 or something yeah it was pretty sucky it's

00:03:44.18 gonna continue to get colder though it's going to be even colder tomorrow right

00:03:48.02 here wow nick said is this is this gavin's print

00:03:51.00 the law episode uh too soon to tell but quite possibly quite possibly do you

00:03:56.08 have a generator Gavin uh I've got batteries well what does that mean what

00:04:01.05 I got [ __ ] batteries I don't know what that means what do you mean

00:04:05.18 your batteries explode Geoff has batteries

00:04:08.21 yeah I'm not talking about just double a I've got like large

00:04:13.16 block like camping batteries garage is full of ac delco car batteries

00:04:19.05 just in case I got all these double I got a million

00:04:22.10 [ __ ] double eyes I'm ready it's like having a generator but it doesn't last

00:04:26.09 as long but I don't have to put petrol in it that's fair what do you okay so

00:04:30.12 let's say you lose power and you got to use what's the first item that's getting

00:04:34.15 hooked up is it the fridge what are you protecting the internet

00:04:37.21 that's number one for you how many of the batteries do you have what are we

00:04:41.05 working with here eight eight okay that's pretty good I don't I use them

00:04:44.17 for like filming in the quarry typically but uh comes in handy when all the

00:04:48.08 power's off well I mean I just turn on the internet we like rash in the

00:04:51.11 internet mainly because it's nice to you

00:04:54.15 know hear updates about the world and uh yes maybe quickly grab some content to

00:05:00.15 watch with dinner for your crippling porn addiction right uh yeah

00:05:05.11 I can't imagine like pre-downloading why is it like the two thousands

00:05:11.11 that would be really extreme not like I I need I need to pleasure

00:05:16.02 myself now but I'm gonna do it later imagine scheduling that.

00:05:22.21 I'm not I'm not horny now but I'll get it down in case of horny break glass.

00:05:32.04 I did not think that throwaway joke was gonna was gonna result in so much funny

00:05:37.16 that's awesome Kevin I don't I don't remember if we talked about it in a

00:05:40.22 recording or if it was outside of the fact but Gavin shared his battery

00:05:46.00 holder thing at some point where it's like

00:05:48.00 I'm just imagining that for like porn hard drives like categorized he's got

00:05:52.15 different things I love the idea of just he's putting on

00:05:55.20 a little usb stick a few porn videos that you've never seen before that you

00:06:00.00 know that you need offline in case your raid goes down

00:06:04.23 I like the idea of you having to pick between like porn or your fridge like

00:06:09.05 you've got one more battery I think I'm gonna do that I think I'm

00:06:12.20 gonna cut a little hole in my wall and put in like a emergency pawn glass

00:06:17.19 well wait what if you get one of those fridges that have like a screen in the

00:06:21.04 front you could be a double threat you could just throw your porn I don't know

00:06:24.12 the front of the fridge wanking while you're facing your fridge is a bit weird

00:06:27.14 in the middle of the kitchen yeah I think having a [ __ ] porn stash in

00:06:32.12 case that a storm takes out your power is

00:06:34.17 beyond the realm of like normalcy I mean that's just an area where the digital

00:06:38.09 world has kind of screwed us because you

00:06:40.15 know back in the day people would resort

00:06:43.11 to magazines which are available offline yeah yeah or vhs can I can I get a porn

00:06:47.07 mag at a store like I don't think this playboy stop publishing right they don't

00:06:51.18 make magazines anymore I think that they started again maybe

00:06:54.15 but there are other porn companies that still make magazines I believe it's such

00:06:58.03 an interesting line of thought of being like I'm horny I got to go to the

00:07:02.06 7-eleven dude it used to be imagine if you were like I wanna I wanna I don't

00:07:05.22 wanna look at a picture of people [ __ ]

00:07:08.11 but I would like to watch a video of it you had to go to the other side of town

00:07:12.02 to a disgusting dark building and then stare at the ground for 20 minutes while

00:07:16.02 you try to find your flavor of porn in a porn theater

00:07:20.00 knowing in the back there were dudes beaten off in little cubicles the world

00:07:23.15 has changed for the better rapidly I don't understand those theaters though

00:07:27.07 like people would go in and not wank is that the point of them what do you mean

00:07:30.12 like it was always a big deal when people got caught monkeying off in a

00:07:34.02 attacking like Herman yeah we were talking about I didn't want to do it

00:07:38.10 yeah he was in another theater and I also think that that

00:07:41.12 turned out to be sort of he sort of got [ __ ] over by that like that turned out

00:07:45.03 not to be like that turned out to be misreported in some way I believe oh was

00:07:48.23 it like a Richard gere gerbil situation no I think there was something to it but

00:07:52.17 I think I I don't know I don't know the story but I think it wasn't as nefarious

00:07:55.23 as it seemed however what's his face from uh from all the Christopher guest

00:08:00.17 movies I think his was legit who who is that Fred Willard oh

00:08:04.04 r.i.p yeah he's great did he have one of those yeah he got busted jacking off in

00:08:08.11 a theater like in his 70s [Laughter]

00:08:10.19 this is kind of funny depending on the context

00:08:14.00 yeah I guess it really depends on the theater or what was playing for my my

00:08:19.01 level of okay with it the weirdest thing

00:08:22.00 is it was it was uh a mighty wind he was jacking off

00:08:26.02 he saw bob balaban whoever his name is.

00:08:30.17 I agree I don't I don't know I don't know what the point it's just like a

00:08:35.16 weird thing to people would you think people have recorded like bootleg

00:08:39.08 you imagine like bootleg theater porn as opposed to like when people would like

00:08:44.17 illegally film movies have you ever watched somebody illegally film

00:08:47.21 something in a movie theater before no no I remember one time I was at the show

00:08:52.08 and it was like I don't remember what the movie was but it had been out a long

00:08:55.22 time and it was just me and this one guy in the theater and he pulled out a

00:08:59.18 [ __ ] tripod and he put a camera on a tripod at the back of the theater

00:09:04.12 this guy's wild did he get cool no I don't I think he I

00:09:07.12 don't know what he was there for he left like shortly after but he he pulled a

00:09:11.01 tripod out and I was like this is [ __ ] ridiculous like the level of

00:09:14.13 confidence what if he just had one of those what are those things that people

00:09:18.17 put on tripods to see if they're like architect people they have like levels

00:09:22.19 on them and stuff they're levels survey equipment yeah yeah I just see

00:09:26.15 them all the time I just I have no idea what they're doing ever I don't know

00:09:29.16 it's possible he worked for the theater I don't even remember if he I saw a

00:09:33.12 camera but he had a tripod and I just thought this is ridiculou like to bring

00:09:36.22 in the confidence of bringing in a tripod is impressive to me I love that

00:09:41.04 level of not caring the world has changed a lot since those days it has

00:09:46.00 I'd like to see somebody in there with a boom mic

00:09:49.12 I mean isn't this essentially an entire episode of Seinfeld when Kramer got

00:09:54.01 caught up in uh pirating movies and is it uh it was death blow was the movie

00:09:58.09 they were trying to that's a great fake movie name death blow yeah yeah what's

00:10:03.09 the one in twilight that's another great

00:10:06.19 fake move it's like killer punch did you hear that someone said someone texted

00:10:10.03 what the [ __ ] was that.

00:10:24.00 Jesus Christ that's awesome have we talked have you talked about what's

00:10:28.12 what's happened to you Andrew uh what what well what do you mean in the

00:10:32.13 pleasantries in the last week yeah well I mean that was a strange

00:10:36.16 pivot because I felt like you were talking about the text thing which I

00:10:39.03 definitely have talked about well yeah we already talked about that what we

00:10:42.04 haven't talked about is how you're basically disabled this week no well you

00:10:46.00 know what the worst part of that whole experience is is that there's nothing

00:10:49.11 all that entertaining about anything that happened I was genuinely mad that

00:10:53.22 well I had to go to the hospital unexpectedly because I had a foot issue

00:10:57.17 and typically my ankle but things heal in about a week and it was not healing

00:11:01.23 so I was like I think I need to finally get this checked out so I did the

00:11:07.12 problem is I live up like the the most ridiculous 12

00:11:11.00 staircase setup and I couldn't go ahead as you can see I

00:11:14.06 feel like Gavin and I were very supportive of you in that moment

00:11:17.13 throwing out lots of options for ways to get down the stairs.

00:11:22.02 I don't remember if Gavin made a suggestion Geoff suggested I sled down it

00:11:26.19 like jackass cause you sent us a picture of a flight of stairs and then you said

00:11:32.08 something like I have to do that four times yes it's a lot

00:11:36.17 it's a lot of stairs so I wheeled out I called an ambulance that came and they

00:11:42.09 they evaluated I explained the situation I think the funniest part of that well

00:11:46.23 there are two parts of it that were funny one uh I've been reluctant I think

00:11:51.08 it's partially like an anxiety thing of not wanting to get checked out and also

00:11:54.20 feeling like I'm not like dying I don't think so I'm fine it heals in a week

00:11:59.08 like whatever no big deal so when we're going over like all the different things

00:12:03.06 the guy's like are you taking any advil or Tylenol or whatever and I was like

00:12:06.13 yeah I'm taking quite a bit right now the manager

00:12:09.15 yeah and he's like well are you do you have any side effects from that and I'm

00:12:12.15 like no you know what my stomach has been burning a little bit uh because of

00:12:15.20 it and I know that could be a by-product of using those in large large quantities

00:12:19.16 but outside of that I'm doing pretty good he's like any [ __ ] or anything any

00:12:25.09 [ __ ] in your blood great slum Andrew any blood

00:12:28.15 he asked any blood in your [ __ ]

00:12:30.12 essentially and I was like no I'm good there no problems there and he's like oh

00:12:34.23 okay good cause if that if you had that that's when you really want to get

00:12:38.02 checked out I was just quietly like [ __ ]

00:12:41.00 like yep I was freaking out last night so we get through that and then uh

00:12:45.09 they're like okay we've looked at your foot we have this these issues with it

00:12:48.22 they're like we think you should get checked out I think it would make sense

00:12:52.17 for us to take you to the hospital we're

00:12:54.19 gonna do that now we just need to figure

00:12:56.15 out like the best way to accomplish this because you can't walk at all and your

00:13:00.17 stairs are ridiculously narrow and long and twisty so that in your house at this

00:13:04.06 point they're in my house yeah it's two guys how hard was it for them to find

00:13:07.06 your house did they have to follow the mcdonald's guy they had to yeah

00:13:11.13 they had to call the mcdonald's guy they had to be waived out as a whole ordeal

00:13:15.08 but they get there and they're like we're gonna need to call we're gonna

00:13:18.16 call the fire department essentially to like figure out get more muscle they

00:13:23.01 have other tools we'll collaborate we'll get this we'll figure out a way for you

00:13:26.21 to go down I was like okay cool so they do that and then like 10 minutes later

00:13:32.15 there's seven firefighters on my stairwell all looking up it's like a

00:13:36.06 team huddle and they're just going back and forth on what what the plan should

00:13:41.03 be I'm just listening and before any of this happened I

00:13:44.05 thought should I just because everything else is fine I thought should I just

00:13:48.13 slide down the stairs and then just wait at the bottom and

00:13:52.07 that would I could I think I could accomplish this yeah like a little butt

00:13:55.08 shimmy like a little button like a dog doing a butt shimmy across all my stairs

00:13:59.08 that's like I think I could accomplish this and but I thought I'll wait and

00:14:02.22 I'll hear their opinions I don't know what options they have so there's like

00:14:06.18 nine people at this point and they came to the conclusion that the

00:14:10.11 easiest way for me to do this would be is if I just slid down the stairs so I

00:14:15.09 have seven jacked firefighters all around me

00:14:18.08 just watching they turned into like just a peanut gallery they just were like

00:14:23.12 there for moral support at that point so I asked jimmy down my stairs and then

00:14:28.23 they'd grab my my desk chair put it behind me I'd sit and then I'd push

00:14:33.08 myself in the chair to the next set of stairs

00:14:35.22 and then I just did that all the way down to the front door to get in the in

00:14:40.02 the bed I like that that was the result of their huddle like they're like that

00:14:43.12 was yeah

00:14:46.21 do you realize that you just lived out every lonely bored housewives fantasy to

00:14:53.02 slide down carpeted stairs into the waiting arms of seven firefighters I

00:14:58.02 just thought the idea was somewhere else in Canada they're like

00:15:01.09 freaking restaurants on fire though you have to wait we got everyone

00:15:06.13 deployed to us to a guy with a swollen ankle we got a

00:15:10.19 stair slide situation yeah we got a stair slide they were just all they did

00:15:16.17 was say good job and also like did it sound patronizing or like support

00:15:20.06 no it seemed genuine there was a lot of good jobs and like oh you should take a

00:15:23.23 minute to take your breath like it was a lot of trying to make it I'm good I'm

00:15:28.10 fine we're just going to do this so then I I accomplished that

00:15:32.07 oh yeah it was and then it was a noise but it was funny but then you had to do

00:15:35.12 it in reverse I assume when you came home no well that was

00:15:38.12 that was the thing I was like well how am I gonna I'm not really sure what the

00:15:41.21 game plan is for getting back up and uh I just was on

00:15:46.00 so many with the whole thing the whole exiting process wasn't the best where

00:15:49.20 I they did x-rays and blood work and all this stuff and then they gave me what

00:15:53.05 they believe was the issue with it and they gave me a bunch of

00:15:57.22 pain pills for it essentially and uh the person's like hey can you can

00:16:01.09 you walk and I was like I don't think so

00:16:03.07 but I don't know I haven't tried in like

00:16:05.03 four or five hours and they're like okay well do you own they didn't offer me

00:16:08.13 anything they weren't like we have crutches or a wheelchair they're like do

00:16:11.15 you own any of that stuff and I was like not really no

00:16:15.02 they're like well can you walk and I was like I don't think so and they're like

00:16:18.21 cool we'll come back in like 15 minutes to try to figure this out

00:16:23.03 and uh they never came back so I just slowly limped out of my room

00:16:28.10 uh with I didn't my foot was too swollen to put on my shoes so I'm barefoot just

00:16:32.13 slowly staggering through the hospital by myself and then just go out the door

00:16:37.03 and hop in a car and get taken home and then I just

00:16:39.17 walked up all the stairs just very slowly using the railing are you wearing

00:16:44.06 regulation Andrew panton shorts this whole time I had been wearing regulation

00:16:48.12 underwear for like the past six days well not even some so you weren't even

00:16:52.10 in shorts no I was going full winnie that I was winnie the pooh in it for a

00:16:56.10 lot of the days all right and then no I put on shorts uh

00:16:59.22 for for the train so you didn't know in your shuffles down the street I did not.

00:17:10.05 [Laughter]

00:17:15.09 We.

00:17:18.23 Hey can I ask you guys a question yeah of course I was listening to the episode

00:17:23.19 that just came out which you know I make a practice of not doing but for some

00:17:28.02 reason well honestly it's because I can't I this [ __ ]

00:17:31.11 covet dude it's driving me nuts I can't go anywhere I can't do anything I'm so

00:17:34.22 [ __ ] bored so uh I was listening I I got so miserable that I decided to

00:17:40.04 listen to our content which was face stadium jingle jingle jingle yes

00:17:44.07 what the f did we ever answer what the jingle jingle jingle mystery is did we

00:17:48.15 cover that we have it but I I don't know I kind of

00:17:51.14 want to see you you said it in two episodes and so this this would be the

00:17:56.08 third you know what it's funny Geoff is we have done zero in the history of

00:18:01.07 these and this entire podcast we have never done any show prep together as a

00:18:05.12 group or exchange notes and what we want to talk about and I attempt it once and

00:18:10.19 I feel like I got [ __ ] on by you for it in the episode

00:18:13.07 I got made by you I was definitely making fun of your process it was

00:18:17.03 ridiculous but I still loved it what do you mean it was ridiculous I was writing

00:18:22.02 notes to like to try to distribute like this many

00:18:25.07 album [ __ ] tracks and stuff it was great I loved it I absolutely loved it

00:18:29.14 I'm saying that I tried to do prep for one time and I got [ __ ] on for it so I

00:18:33.11 don't need to bring up the jingle jingle because I didn't it's not needed

00:18:37.20 apparently we're not going to do that no show prep but

00:18:40.13 I want to hear people's predictions I have no idea what just happened

00:18:45.03 three episodes ago you said I'm gonna tell you what it is in two because

00:18:48.16 no because that was under the assumption

00:18:50.21 that we're recording 12 episodes in four days which is what I was under so I

00:18:55.18 thought this is the first time we need to

00:18:57.14 and people seem to be interested in the jingle jingle jingle thing right and I

00:19:01.14 also talked to you about the jingle jingle jingle thing and discussing it

00:19:05.01 and the timing and discussing it I don't remember yeah clearly clearly you don't

00:19:09.06 remember do you telling me I know the answer to the jingle jingle jingle

00:19:14.00 mystery you know no he doesn't you didn't say that in

00:19:16.09 front of him no I didn't tell him what what the answer to the mystery is but I

00:19:20.17 told you when we should talk about it and why we should talk about that and

00:19:24.14 you agreed and then you just said nope and just flush that information away no

00:19:28.11 I don't remember that part of it I don't know you were not there for that Gavin

00:19:31.22 oh it was during the pre-show that we always do we prepare our where we

00:19:35.19 prepare our bits I'm pretty sure it was a slack conversation between you and I I

00:19:39.23 don't know I just want to know I I'm right there with the audience wondering

00:19:43.07 what the [ __ ] it is I just want to make are you going to address it someday

00:19:46.13 absolutely okay I don't care when as long as it doesn't get dropped no it

00:19:49.18 will never get dropped I just I'd I'd like to see a week of people predicting

00:19:52.18 I think you're blue ball in the audience because they uh you teased it you're I

00:19:57.01 [ __ ] you're the worst and you don't mean to be you're being the worst right

00:20:00.08 now you have no idea how annoying you're being right now Geoff doesn't remember

00:20:04.21 the instructions that I'm not allowed to know he's ridiculous he's infuriating I

00:20:09.13 love you Geoff but you're infuriating I mean in fairness there's nothing more

00:20:14.04 forgettable than the episode recorded between the one you're in the middle of

00:20:17.19 making and the one that just came out like I couldn't tell you what discussed

00:20:22.02 a week ago no clue that's why I asked if

00:20:24.00 we covered it because I was listening to the episode and I thought jingle jingle

00:20:27.04 jingle do I know what that is and I thought we must have dealt with it no I

00:20:30.11 thought [ __ ] I better ask the guys because I uh my old ass forgot so if you

00:20:35.01 had told me yeah we covered that in episode 90 idiot I would have been like

00:20:38.12 oh I'll wait till it comes out and listen to it we have not but you know

00:20:41.12 what we have we have gotten a lot of and I want to hear

00:20:44.16 when you hear your two two opinions on this since the field research has been

00:20:48.17 done getting a lot of successful reports

00:20:50.20 back on the hot cake happy meal hack any any opinions changed any reversive

00:20:55.10 thoughts you're both against it I'm seeing a lot of reports of it working

00:20:59.16 it's beyond just my store oh is that what the jingle jingle jingle is

00:21:03.14 no has nothing to do with that completely unrelated

00:21:06.13 refresh my memory no opinion you guys were both very strongly this isn't a

00:21:10.12 hack this is [ __ ] the research has come out I've seen a bunch of people

00:21:14.02 report that they've gotten three hot cakes with their happy meal

00:21:17.02 unfortunately appears to be more of a Canadian thing than it is in america

00:21:21.03 doesn't seem like many American locations have it all right let me ask

00:21:25.16 you this I'll answer your I'll answer your question with a question thank you

00:21:29.08 I appreciate that how kind of you so you're buying I'm gonna make sure I get

00:21:33.22 this straight you're buying pancakes from mcdonald's and you're getting an

00:21:37.22 extra one and you think it's this amazing hack right yes don't you have 70

00:21:42.12 pounds of pancake mix in your house let me counter this for you okay this is a

00:21:48.00 really you're absolutely correct I do I'm not saying

00:21:51.01 that this is for me the most cost effective thing like obviously I'm

00:21:55.03 taking a luxury and I'm ordering a thing I could technically make myself one

00:21:59.12 pancakes at mcdonald's taste differently than the ones I make I really enjoy the

00:22:03.06 taste of the mcdonald's hotcakes two it's a cheaper way to get a thing I

00:22:07.12 enjoy and it's a small luxury I feel for myself every week I'm not the

00:22:11.23 best at eating breakfast I forget a lot of the time to just eat it's a meal I

00:22:15.11 don't always have but I've made it a tradition that on a recording day I get

00:22:19.09 to treat myself in the morning and I at least have a breakfast going into it

00:22:22.16 what if you take two of the mcdonald's ones and make the third one yourself

00:22:28.06 like like get there to what if you donate your pancake mix to mcdonald's

00:22:33.12 and then they can make your pancakes for

00:22:36.04 you oh and then when you get the pancake back you'll know that maybe some of it

00:22:39.12 came from you I've been looking at donating most of my pancake mix but

00:22:42.20 unfortunately with kovid and stuff there's not a lot of places that are

00:22:46.15 taking it to Mexicans [Music]

00:22:50.13 Eric said I don't think mcdonald's wants anything from Andre I think that's

00:22:56.13 correct I think it's a factual statement

00:22:59.20 outside of outside of one particular set of items from them I I think if the if

00:23:04.10 the world ends if there's big like big fat nuclear winter

00:23:08.02 you're gonna have the the weirdest collection of stuff you're gonna be

00:23:11.14 a bottle cap millionaire just from people hear about the guy who's got the

00:23:15.12 pancakes and the sauces it's like not something you'd expect from a regular

00:23:19.06 abode this is what I'm gonna say to that though okay let's say nuclear winter

00:23:23.03 happens right I'd rather have the group of people that are coming into my house

00:23:27.09 they're they're coming after if if they if there's like a takeover scenario

00:23:31.11 people like whatever I'd rather have the pancake people than all the horny

00:23:35.12 jerk-off people that you will have with your [ __ ] car batteries

00:23:40.04 you are in the jack off capitol in Austin

00:23:43.07 I want to get electrocuted and jack off at the same time

00:23:47.00 we gotta see the battery beat off dude the battery beater

00:23:53.05 that's an excellent point Andrew this is gonna eat on this fridge I don't mind I

00:23:58.05 can make I can share the pancakes we wanted to do a pancake bath at some

00:24:02.05 point but I think that's a terrible idea I guess I talked about mixing it right

00:24:05.13 when I had my pancake maker in the bathroom yeah what if we lit a fire

00:24:09.12 under the tub could you just make a big pancake

00:24:13.01 would it cook through I don't I don't know how that you'd have to like balance

00:24:18.05 it right so it's not melting the tub there's probably a certain distance you

00:24:23.01 could have where the music flow we could put you in a tub with pancake mix cook

00:24:27.00 it up and you have to eat your way out no yeah I don't think that would work I

00:24:32.04 feel like well I think it would burn me right uh we'd like we'd stir it

00:24:37.03 that's that what if we put you in a fire retardant

00:24:40.09 suit okay if we did that then yeah I'd absolutely be completely fine with this

00:24:44.13 premise but it can't be I think it needs to be larger it needs to be you know

00:24:48.14 like in a movie like in creep show when [ __ ] ted Danson gets buried up to his

00:24:52.19 neck and sand like it needs to be that but pancake but you need to have your

00:24:56.04 head underneath because you gotta eat out no

00:24:59.18 my head isn't gonna be underneath the pancake we need you basically in a tub

00:25:03.16 with a snorlax oh yeah and then as as it

00:25:06.06 sets we rip the snorkel out and you have

00:25:08.14 to scuff your way out no this is not the [ __ ] worst David Blaine stunt of all

00:25:13.00 time give me air allow me to breathe and I was coming down the snorkel I don't

00:25:17.07 want a snorkel why can't I just have my head exposed and start slowly eating

00:25:21.10 away from just my neck area down loosen it up then I get an arm free what are

00:25:25.15 you not a snorkel guy I'm not a snorkel guy I've never been a snorkel guy I'm

00:25:29.06 bad at the snorkel I've tried it once I wasn't good at it don't trust it is it

00:25:32.21 just the act of breathing underwater you don't like just knowing that your head

00:25:37.05 is underwater yeah it's not a thing I regularly do

00:25:39.19 and I think I tried it once as a kid and

00:25:41.19 it went horribly wrong and I just didn't do it again let me let me posit this

00:25:46.13 then uh maybe it's time for snorkel redemption and uh

00:25:50.21 pancake snorkeling I think sounds like the perfect vehicle this is

00:25:56.00 the other 2022 the pancake snorkel redemption I love it I don't trust being

00:26:00.10 blinded essentially and unable to move with the two of you [ __ ] of being in

00:26:04.18 the area and just being able to do whatever you want I don't want I we've

00:26:07.18 talked about I've let Geoff bury me in a coffin once I did this

00:26:13.11 Andrew we nailed it down and then we covered it in dirt

00:26:17.01 what's in there what does that mean what does that mean how far down was he how

00:26:21.13 much dirt did he have uh not that far not that much but that's not exactly no

00:26:26.09 [ __ ] exactly you just laid down in a bed and they poured a pebble over you

00:26:30.23 and you're like [ __ ] I had an air hole had an air pipe and there was a big

00:26:35.04 like digger putting mud on me okay how about if you [ __ ] have the Ryan

00:26:38.22 Reynolds buried experience you get buried like six feet all you get is a

00:26:42.21 lighter and a phone then I'll do pancake thing no problem well does that mean we

00:26:46.23 can put you six feet under pancake because we're talking inches here man

00:26:51.06 yeah it's got to equate I would go six feet under pancake okay can I get any

00:26:55.06 condiments any any any topping any sides with this do I get like some syrup yeah

00:26:59.12 we'll give you like we'll give you like a bag full of little butter pat since an

00:27:04.19 individual bag of syrup that you can rip open

00:27:08.07 am I allowed to use it as lubrication to try to squeeze out of the pancake yes

00:27:13.15 okay well this is it's you eat how you eat Andrew I'm not going to get in I

00:27:17.11 don't I don't just like you of eating pancake with a shovel like having that

00:27:21.18 much that you need to like dig up I like

00:27:24.21 the idea of using syrup as loop it's not the only idea that your body is the

00:27:28.13 cereal is the syrup syrup syrup xm I feel like I'd get all

00:27:33.03 slippery if I covered myself with syrup but I think there's a window I think

00:27:36.01 you're right it eventually hardens and then would become an issue but I think

00:27:39.12 there'd be a brief window in which I'd be all slippery [Applause]

00:27:45.14 when you use the bathroom you always close the door behind you right you

00:29:05.16 online therapy relationships take work a lot of us will drop anything to go help

00:29:11.04 someone we care about we'll go out of our way to treat other people well but

00:29:14.14 how often do we give ourselves the same treatment this is something that I have

00:29:19.05 absolutely struggled with in my life and still have issues with it at times

00:29:22.20 I found therapy to be very helpful in dealing with it as well as some forms of

00:29:27.15 self-care that I've worked out in kind of the last few years but this month

00:29:31.22 better help online therapy wants to remind you to take care of your most

00:29:35.10 important relationship the one you have with yourself others hitting the gym

00:29:40.15 making time for your haircut or even trying therapy you are your greatest

00:29:44.03 asset so invest the time and effort into yourself like you do for other people

00:29:48.16 if you're somebody who is considering therapy but just haven't pushed forward

00:29:53.08 with it maybe because it can be scary I know I was certainly scared the first

00:29:56.15 time I started therapy or uh worried about the stigma that could

00:30:01.01 be attached with it I I suggest you please attempt it it's

00:30:04.19 something that I found to be incredibly helpful

00:30:07.06 and I hope it would be helpful for you as well better help is online therapy

00:30:44.10 I found out something recently Andrew about yeah about where you live is this

00:30:49.14 about like the maple syrup reserves or something I'm assuming Vancouver has

00:30:53.16 banned doorknobs starting march 2014 all new buildings erupt in the city will

00:30:57.11 have to include lever handles on their doors rather than around and not thanks

00:31:01.20 to not only do a lot of the comet leavers agree with

00:31:05.15 me on the doorknob front the entirety of Vancouver knobs are illegal on new

00:31:11.15 builds in Vancouver since 2014.

00:31:14.10 Did you have any idea of this no weird

00:31:18.21 they're trying to Andrew they're trying to take your doorknob freedom I'm okay

00:31:23.21 with that as I said I'm kind of indifferent to the

00:31:26.14 I don't really I'm trying to think of like the last time I encountered a

00:31:29.16 doorknob in the wild I don't think it's it's been a while it's clearly not been

00:31:32.22 since 2013. That makes no sense I guess they won what a weird what a weird thing

00:31:37.02 to outlaw people without functioning hands to be able to use doors it makes

00:31:40.17 total sense that doesn't make sense that

00:31:42.16 does make sense I was gonna say why like what would be the the thing that would

00:31:46.12 lead to that level of of wanting it changed like who would bring that to the

00:31:50.17 floor to get that approved but that that makes sense yeah now that you mentioned

00:31:54.10 that that part yeah that is a fun fact Gavin it is illegal so what do you think

00:31:58.14 there's somebody who's rebellious that's like I'm gonna put a [ __ ] doorknob

00:32:02.10 I'm doing it do you think you can go to the local

00:32:05.08 home depot in Vancouver and be like yeah I'd like to buy one of these doorknobs

00:32:08.12 and the guy's like I can sell to you but

00:32:10.12 I have to let you know you can't install it I don't think they're even on the

00:32:14.05 shelves I bet he takes you around the back of the store yeah and there's like

00:32:17.21 there's like a rag over a load of boxes of door knobs I was gonna say if you

00:32:21.09 wanted a door knob you can only buy them through the hot dog guy in front of the

00:32:25.07 store that's the only place it's technically within the grounds of

00:32:28.23 the building but they're not associated with it it's a backdoor deal do you have

00:32:32.03 hot dog guys in the front of your home depot too absolutely yeah it's it's a

00:32:35.18 great staple it's a staple of home depot that must be like ev every home depot

00:32:39.15 must have a hot dog guy in front of them or a taco guy in Texas it's not every

00:32:43.18 home depot but a lot of them do and they have different agreements depending on

00:32:48.00 the store so they're typically not hired by the store but it was an idea that

00:32:52.16 essentially and it's sort of up to debate who is the first person to do it

00:32:57.07 but the common thread was uh like a place where people could buy a snack

00:33:00.22 while getting a product I watched the whole thing about hot dogs and home

00:33:05.03 depot and that thing but I don't remember

00:33:07.12 a lot of the details on it it was yeah it's just funny that like it's awesome

00:33:11.16 too because they're very territorial because there are some lows that do the

00:33:15.03 same thing and there's like a real rivalry between the lowe's hot dog

00:33:18.15 people and the home depot hot dog people they're like no we don't [ __ ] around

00:33:21.18 with Lois are you a home depot or a lowe's person I don't think I have

00:33:25.17 lowe's in Canada there's at least not one where I live I don't think you know

00:33:30.12 what's weird is to like because of covid I've I've remained in my space so as

00:33:35.08 much as possible for like three years now so I don't necessarily know what

00:33:39.12 buildings are in different parts of the city I just haven't visited I was uh

00:33:43.19 looking at a Japanese restaurant that's my favorite in the city and I was just

00:33:48.07 scrolling through Google images of it and uh I was like ah this idiot took a

00:33:52.16 photo of the wrong restaurant what a what a ridiculous thing that is and then

00:33:56.02 I realized it was the right restaurant they just remodeled and I haven't been

00:33:59.14 there in like three years because of coven so it's wild so if we do have lows

00:34:04.11 I'm not aware of it but I guess it's possible that it exists hey it's weird

00:34:08.13 to live in go ahead no go ahead before it's weird to live in what I was going

00:34:11.13 to say it's weird to live in a small town and not feel like you know all the

00:34:15.09 main stores to it that's been a strange by-product of code that was weird Geoff

00:34:19.09 simultaneously let you continue but also like started telling his [ __ ] at the

00:34:23.11 same time did I you were like before no go ahead before.

00:34:31.16 I'm all discombobulated why is that why are you oh I'm just I'm just [ __ ] all

00:34:37.00 loopy from cold medicine [ __ ] oh yeah and [ __ ] being sequestered

00:34:41.12 quarantined whatever uh I have three little things I'd like to talk about

00:34:45.08 before we end but if I I don't know what else you guys want to cover we're only

00:34:48.19 halfway through yeah if not feel free I'd love to hear your things I saw a uh

00:34:53.02 this is just a comment I saw on the site I believe I was looking uh for the last

00:34:58.04 episode uh someone named mr Steele crayon said we should make baseball bats

00:35:04.15 that have door handles instead of knobs and sell them which you know

00:35:08.14 I gotta say I think he's on to something there I

00:35:11.23 mean that'd probably do better than the skateboard I was yeah I was gonna try to

00:35:15.16 build one for the recording of this episode but I got distracted I will uh

00:35:19.14 we could sell them in Vancouver we could only sell them in Vancouver

00:35:23.01 and technically we shouldn't have been sending those baseball bats to Vancouver

00:35:27.05 Jesus Christ we were sending illegal knobs

00:35:30.07 it gonna be yeah functional door handle like is it gonna actually be able to

00:35:34.13 turn I think I would assume so I hope big

00:35:37.14 I hope big handle doesn't get uh doesn't uh hear about us and crush us with the

00:35:41.17 door handle lobby uh I'd be okay as long

00:35:44.03 as we firmly align with big knob I'm not scared of being handled as long as we

00:35:48.14 are close to big knob as long as we're close to big mouth yeah the other thing

00:35:51.15 is real fast uh so the other day I haven't opened it up yet uh but I know

00:35:55.22 they're there uh I was gonna wait till I'm covered free but uh the other day uh

00:36:01.03 a box of [ __ ] wrist pockets showed up at my

00:36:04.06 house oh my god we made them yeah I gotta remember I gotta

00:36:08.13 here's the problem somebody's gotta tell them I I don't know that I'm always

00:36:13.17 serious when I say we we should make this stuff we have meetings and in more

00:36:19.09 than one meeting you're adamant about making these this isn't a one-on-one

00:36:23.08 yes yes there are and there are slacks there are messages to one another

00:36:27.18 okay I was gonna I'll I would let it slide I would I would have let it slide

00:36:32.06 if you didn't just try to absolve yourself of responsibility for this why

00:36:36.21 does somebody stop me sometimes like I don't touch

00:36:42.04 did we talk about this several times in those meetings like I feel like this has

00:36:46.18 been discussed three or four meetings at this point which is quite a while you

00:36:52.06 volunteered to like sign them that's my question

00:36:54.21 I remember being mad at Eric and you for trying to gaslight me because I was

00:36:58.17 supposed to do something with them that I didn't agree to but obviously they're

00:37:01.23 at my house so what am I supposed to do with them cause I'm gonna do it

00:37:05.14 I just don't know what to do that's why I bring it up aren't you supposed to

00:37:11.05 write like wrist pocket or whatever and then like sign it or like number it

00:37:15.19 I don't know if you have these ideas what do you want me to do no no hang on

00:37:21.16 hang on hang on what would you like me to do in the future Geoff okay here's

00:37:25.12 what I want you to do okay just just remember what it was I was supposed to

00:37:29.10 do with them I'm happy to do it well I'm

00:37:31.07 not happy to do it but I'm willing to do it I just don't remember what it is I

00:37:34.20 like how I'm supposed to manipulate these stupid things Eric you're getting

00:37:37.20 a nice glimpse as to what it was like to build stuff in mine craft with Geoff

00:37:41.23 based on his notes while he was an alcoholic

00:37:45.16 in mine craft at 50 trying to figure out what like double block

00:37:51.03 upside down means and try to make a game out of it

00:37:55.15 I just I just don't remember how I'm supposed to manipulate these stupid

00:37:59.02 things and I want to do it faithfully and properly they don't say anything on

00:38:02.07 them right they're just the pockets are they blank uh I think they have the

00:38:05.15 uniform logo on them okay yeah so you're

00:38:07.20 supposed to write the wrist pockets rock

00:38:09.21 or whatever yeah yeah whatever you wrote on your original thing that you cut out

00:38:13.20 from your [ __ ] jeans and just taped to your wrist oh which I which I still

00:38:17.14 have it's taped to my to my monitor

00:38:21.01 yeah when you get 30 in and you start getting lost uh just look back at that

00:38:26.04 original that's hanging from your monitor okay gal

00:38:28.23 I got it right here and then I guess you could sign it or number them you can do

00:38:32.11 whatever you like numbering sounds appropriate yeah I mean

00:38:36.05 that sounds good I mean either way you're writing all over them so you do

00:38:39.09 whatever you want I suppose um yeah I mean this is see here's the thing here's

00:38:44.09 the thing you're saying like oh what am I supposed to oh how do I get into this

00:38:48.01 whatever the thing that we haven't done yet that you keep talking about is

00:38:53.01 hitting all these [ __ I baseballs like well yeah because uh

00:38:57.11 well I don't know why we haven't done that yet

00:38:59.14 I'm ready to go I got like as soon as I'm done with quarantine I'm ready to go

00:39:03.01 Geoff booker Geoff [ __ ] you were supposed to throw a baseball 80 miles an

00:39:07.09 hour and now you're saying why haven't I hit one thousand possibles yet

00:39:10.23 well I think they only ordered 300 so I only have to hit 300. You're not going

00:39:16.04 to hit half of them well if I get a 50

00:39:18.19 percent contact ratio that's that's got to at least be like a a 300 batting

00:39:22.05 average I'm I'm in I'm like a young tony Gwynn

00:39:25.20 all right we'll schedule a day we'll schedule a day we I have there's a field

00:39:30.15 there's a field we can use we'll hit it into the back stop we'll toss them up

00:39:33.22 you can hit them with do you still want to dip a bat in oil or whatever you were

00:39:37.17 talking yeah and paint and paint so that we can sign them yeah

00:39:41.03 great yeah for sure yeah that's cool that's not gonna get paint's not gonna

00:39:44.19 go everywhere this will be good oh I assume it probably will but we'll have

00:39:47.22 Gavin film it I know the world doesn't work this way but I want the you know

00:39:51.07 how like you have a nerf gun or like a water gun how you have to like pump it

00:39:54.06 to increase the force on it I want a bat where you have to twist the doorknob at

00:39:58.21 the bottom to increase velocity I just want to see you like twisting the knob

00:40:04.10 but it's like gotta pump it up pellegon will have numbers on it let's go the way

00:40:10.08 around to 11 on the on the bottom yeah there's like a psi type gauge

00:40:15.11 I should only hit the balls with the hand with the handle bat

00:40:20.13 I'll have to build the handle bat prototype and then we can only hit the

00:40:24.22 balls with that

00:40:26.21 oh man that was the oh the one other thing I wanted to talk about is uh is

00:40:31.20 this I've been in this in well here are you guys familiar with this liquid death

00:40:36.03 scene the big game using witchcraft should I be watching this liquid death

00:40:41.20 which is like a water company has uh enlisted the help as a marketing

00:40:46.10 campaign enlisted the help of a uh magician or uh I don't know a bruja or

00:40:51.14 wizard or somebody to use magic to determine and influence the outcome of

00:40:56.15 the super bowl I will say from my experience it was not helpful

00:41:00.19 not the magic are you guys done with magic oh well I think in like a week

00:41:04.17 there will be it'll be announced who the offensive rookie of the year is a week

00:41:08.11 for us it will probably be out by the time you hear this uh yeah I'm assuming

00:41:13.14 but we'll find that out and from my understanding the list included

00:41:16.20 Geoff's rookie and gavin's rookie but not my rookie didn't even make the cut so

00:41:21.11 I'm a cool question unfortunately Justin fields no matter

00:41:25.20 what witchcraft or wizardry I threw at Justin fields nothing could overcome the

00:41:31.05 dark forces of Matt nagy uh which held us back but I'm hoping for one of you

00:41:35.20 two what kind of spells were you doing uh all sorts of I I'm it's not that's

00:41:40.09 beyond my understanding I just had I don't know I think the problem is you

00:41:44.23 were you were soliciting help from people I just did the actual spells and

00:41:48.19 incantations myself that might be the thing I need to change the only person I

00:41:52.14 don't want to win is Gavin yeah because you did nothing

00:41:56.12 you did nothing and you made fun of it the entire process of doing it it would

00:42:00.23 be the most you think I'm just putting up and it's a

00:42:04.09 it's not it's a shame because I like their water I do think it's actually

00:42:08.21 pretty good but uh I'm just putting up uh just throwing out there that uh

00:42:12.16 if we're gonna use magic again in the future to influence the outcome of

00:42:15.19 anything which I think we should because

00:42:17.18 I think we still have our wizards versus

00:42:19.12 magic idea for basketball and I do think that there's more room to grow in the

00:42:24.16 using magic to influence sporting events angle I think we kind of lost lost the

00:42:28.05 threat a little bit as we got distracted by other things on the podcast

00:42:31.05 uh I would like to revisit it sometime but I would also like to to raise the

00:42:34.14 idea that if we're going to use magic to

00:42:37.05 influence anything maybe it should be to get revenge on liquid death

00:42:40.14 like use magic to combat their magic to yeah to like get I don't know what to

00:42:44.22 figure it out maybe hex them I was looking at the super bowl halftime prop

00:42:48.20 bets for this year I'd like to throw some magic at that I'm really I'm trying

00:42:52.07 to I've been spending the last day trying to decide what color of gatorade

00:42:55.12 the winning coach is gonna get dumped over him it's two to one odds on orange

00:42:59.07 just a favorite but it's it's a tough hey if you

00:43:01.22 I know you're probably doing your prop bets from your phone but I'm gonna be in

00:43:03.20 Vegas for the super bowl uh so if you want me to play something oh that's

00:43:07.21 physically while I'm there I'll be happy let me know what they have I'd love to

00:43:11.05 hear yeah it's probably a more extensive

00:43:13.01 because it's like I'm gonna once again I think the greatest win I've ever had in

00:43:16.17 my career of gambling it's so dumb to call it a career I don't know why I said

00:43:21.05 that but the jlo picking what song Jayla would open with

00:43:24.18 when she was at the super bowl because that leaked all-time win the excitement

00:43:28.20 of hearing jenny from the block so I'm hoping to recreate that great halftime

00:43:32.18 show this year very excited very excited as well yeah let me know uh I mean th

00:43:36.18 this will come out uh this will already soon yeah it'll all be done okay so yeah

00:43:40.13 I'm staying at the wind so I'll be at the sports book in the win uh watching

00:43:43.16 the super bowl so I'll send you photos of all the prophets thank you

00:43:47.08 very very fun because the main one I gotta pick is like who will sing first

00:43:51.03 which I don't know I don't know who will perform first over unders on the anthem

00:43:54.23 who will the mvp mention first just a bunch of ridiculous ones but I'd love I

00:43:59.03 bet you this actual sports book has way more dumb options to pick from

00:44:04.06 absolutely okay that was my things I have one thing it's

00:44:06.23 a very uneventful week for me aside from something happened that I feel like

00:44:11.22 I'm almost confident in saying that this has never happened to anyone else on

00:44:16.15 earth okay there's some pictures some pictures

00:44:20.00 coming out oh I'm very excited so I was putting some stuff on my wall it's

00:44:24.01 putting some controllers up because I feel like I've got some nice uh yeah

00:44:27.11 those are pretty Jeremy does this too he's got like some nice limited edition

00:44:30.11 controllers that aren't necessarily in use because they're not elites or

00:44:33.12 whatever so display them on the wall and then I was wearing some sweatpants that

00:44:38.06 have these little toggle things that cover the end of you

00:44:42.00 know that cover like the plastic bit yeah a little plastic cap for the end of

00:44:46.12 your sweatpants wearing these sweatpants putting these things on the wall smee

00:44:50.13 was like swatting at the strings and uh I guess at some point he knocked one of

00:44:56.13 them off and down here you can see they look very similar to like the drywall

00:45:01.10 anchors oh my god so I posted one of those into my wall I'm not sure anyone

00:45:06.18 ever has ever done that do you think anyone

00:45:09.22 has accidentally pushed the cover from their sweatpants

00:45:14.04 into a hole they drilled in their own wall because I and he looked at smee

00:45:19.01 looked at me after I did this after I realized that it went straight in

00:45:22.01 instead of you know stopping in the war it just went and I heard it just rattled

00:45:25.23 down and fall into the floor of the war and then he just looked at me like he

00:45:29.11 meant to do it that's probably why you lost

00:45:32.06 at that power I just thought has that has that ever happened no you're the

00:45:36.08 only person like no one would come up with that

00:45:39.11 would they how old is earth hold on

00:45:42.10 of all the things in the in the correct order to happen they look similar

00:45:47.05 they're the similar size 0.543 billion years you are the only person

00:45:54.12 to have done that I would I would bet my life on it.

00:46:02.00 I I wish I was just filming the my own face just in the realization of just

00:46:07.03 like I'm really loving these little peaks into your your home life lately it's

00:46:12.23 been highly entertaining it's just nothing normal ever happens I I want a

00:46:17.22 normal experience for once I I'm trying to get more into

00:46:22.10 diy and it's a disaster and it's not like I'm being lazy or I just can't this

00:46:27.20 weird [ __ ] keeps happening the unknown it's never in the instructions oh

00:46:32.07 yeah I guess there's probably not a thing in your your door your doorknob

00:46:36.05 for explosions I bet that wasn't a covered section no what else I mean is

00:46:40.09 there anything or those the two main things I mean am I missing anything of

00:46:44.00 like diy gone wrong for you recently trying to remember uh cause you had the

00:46:47.15 the wasp nest in your fan but that wasn't really your fault or like a

00:46:51.11 design thing by you well he blew up his door handle he smashed snatched his

00:46:55.23 remote in half he didn't vacuum for a year and a half till we made him do it

00:47:00.02 on camera uh well I back in the carpet I just didn't

00:47:03.16 vacuum the little there was the the sideboard the cucumber incident

00:47:08.13 he threw he threw a route 44 across his house trying to repaint those are great

00:47:12.21 those are highlights those are great things that happened in the house

00:47:17.00 what's the most ambitious diy project you've taken on is this it you'd say

00:47:21.12 yeah it's pretty simple stuff I've done

00:47:23.10 some like wiring I drop [ __ ] in my walls a lot I'll be honest I'm not used to

00:47:27.14 having like big hollow walls with nothing in between that I had this this uh

00:47:31.23 thing that you could tie around the end of a wire it was like a magnet on the

00:47:35.12 outside of the wall you have like a magnetic roller so you roll it up the

00:47:39.09 wall and it sort of drags wires up or down on the inside of your walls

00:47:43.02 but I guess I was just unaware of where other wires are on the wall like to an

00:47:47.05 outlet there's wires going down the wall and then like coming out sideways and I

00:47:51.05 ended up tangling this freaking magnet thing and to the point where there's

00:47:54.22 still one inside my wall and I just sealed the hole up because I couldn't

00:47:58.00 get it out it's like there's a in one of

00:48:01.03 my walls there's a load of string with a magnet on the end wrapped around the

00:48:06.21 wire that feeds the outlet by that and it's just going to be in there

00:48:10.00 forever like the the the next house is he's going to find a lot of weird [ __ ]

00:48:14.23 in the walls I think based on how it's gone so far

00:48:18.12 it's like all those old American houses with like loose razor blades in the in

00:48:22.05 the bathroom walls oh yeah oh no that sounds terrible you don't know

00:48:26.02 about that Andrew no I've never heard of that yeah and bat in old bathrooms they

00:48:29.15 used to do that in an old medicine cabinet sometimes there'd be like a

00:48:33.05 little razor thing where you just like pop your razor and just go into the wall

00:48:36.12 forever what short-sighted thing ever it's like

00:48:40.00 it was like a staple inside of medicine cabinets there would just be a little

00:48:44.13 slit for you to just throw [ __ ] away inside your wall back in

00:48:48.02 the old days though I think like this is

00:48:49.23 that that [ __ ] was probably made like in the 1930s 1940s I think razer blades

00:48:54.15 lasted a whole lot longer back then they were made to to be more durable so you

00:48:58.20 probably weren't popping one a week in there it was probably more like one

00:49:02.10 every six months or something oh I thought it was like a weekly thing no

00:49:06.08 razor blades are that that's it's it's one of those scams like light bulbs

00:49:09.16 where razor blades are made to deteriorate and suck so that they so

00:49:12.12 that they're infinitely replaceable so they can sell it to you forever but you

00:49:15.17 can make a razor blade the last damn near forever I want to know the history

00:49:18.22 of that though because what is it just no you're not gonna look it up on Google

00:49:22.04 they got it they got it all anything you want to know the history on Google got

00:49:25.10 it do they yeah I just wanted like what was the conversation of did somebody say

00:49:30.12 well then where did this go and then just like I don't know but who cares

00:49:34.00 yeah there you go slot razor blade slot because they're sharp and dangerous and

00:49:37.13 you don't want to throw them in a trash can and then pick it up and get you cut

00:49:41.11 yourself oh that's [ __ ] there's another photo of is this the remains of

00:49:46.08 yeah that's what happens if you cut open like a certain aged American home

00:49:51.22 I really like the idea of of like a generation of people having their pile

00:49:55.19 exists like this is great grandpappy's razor it's like when the people like

00:50:00.00 core the ice and you can this is yeah six million years old that's like well

00:50:04.11 that's all granddad's racist so in the 1930s the worst wall to get

00:50:08.21 thrown through would be a bathroom wall if you're gonna go through a wall

00:50:14.12 that would be the worst one that scene in the matrix [Laughter]

00:50:18.23 cut them up I would I'd be so pissed if I got thrown through a wall and landed

00:50:24.06 on a razor pile if I was fighting somebody let's say I'm

00:50:30.00 in a fight to the death right I'm having a full-on brawl with somebody in a

00:50:34.21 bathroom if I threw them through the wall and they got they landed on a razor

00:50:39.10 pile I would call a timeout on their behalf because that's just unacceptable

00:50:44.21 I would feel so bad that would end the fight gotta call it a doctor

00:50:50.05 I'd throw in the bathroom towel just to end it immediately this cannot didn't

00:50:54.03 you did you ever live in a house Geoff that had one of those I assume so yeah I

00:50:58.13 mean I I I wanna say maybe the old house that we

00:51:01.21 lived in together in the downstairs bathroom might have had it but I I can't

00:51:06.00 remember specifically but I mean it's something that like the second you

00:51:09.12 mentioned it's so commonplace in my head I feel like I see it all the time

00:51:13.07 I would I would go so far to say any house that's 80 years old or older

00:51:17.03 probably that hasn't been completely renovated probably has one of these you

00:51:20.12 might be living in a home uh you dear regulation listener uh or comment leaver

00:51:25.12 uh you might be living in a home right now with a uh a hidden cache of razer

00:51:29.20 blades that you have no idea about go check out your bathroom and look at it

00:51:32.23 with a critical eye back when I had a yard I used to think about what is the

00:51:36.19 coolest thing buried in that yard that I just have no ideas there if there's

00:51:40.11 anything like if I were to dig up the entire yard how far would I have to go

00:51:43.18 before I found something and what what would that be are you just talking

00:51:47.11 straight down like I'm talking straight down on my if I just got a shovel and

00:51:51.18 was like I'm gonna spend the next 15

00:51:54.04 years whatever I feel like it's just digging holes in my backyard I mean

00:51:57.16 what's the coolest likely than not you'll probably find nothing right I'd

00:52:01.07 assume south no possibility my backyard is full of [ __ ]

00:52:05.06 really huh yeah like I don't know who the [ __ ] were that lived in

00:52:09.15 this house 40 years ago but they were straight up burying trash in the

00:52:15.12 backyard huh have you what's the coolest thing you

00:52:18.03 found nothing cool nothing cool at all but like digging to [ __ ] like put a

00:52:22.23 flower bed in or something you're like why is there half a milk jug buried

00:52:27.18 like what the [ __ ] and I'm constantly picking up like I think they were kind

00:52:33.22 of like Austin has this uh this eclectic vibe Andrew uh it's maybe not as

00:52:38.02 prevalent as it was as the with the influx of uh money and tech bros and

00:52:41.18 stuff but Austin used to pride itself on

00:52:43.18 like every you know everybody's backyard was like full of Christmas lights 24

00:52:47.23 hours a day or 365 days a year and you would have like these little weird

00:52:51.09 gardens of like found [ __ ] and like a lot of old wrought iron rusting it's all

00:52:54.23 cute there's like coffee shops like spider house which is closed now but

00:52:58.06 kind of pride themselves on it it's like it's weird it's like being in a salvage

00:53:01.12 yard that's a coffee shop I didn't know it closed yeah it did the the the place

00:53:04.22 next door to it that they operate is still open the ballroom but the coffee

00:53:09.07 shops closed real sad so the people there were definitely some

00:53:12.03 like hippie-ish people who lived in my yard my house at some point who would

00:53:16.15 just bury like you know those like glass rod like anything they had they were

00:53:21.11 like throw it in the backyard and it will make it it'll be a thing like I I

00:53:25.15 was cleaning up in the extreme back of my yard I was just cleaning up piles of

00:53:29.21 leaves and I like I touched on something that was like hard so I dug it out and

00:53:34.07 it was like a ceramic tile and I thought what a weird thing to be in the ground

00:53:37.16 and then I noticed there was it was budding up next to another one and I

00:53:41.08 pulled up 25 ceramic tiles somebody just

00:53:43.19 laid them in a pattern and said like hey it's a back deck now I put 25 ceramic

00:53:48.14 tiles on top of the ground yeah it's a deck and then eventually uh dirt and

00:53:53.09 ground cover that's it my backyard is full of that [ __ ] I'll

00:53:56.16 just be like I'll kick the ground and it'll hurt and I'll be like what the

00:53:59.18 [ __ ] and I'll dig out a brick like no no middle of the yard maybe if we go to

00:54:03.07 your yard to dig the bean hole we'll find some really cool [ __ ] can we make a

00:54:07.07 [ __ ] bean hole fine let's finally do it let's figure out like fine

00:54:10.22 2022 is the the year of the bean hole what's this idea predates face all

00:54:15.22 together do you want to explain it Geoff yeah uh I got really into bean holes a

00:54:20.15 couple years [ __ ] over a decade ago at this point because I read an article in

00:54:24.16 the new york times about it and what it is Andrew is it was started by loggers

00:54:29.16 up in the northeast like in the main Vermont area what they would do is they

00:54:34.12 had to feed all the loggers and they were moving campsites like

00:54:38.23 every two days going further and further up into the extreme north and so the

00:54:43.02 chef the cook would have to travel ahead of them and prepare food and have the

00:54:47.03 food ready for them when they got there so they developed this ingenious idea

00:54:51.06 where they would dig a hole in the ground right and then they would take a

00:54:56.12 big ass like cast iron pot and they would fill it with beans and then like a

00:55:00.12 ham hock and tomatoes and onions and just everything you would want like some

00:55:05.01 yummy ass baked beans right this crazy recipe and then they would close it up

00:55:09.16 right put the top on the on the big cast iron stick it in the hole about four

00:55:13.16 feet in the ground maybe and then they would burn a bunch of wood and then they

00:55:17.18 would get all the hot uh essentially the hot coals and they would cover the bean

00:55:22.05 hole or they would cover the the the cast iron bean container with all these

00:55:25.23 hot embers right and then they would stick like a piece of plywood over that

00:55:30.17 and then cover it with like a foot of dirt and then

00:55:33.22 48 hours later when the lagers would come up they would knock off the dirt

00:55:38.18 pick up the thing pull out the bean hole

00:55:40.19 and they would have the greatest tasting beans on earth in this giant pot that

00:55:45.12 they could all eat communally for like two days and then uh at that point then

00:55:49.14 the chef would go up two days further and then make another bean hole and so

00:55:55.03 uh every from everything that I've read uh in my extensive bean hole research

00:56:00.08 there is nothing on earth like bean whole beans there is nothing on earth

00:56:04.15 like 48 hour prepared bean hole beans and when I was in the army and we fought

00:56:09.14 forest fires in Montana one of the things that they did was they would give

00:56:13.07 us these these solar lunch bags that would have like a burrito in it and it

00:56:17.05 would be wrapped in in uh like tin foil and the instructions were to find some

00:56:21.23 hot ash on the ground that had burned and then kick a hole stick it in and

00:56:25.23 then cover it with the ashes and come back in like 20 minutes you'd have a

00:56:29.07 cooked burrito and ever since then I thought that was the coolest idea uh

00:56:32.18 just microwave yeah microwave so when I discovered the bean hole I've been I've

00:56:35.23 been obsessed with the idea of making a bean hole forever and we've been talking

00:56:39.20 about it forever and I really want to do it I just haven't done it yeah you

00:56:43.08 absolutely need to do that I explained this whole thing to Eric

00:56:46.16 barr recently oh dude really yeah I would like to think that the inventor of

00:56:50.16 the bean hole also invented the razer blade slot like the concept of like this

00:56:55.00 is his follow-up like he brought on shark tank let me everybody knows the

00:56:59.12 success I've had with the razer blade slot I got the newest innovation okay

00:57:03.09 we're not done putting things in a hole and then just forgetting about them for

00:57:07.05 a while this is the bean hole you will never

00:57:10.05 have beans better than when you put them in a hole do yourself a favor and after

00:57:14.12 this episode's over at some point throughout the course of your day when

00:58:05.07 fingerprint door handle I could have just turned my door handle upside down

00:58:08.20 my door handles already work both ways I'm not sure if that's a variation but I

00:58:13.04 can turn my handles up to open the door as well so I'm not flipping upside down

00:58:16.12 I don't think would do anything money bags over here with the ambidextrous

00:58:19.22 door handles look at you high class I mean they're on the doors already when I

00:58:24.10 moved but sure very very very very subtle brag Gavin but we all got [Laughter]
