00:00:49.16 I would love to see if the if a tortilla in Canada tastes similar to a tortilla

00:00:55.09 in Texas or they if they are the exact same thing

00:00:59.06 or two wildly different things like when Gavin and I had Mexican food in Norway.

00:01:04.19 I don't even know how to describe it wasn't that the Netherlands yeah I'm

00:01:09.16 sorry the Netherlands there's the Netherlands there's umbrella

00:01:12.20 I don't think I've been to Norway yeah it was I don't think I have either

00:01:16.09 actually but if I do go it's gonna be with you and it's gonna be to eat

00:01:21.16 Mexican food what are we gonna do a whole series

00:01:24.23 about bad Mexican food called Mexican yeah where we travel [Laughter]

00:01:30.02 we were gonna call it Mexican or the worst Mexican restaurants on earth yeah

00:01:34.12 that would be up there that would be uh well it's definitely my top three worst

00:01:38.01 Mexican food it's just a lot of [ __ ] which is the show I

00:01:42.03 feel like the core of that show is just a show it's a lot of Geoff [ __ ]

00:01:46.23 and unfortunate wise yeah we I got a burrito at that place because

00:01:50.23 it's like you gotta like what's safer than a burrito not much right uh and

00:01:55.04 they had chickpeas in it I remember that I was very confused by that and I want

00:01:59.12 to say it is a burrito with chickpeas which

00:02:03.01 don't exist in burrito form ever and I want to say it had celery as well it was

00:02:07.12 [ __ ] bizarre you think a burrito is safer than a quesadilla no I would say

00:02:12.02 the quesadilla is safer I would say the quesadilla is the safest Mexican food I

00:02:16.00 would say quesadilla is safer but I don't think it's as universally uh

00:02:19.12 available really on the menu yeah I don't think that was I don't

00:02:23.10 think they've ever heard of a quesadilla in the Netherlands no I don't think so

00:02:27.05 huh that's interesting have you ever wondered like what what is the best

00:02:31.22 restaurant that a different country has of a different country's cuisine like oh

00:02:37.07 what's the best Italian restaurant in china um right right or like like how

00:02:43.09 the Indian food in London is so [ __ ]

00:02:46.12 good in my experience really yeah what would be the very best

00:02:51.11 of the yeah or like the Thai food in Australia oh my god so good there I

00:02:55.10 remember Anthony bourdain said that like the worst place to get a place's staple

00:03:00.19 food is that place like the Philadelphia is the worst place

00:03:03.20 to get a cheese steak like it's just shitty like the they're surrounding

00:03:07.17 areas that are way better type deal I don't know Italian food in Italy is

00:03:11.07 pretty damn great yeah I feel like that's a tough one I'm not I'm not I'm

00:03:15.02 gonna I'm gonna I'm comfortable taking on the Philly cheese steak I'm not gonna

00:03:19.09 take on Italian food as a whole in Italy that's too big I don't know man

00:03:23.14 the best Philly cheesesteaks I've ever had have definitely come from Philly

00:03:27.11 where have you gotten Philly cheesesteaks from outside of Philly is

00:03:32.00 this something you've explored quiznos I mean I'm I'm 46 so probably like

00:03:36.18 only a hundred thousand times throughout my life I would say a Philly

00:03:39.19 cheesesteak's been more of a staple to my life uh than a quesadilla really

00:03:44.07 oh I would not disagree I don't think I've ever had a Philly cheese steak I've

00:03:48.02 had a lot of quesadillas I like that you disagreed with Geoff's own experience

00:03:52.17 yeah I did well no he said I thought he was making

00:03:56.06 a general opinion on like what is more what is wider I thought he was talking

00:04:00.15 about his actual life whether where the uh Philly cheese steak was the

00:04:05.12 biggest staple you're like I disagree I disagree

00:04:08.01 well there are sometimes you know things and you don't even know you know them

00:04:12.11 that's the thing that's happened recently I don't know if we want to go

00:04:16.12 into that story I had Gavin and I were talking about a thing

00:04:20.04 and I knew a piece of information that I didn't know that I knew and I

00:04:24.00 accidentally said the thing I really had

00:04:26.13 the most bizarrely circular conversation that ended up with us just like leaving

00:04:31.18 the party chat and uh separate ways real quick hello and welcome to another

00:04:36.15 episode of the F**kFuckFacePodcast my name is Geoff Ramsey with me as always

00:04:42.06 uh Andrew panton and Gavin free in that order uh take it away circular

00:04:47.18 conversations we were well why don't we let's open this with the same

00:04:51.23 conversation we started with Gavin I don't know if you've had this talk have

00:04:55.03 you had this talk with Geoff have you asked him this piece of trivia well no

00:04:58.22 if it's not on camera he hasn't but you have to go back a little bit further

00:05:02.04 than that because you just randomly asked me do you have any movie

00:05:05.05 recommendations okay so I thought well you've seen a lot of

00:05:09.03 you've seen a lot of stuff so I thought what is something like what's the movie

00:05:13.16 that I like that maybe not a lot of people I know have seen and I came up

00:05:17.04 with a fish called Wanda which I haven't movie haven't seen good movie

00:05:21.17 good sequel heavenly creatures as well fierce creatures the the uh fierce

00:05:25.20 creatures yeah that got us onto the conversation of the man the legend uh

00:05:30.11 Kevin klein I was saying like I don't I what was my

00:05:34.01 point I think it was like I don't see him in anything anymore like I

00:05:38.09 yeah I don't feel like I just see him in things and I'm sure he's in a lot yeah

00:05:42.11 he I feel like he he's known for just turning down so much

00:05:45.20 stuff oh really but I think that I think

00:05:49.09 I mean the most recent stuff he's in his um he's mr fischoeder in bob's burgers

00:05:53.14 yes um which is current but then I was telling Andrew about this

00:05:57.15 weird piece of trivia that I once read but I actually misquoted but you know

00:06:01.19 it's along the same lines in that okay what I said to Andrew was that he is one

00:06:07.11 of the few actors who has played two different roles in the same movie

00:06:11.12 where one at one point in the movie one character has to impersonate the other

00:06:15.21 did that connect with you Geoff because I

00:06:17.20 I was very confused by this originally I

00:06:20.01 didn't understand the piece of trivia he

00:06:22.00 he's playing two different characters in

00:06:24.01 a movie and one of the characters has to impersonate the other character that

00:06:27.22 he's impersonating yeah I was pulling from uh wild wild west where he plays you

00:06:33.11 know the guy and then he also plays the president and then at some point his

00:06:37.06 character impersonates the president and then I was also thinking of fierce

00:06:42.17 creatures where he plays the Australian billionaire rod mccain

00:06:46.17 and also he plays his son Vince mccain and at one point in the movie he Vince

00:06:50.19 mccain has to pretend to be rod mccain so I was like how many times has this

00:06:54.03 guy done this but that wasn't even the interesting part of the trivia that was

00:06:57.07 wrong he is one of the few actors who has played a character and the president

00:07:02.11 where the other character impersonates the

00:07:06.05 president in two different movies so I was just thinking it was those two

00:07:09.22 movies but it was actually specifically the president because in a movie called

00:07:13.15 Dave yeah he was in Dave he also played himself and the president and then

00:07:17.12 impersonate the president so I was just like how many times has this guy played

00:07:21.12 two characters where one character in person is the other it's like a really

00:07:25.18 specific thing who else has done that it's a very special skill he has

00:07:30.01 it is a weird thing to be known for so I pondered for a little bit and I was

00:07:33.05 thinking about it and then I told Gavin peter stormeir did it in a movie called

00:07:37.06 splice play two characters one of those characters pretended to be another

00:07:41.14 character Gavin was impressed by this because I don't think he had ever heard

00:07:45.08 anyone reply with an actual answer to it

00:07:47.16 to which I then revealed that I made all of that up because peter storm air

00:07:52.21 has a career that you can't really fully

00:07:55.20 track splice is just a movie that I like I didn't think Gavin would have seen

00:07:58.21 that was also kind of obscure I just lied about it I made up this fact and I

00:08:00.21 was living because I was I was listening to him go on about this movie for you

00:08:04.22 know a few minutes while we're playing halo and I was like oh interest you know

00:08:08.13 I'm thinking like maybe I want to check that out and then eventually just like

00:08:12.13 yeah I was just lying I just made it up I couldn't think of

00:08:16.16 I couldn't think of one and it was a whole it was whole issue so then do we

00:08:21.22 jump forward now to later completely different conversation

00:08:26.11 probably over an hour later an hour had passed I was talking about how in last

00:08:30.17 week's podcast I flubbed uh my Chris where I said Chris rock instead of Chris

00:08:35.04 tucker and then we were talking and then you were talking to me about Chris rock

00:08:38.15 movies no I was talking to you about Jackie we were ranking Jackie chan

00:08:42.23 sidekicks well that was the conversation

00:08:45.08 yes who is like the greatest Jackie chan sidekick of all time I feel like Chris

00:08:49.01 tucker probably but he's had some great sidekicks too then I then started

00:08:53.03 talking I started talking about a movie called bad company uh which I was like

00:08:57.03 ah that kind of feels like it should have been a Jackie chan movie china are

00:09:02.04 you familiar with bad company Geoff I don't think so it is an early bill

00:09:07.14 2000's Chris rock action comedy with Chris rock and Anthony Hopkins where

00:09:13.03 Chris rock plays a secret agent who is deep undercover dies

00:09:17.04 and then they recruit his twin brother who is completely unrelated like doesn't

00:09:21.23 he's kind of like a street hustler in my memory could be wrong but he's not like

00:09:25.23 a trained agent to then take over the role of his brother who is undercover so

00:09:30.21 they can continue their operation I said all of this he was telling me

00:09:35.14 this and I was like wait so you're saying

00:09:38.23 Chris rock plays two characters and then

00:09:41.16 one character impersonates the other and

00:09:45.01 I I had accidentally given the answer to the piece of trivia I had an answer I

00:09:48.19 just didn't know I had it I knew it but I didn't know I knew it and that took us

00:09:52.01 to the to the next stage of this we thought that was pretty that was pretty

00:09:56.19 funny accidental full circle I look up the movie bad company on imdb

00:10:02.23 third build actor peter storm air

00:10:05.20 chances that he accidentally provides the answer

00:10:09.01 to the question and in his answer is the same [ __ ] answer from before it was

00:10:14.23 we were just like this is just too creepy it's gonna it's gone around

00:10:19.06 and with all the halo in between it just felt mental we just had to like come

00:10:23.12 offline be like what the hell what just happened

00:10:26.14 that's that kind of thing happens way too many [ __ ] times to be coincidence

00:10:30.15 that's really weird it was weird and it has been a problem where ever since I

00:10:35.20 have lied about peter stormeir peter stormer is following me everything I

00:10:39.22 want turns out uh he's in the tuxedo that's the thing he's in he's in that as

00:10:44.10 well I was playing fast and furious last night the video game the most recent

00:10:48.05 video game that came out [ __ ] peter storm air is the main villain he's just

00:10:52.17 in it he's just showing up left and right my life now I can't avoid peter

00:10:57.22 snore mayor since I made a random fake fact about he's following me hey you

00:11:03.18 know what I have one oh what's yours okay uh why did you say it like that no no

00:11:08.16 no no you're excited no no no no no that was like that was like

00:11:12.16 like what's yours because I eventually came up with one no that was enthusiasm

00:11:15.22 wait who went uh Gavin did you get Andrew you seemed very

00:11:19.05 enthusiastic okay I'm sorry I misunderstood I thought you

00:11:21.16 misunderstood yeah no no it's very no you wouldn't go for it it gave me that

00:11:26.00 it's just clear I think it's just like I opened my I opened my mouth and Gavin

00:11:31.07 goes they were unrelated they weren't really

00:11:34.08 advised it's like you're like my first two wives buddy okay here we go

00:11:38.21 in the movie beer fest okay the guy that plays landfill dot he has I believe he

00:11:44.12 dies by drinking a vat of beer to save all their lives or something uh-huh and

00:11:49.12 then so that guy he's the farva from starship trooper or not start from super

00:11:53.20 cheaters uh starship troopers super troopers would be a great match up by the

00:11:58.12 way I'd love to see yeah starship super whatever it is uh anyway

00:12:02.19 that guy landfill he [ __ ] dies I think by drinking a like a vat of beer

00:12:07.15 and then his cousin shows up gill who happens to look exactly like him for the

00:12:12.11 funeral and then says I'd like to join your group and for the rest of the movie

00:12:16.15 in his honor will you just call me landfill and they're like absolutely so

00:12:20.09 he he plays a character who dies whose identical twin cousin shows up and plays

00:12:25.12 him also in twin peaks I'm pretty sure Cheryl lee

00:12:30.19 plays herself at 35 different [ __ ]

00:12:33.23 ways including impersonating was that it

00:12:35.17 was the cousin mad die or something plays Laura pogba at some point mad die Palmer

00:12:41.12 yeah so Cheryl lee plays Laura Palmer then she plays mad die Palmer her cousin

00:12:45.23 who shows up who then impersonates Laura Palmer to help try to solve the mystery

00:12:50.19 if you killed Laura Palmer so it's been done a lot yeah yeah

00:12:53.14 parent trap yeah there's a lot of there's a lot of times it's been done

00:12:56.18 but I I don't think anyone else has done it twice and also the president

00:13:00.19 it's one of my favorite things now to just text Gavin random movies in which

00:13:04.23 it occurs because he said it like I don't think it has ever happened a

00:13:10.02 single time outside of this like never mind twice

00:13:12.09 it's never happened once ocean's 12 was mine last night Julia Roberts character

00:13:18.08 in ocean's 12 then also Julia Roberts the celebrity exists and part of the

00:13:21.23 movie is Julia Roberts the character impersonating Julia Roberts the actor

00:13:27.00 how would that how does that even work because surely her entire life she must

00:13:30.23 have thought damn I look like oh my god dude

00:13:33.07 I just watched a movie I just watched a movie that is the whole [ __ ] this is

00:13:37.13 the whole point of it have you guys seen

00:13:39.07 the princess switch with Vanessa hudgins on Netflix

00:13:43.05 I was watching Christmas movies I watched the

00:13:45.05 I was watching the princess switch not the best movie in the world but the

00:13:48.23 whole point of it is she's like a baker from Chicago who goes to this fake ass

00:13:54.17 country to fill in a baking competition meets a princess who nobody's ever seen

00:13:58.17 they look exactly alike each other so they switch places so the princess

00:14:02.20 can for some reason live in the normal world but then they have to impersonate

00:14:06.08 each other again and then there's a sequel where they have to re-impersonate

00:14:09.20 each other and then another one where there's a [ __ ] cousin that shows up

00:14:12.20 and there's three of them that are all impersonating each other

00:14:16.12 this might be the most overused plot device in the history of plot devices it

00:14:21.20 sounds like it I don't this doesn't seem like this is just a thing that occurs

00:14:27.22 and not like an actual piece of trivia it's like

00:14:32.08 it's like here's the trivia fact it rained here can you name another place

00:14:37.05 in which it has rained I don't know if you can come up with it like it's just

00:14:41.13 yeah.

00:14:43.18 I will say Geoff if you're looking for another princess movie princess

00:14:47.18 protection program great movie great princess movie oh what's that on great

00:14:52.13 uh it's Disney plus it's a Disney original channel cousin Greg is in it a

00:14:56.00 teenage cousin Greg from succession very good oh my god dude cuz

00:15:00.10 cousin Greg has been phenomenal this season on succession uh by the way

00:15:03.11 speaking of movies you know I don't watch them uh but I did recently uh I

00:15:07.20 fell off my don't watch in movies uh horse and I watched one and it was

00:15:11.22 really [ __ ] good what do you want to say

00:15:14.18 I watched home sweet see there you go [Laughter]

00:15:17.09 I watched I watched home sweet home alone with uh Ellie kemper and rob

00:15:21.14 Delaney it was really [ __ ] good yeah the the home alone sequel interest or

00:15:25.21 reboot whatever you want to call it what's great it's a new home alone you

00:15:29.00 didn't know that there's a new home alone no yeah it's on it's on Disney

00:15:33.14 plus I was a little little British kid Gavin storm air in it no he's not

00:15:38.21 Pete 2007 he would have been peter stormer isn't in it but uh Pete Holmes

00:15:43.18 is who is a in every way a lesser version of that other man

00:15:47.16 do you like it because I feel like literally every other opinion I've heard

00:15:51.15 about that movie is it's the worst film that's ever been made that's ridiculous

00:15:55.18 it's not I mean you're never going to touch the first

00:15:58.21 two but it was it was good it was heartfelt it was funny there was some

00:16:04.02 legitimately not as funny as the first Keenan

00:16:06.12 thompson's okay in it he's uh he he plays like a real estate agent Chris

00:16:10.21 I wish he I wish he was in it more Chris parnell barely in it Keenan thompson's

00:16:14.14 in a little bit more I wish to god because keenan's such a funny dude I

00:16:18.08 wish they would have used him more but still it's good man so is it in the same

00:16:22.04 universe as like is it something related to Kevin McAllister yes it is in the

00:16:26.20 Kevin McAllister universe really I don't want to spoil I don't want to spoil

00:16:32.04 cameos and stuff but there are there are

00:16:34.01 definite overt cameos that make sense in the context of the film and there are

00:16:38.20 characters that appear I'm going to watch this movie I am also going to

00:16:43.01 watch this maybe next time we'll have opinions homeland one and two great

00:16:46.08 movies fantastic movies fantastic movies great movies I'm I'm excited to hear

00:16:51.12 that this is in the mcalester universe because in the trailer the mcu and the.

00:16:59.03 [Laughter]

00:17:02.08 Um it looked like they took a bunch of the

00:17:06.04 gags from the first and like a few of the other movies and just put them all

00:17:09.17 into one thing so I'm happy that it's it's a continuation in some way I think

00:17:13.21 there's also another home alone coming out with Ryan Reynolds at some point oh

00:17:17.13 really they announced that but it's like an adult like stuck at home in high but

00:17:21.21 dealing with robbers but I could be misremembering that that could have been

00:17:26.19 a fever dream I'll say this they did something very smart in the movie um and

00:17:31.20 I don't think it's spoiling too much but uh the the s the I don't think the kid

00:17:36.08 like it's hard to find another mccully culkin right like he was a

00:17:40.23 he was perfect for that role absolutely and

00:17:43.01 I really hard for anybody to to live up to to that role and so they make it it's

00:17:47.23 less focused on the kid and more a little bit more focused on the the

00:17:52.06 people breaking in uh to the house and I think that was a very smart choice

00:17:58.00 I like it I will check that out we're to watch another movie as well your movie

00:18:03.05 streak is far from done I cannot wait for us to record our tuxedo watch which

00:18:07.23 at some point will happen hopefully soon very excited we're going

00:18:11.15 to put it up right yeah no absolutely oh I'm back Gavin was gone you were gone I

00:18:15.22 was my thing freaked out for a second were you talking about tuxedo

00:18:19.14 yes I'm saying that we're gonna do a thing for it I'm excited for it adding

00:18:23.15 to Geoff's movie list well Henry's Henry got a new football and he loves it

00:18:29.01 speaking of stuff we're gonna do people loving the uh next time on face from

00:18:34.01 minor league fan jack yeah oh did a great job I ran into him today

00:18:38.00 at work uh did congratulated him it did a really good job I think we should do

00:18:42.02 it every week okay sure we can do it we'll see how let's see how long that

00:18:46.19 lasts it'll be until we stop being one ahead that yeah it'll go on the pile of

00:18:52.03 forgotten comedy like uh the smashing sportsman and ping pong balls and who

00:18:57.00 knows whatever [ __ ] baskets no I did the baskets that's part of the

00:19:00.08 redemption here how dare you I throw that in as an unsolved or unresolved

00:19:04.19 issue of our people what's your potential uh redemption year redo Andrew

00:19:09.01 that you mentioned I heard I heard about

00:19:11.06 the jacks so I I was aware that the jack thing had happened I'd seen some

00:19:15.09 comments about it or at least I thought I did

00:19:18.02 and so I was like oh I'll listen to it so I assumed it would be and we've had

00:19:21.14 several talks about this there's no excuse to this but I didn't know where

00:19:25.05 it was I assumed it would be at the start of the episode so I listened to

00:19:28.20 the beginning of the episode and as it's

00:19:30.20 this is known I don't listen to our show because I hate myself too much to do so

00:19:35.09 anything I listen to our show while we're making it no yeah it's true it's true

00:19:41.13 I I so I watched the beginning of it or listened to it and uh it's not there so

00:19:45.19 I'm like okay I'll comb to the end go to the end of it it's not there as well I

00:19:50.01 don't know where it is it's definitely in there somewhere but on top of that I

00:19:54.16 didn't know we had outro music that blew

00:19:56.22 my mind that was genuinely shocking last night to hear outro music come in I was

00:20:00.21 surprised I learned last night that this

00:20:02.21 show has outdoor music same as the intro music but it's there didn't know it was

00:20:08.04 there we've done this at one time yeah I was

00:20:11.03 trying to figure out what episode it was this is 81 we're recording what yeah it

00:20:14.16 took 81 times for me to realize that there's an outro we do an outro song and

00:20:18.15 we fade out and then I guess it's a gag sometimes

00:20:21.17 it's great this is a good job on the edit nick's a great editor he's he's

00:20:25.16 created and sometimes like the outro music will

00:20:28.12 stop in the middle if for some reason don't end it or just continue I think

00:20:32.20 that's maybe what happened in that episode which is why I missed the jack

00:20:36.03 thing is that correct that like it looked like we're gonna end and it goes

00:20:39.03 to the jack and then we continue beyond the jack nick wanted to put the jack

00:20:42.23 thing at the moment where we discussed it this time okay and then going forward

00:20:48.01 it'll be at the end I think okay well I'll find the jack at some point I'm

00:20:51.23 excited a few minutes for now it's an hour it's an hour and seven minutes in I

00:20:57.01 think okay well thank you that that results

00:20:59.05 awesome have we explained what we're talking about at any point during this

00:21:02.16 conversation uh well we're just assuming that they've yeah we're assuming that

00:21:06.10 everyone who's listened to this has listened to that one as well we should

00:21:09.12 recap it for us every week we're gonna try and get jack to read the discord

00:21:14.04 chat that we that happens while we record and then we put that

00:21:17.12 we we have jack figure out what we talked about and then put that recording

00:21:22.13 of jack explaining it on the previous episode at the end that's a little

00:21:26.04 teaser can I do some more more cleanup work right here like just just call

00:22:07.11 I'm gonna text my friends it just makes me laugh it's a great it's

00:22:10.11 one of the funniest videos I've seen in a long time I meant to bring it up at

00:22:14.01 the time where people could see it we didn't do that we just brushed past it

00:22:17.10 so if we're calling things out from the past explaining things go to the

00:22:21.09 Instagram to see that great video yeah see the uh me it was right after my

00:22:25.12 colonoscopy uh I have zero memory of this uh it's a pretty short video about a

00:22:29.18 minute long uh so while we're cleaning stuff up I have

00:22:33.00 a couple things I wanted to go over the real brief but while we're cleaning

00:22:36.17 stuff up and because it's probably still

00:22:39.05 December uh at this point I feel like we need to mention there is a plethora of

00:26:04.02 begin next week Andrew I want to hear you eat this thing

00:26:06.19 I don't want to hear it I was reading uh some comments today from from uh not

00:26:11.04 regulation listeners obviously comment leavers uh who were mentioning how much

00:26:14.21 they love it when we eat on camera so uh

00:26:17.14 however I think we should end on it like a big thing uh what so what

00:26:23.11 oh I've done it again.

00:26:28.11 [Music]

00:26:36.10 That was your fault you said you said you want me to do it

00:26:41.16 and you wanted to be allowed so I took a big bite into the microphone

00:26:48.12 this is a delicious apple Eric has a problem with what just

00:26:52.13 happened Eric I was just a great apple I don't understand you're I I want I want

00:26:57.07 you to be able to review the apple and everything I don't understand whose

00:27:00.14 fault is this oh it's just fall because he said I want you to his exact words

00:27:04.17 were I want you to eat the apple and I want it to be loud so I immediately

00:27:09.11 accommodated his request hey did you guys hear that at all when he took a bite

00:27:13.20 did you guys hear a bite did you guys hear a bite or were you just surprised

00:27:17.09 when he wasn't chewing his back okay cool just make it sure thank you

00:27:23.12 what people said about us eating on mike they love it more more please

00:27:30.10 somebody was like I swear to god every time I tune into an rt podcast no matter

00:27:36.01 what it is somebody's eating and it's driving and they hated it and I just

00:27:39.03 thought that was funny talking about food a lot this is a tart wait well

00:27:42.18 listen we're talking one of the things I

00:27:44.19 wanted to do was talk about a little bit

00:27:47.16 more food but right now I I really think Andrew should just go this is a tart

00:27:50.23 apple this is a tart apple this is a pretty apple this is a big apple

00:27:55.14 very crisp not chewy sweet this is a very good apple how juicy is

00:28:01.09 it uh I wouldn't I I wouldn't say it's too juicy it's like I'd say it's pretty

00:28:06.18 average on on the juice scale was it juice was your guys's apple juicy yeah I

00:28:10.20 choose still over my shorts yeah I was surprised at how juicy it was

00:28:15.05 I thought that was one of the defining characteristics of it was was the juice

00:28:18.23 mine wasn't mine's not very juicy it was very it's crisp there's a crispness to

00:28:24.04 it it bit really well it wasn't chewy I hate a chewy apple I

00:28:28.21 hate it as well it bit well there's a bite test too there's a bite feel the

00:28:33.18 apples Gavin it bit well it broke away from the core

00:28:36.05 in a way that was satisfying and not mushy you hate a mushy app I personally

00:28:40.17 like [ __ ] can't stand a mushy app what's your sticker look like what's

00:28:45.05 your code um my

00:28:50.10 you didn't eat the sticker did you no um

00:28:55.07 okay well we can review the apple at the end of the show

00:28:59.01 you in the wrong what are you doing what happened

00:29:03.07 you ate the wrong apple uh it's a I'm eating a pink lady apparently what the

00:29:08.23 [ __ ] what is

00:29:18.17 wait no I have a cousin Chris I must I put there must have been a pink lady

00:29:23.16 amongst the pile of the crisps and I it was in the bag what's up

00:29:27.22 there was a I do have a cosmic crisp though that I haven't been into we can

00:29:33.12 make that be the finale like you said Geoff everything that was an apple

00:29:38.11 switcheroo it was I I

00:29:42.04 hey now we know now we know a couple of things right for

00:29:46.19 we know we got the pink lady review we know pink lady is among andrew's

00:29:51.12 favorite apples because it was even in the house yep he's revealed two of his

00:29:55.22 favorites yeah and we can have it as a baseline to

00:30:00.01 compare uh his reaction to the cosmic crisp and by the way I'm glad it wasn't a

00:30:04.04 cosmic crisp because I was [ __ ]

00:30:06.15 confused when you said it wasn't juicy because that felt like a very different

00:30:10.15 apple than what we had I am stunned right now how did you do you saw what

00:30:14.06 the cosmic crisp look like they look similar I just I went in I grabbed a bag

00:30:18.22 of apples from my fridge and there's a pink lady I don't know how many I need

00:30:22.23 to check are you saying that was f all of your

00:30:26.00 apples are mixed together or did you accidentally buy a pink lady amongst the

00:30:30.02 cosmos no no no no no no I think I accidentally bought a pink lady amongst

00:30:34.02 the cosmic crisps I think there must have been a pink I'd

00:30:38.04 somehow grabbed the pink lady it must have sounds like you stole a pink lady

00:30:42.13 or I paid or you paid cosmic crispy yeah I think I paid cosmic Chris pricing for

00:30:48.04 it for a pink lady gonna mess up this stuff how do I take a photo that now

00:30:51.19 they're apple stocks off by one yeah you're how did that happen

00:30:56.12 I'm still blown away that you were eating a different

00:31:00.14 also thank god we asked about the sticker otherwise that we'd never know

00:31:04.22 you'd be living alive for the rest of your life imagine if he was eating the

00:31:08.07 hundred percent cocoa oh so sorry I was eating ice cream I didn't

00:31:12.19 we would have eventually learned when I flipped the apple I just bit into the

00:31:17.18 apple on the opposite of the sticker side you just are so keen to start eating

00:31:22.05 before we're ready that you didn't even look at the apple so see that's I ate

00:31:27.16 that half of the apple and I flipped it over

00:31:30.01 and it's just pink later oh yeah 41.30

00:31:33.05 what the [ __ ]

00:31:34.09 Gavin it would be like if we found out all these years that he's hated bananas

00:31:39.03 he was eating lemons and he's like what they're both yellow

00:31:42.05 they're essentially the same thing if we didn't make the joke about which

00:31:47.03 like batch number he had he went that's rough he would have just had a plan

00:31:51.10 I eventually when I flipped the apple I think I would have noticed but it's just

00:31:54.17 when would I have flipped the apple eric's commenting about my large bites I

00:31:59.00 was trying to make noise I wanted noise for the Geoff wanted it loud I was trying

00:32:04.19 to make the loudest crunch I could make I did well you

00:32:08.02 you made something all right Jesus okay so well yeah I will have the cosmic

00:32:13.07 crisp later I guess it's the finale like Geoff wants we'll just do it Geoff

00:32:19.01 we'll eat the other one later it's fine oh Christ oh my god oh god [Applause]

00:34:13.04 now I'm allowed to laugh at it okay of course yeah

00:34:16.23 Wednesday night last week right like night before thanksgiving uh

00:34:21.22 the girlfriend and I go to the storage facility

00:34:25.16 to get um Christmas decorations and stuff you know uh of which there is an

00:34:29.17 entire storage facility full of my girlfriend is very [ __ ] festive uh

00:34:33.16 and I mean that in a good way that sound I feel realize that sounded biting but

00:34:37.05 that's not how I mean and she also listens and I love I love

00:34:40.13 it I'm eating I'm eating my burnt pop-tart off of a Christmas plate right

00:34:44.13 now and I'm joyous to be doing so uh anyway so we go

00:34:49.02 and we load up uh these the two carts full of like tupperware's full of

00:34:53.04 [ __ ] you know like rubber maid bins full of ornaments and [ __ ] and I'm I

00:34:57.08 push out the elevator go out to sliding like the opening you know double open

00:35:02.15 doors and I'm putting stuff in the trunk of the car and I uh

00:35:05.14 I realized she's not behind me and I turn around and she's still not behind

00:35:08.13 me and I think that's weird we were in the elevator together

00:35:11.14 so I run back inside and she's just like standing in the middle of the elevator

00:35:16.03 half out with like the cart half in and a half out bent over and the doors just

00:35:20.06 keep like hitting the [ __ ] cart and her a little bit and she's just like I

00:35:24.06 thought she was confused or nauseous or like maybe she'd

00:35:28.08 thrown up or like I don't know what was going on

00:35:31.22 and but her body language is not good so I run over there and I'm like dude

00:35:36.08 what's up what's going on what's wrong and she goes uh

00:35:39.22 uh I don't know what to do and I'm like

00:35:41.19 oh [ __ ] what did her eyeball pop out or like Jesus this sounds bad like is she

00:35:45.09 having palpitations and she's like I don't know I don't know how it happened

00:35:48.16 I don't I don't know what to do uh and she's like panicking and I'm like

00:35:54.00 well what happened and she goes my keys were on the on the rubber maid and

00:35:57.20 and when I when I when I was pushing out the the door clipped it and they fell

00:36:01.18 and I think they fell down the elevator shaft and I'm like that's impossible and

00:36:07.11 so we move out and we look and sure enough she dropped her car and house and

00:36:12.11 everything keys off that rubber main they went straight

00:36:17.07 down the elevator into the abyss at 1030 at night the night before

00:36:22.06 thanksgiving and is this one of those storage facilities where there's no staff

00:36:27.09 well there's certainly no staff there at 10 o'clock at night and there's

00:36:32.00 certainly not going to be a staff there during the holidays

00:36:35.07 uh yeah it was dead ass empty so uh we were able to get in her car with the I

00:36:39.21 hadn't opened the back door yeah we were able to get in her car with her phone

00:36:43.05 you know she could like unlock the car with her phone and then she had to like

00:36:46.19 we had like uber home get my car or come back and finish or get extra

00:36:50.06 keys come back but she didn't get her [ __ ] car keys back until like Sunday

00:36:55.12 they had to like go in and like perform a procedure at the elevator to

00:37:01.07 [ __ ] block it off with two people had to wait for a dude to come in on Sunday

00:37:06.09 to do it just she got her [ __ ] case back and I guess they had been sitting

00:37:10.04 in water the entire time they were really fun I have been holding in a laugh

00:37:15.19 since that moment watching the [ __ ] I it's been

00:37:20.19 the hardest I have been such a supportive guy such a supportive

00:37:25.09 boyfriend I haven't made a joke or laughed about it or even snickered or it's

00:37:31.20 just been very conciliatory very calm and understanding this did not go well

00:37:37.05 she was not happy but oh my god is it funny that's incredible that's my

00:37:42.04 that's my little story why don't they have a nice little catchment trough

00:37:47.05 that's directly under the doors that just mails it out to you

00:37:52.02 I know because I feel like I've I know so many people have dropped stuff

00:37:56.08 straight down between the the floors well that's what I was telling her I was

00:37:59.22 like I bet this happens all the time like they probably are like jump into

00:38:03.07 action because they're like that happens twice a week your your brain went

00:38:07.04 catchment troughed mine went long sticks with magnets on them that's what I want

00:38:11.05 just magnet up that's just like fun you got to shove it

00:38:14.13 you don't want the people to have to do work no

00:38:17.07 it's fun it's not fun it's it's as fun when it's work I've said that the

00:38:22.13 opposite of what I wanted to say when it's fun

00:38:24.13 it isn't work that's just a game and you can maybe get somebody else's stuff you

00:38:27.19 don't know what's down there I don't know I feel like I'd feel iffy like

00:38:31.14 pissing about between you know the the flaws like what if the

00:38:36.10 lift drops and resident evils you or something no

00:38:39.08 or mission impossible one well maybe hmm yeah you throw a camera

00:38:43.06 yeah that was on the top like the reverse of a mission impossible I guess

00:38:47.12 I guess not what's one so mission impossible is one

00:38:50.06 where somebody gets killed at the top of an elevator what I think the

00:38:55.07 like catchment breaks uh go through his face

00:38:58.16 as he's looking up at them yes they do it's crazy that's a death at the top

00:39:02.18 what is the death at the bottom can you think of a move or somebody I just I

00:39:06.04 feel like it's harder to think of being crushed by an elevator than it is I've

00:39:11.09 seen some YouTube videos but I can't talk about

00:39:14.01 movies what do you mean by that like you've seen it happen in real life on

00:39:19.03 YouTube yeah yeah oh that's like terrible oh no I'm not I'm yeah no but people

00:39:24.09 getting squashed like a yeah well like a drunk person like uh opening

00:39:28.17 up the door and there's nothing there and they just fall through

00:39:32.19 it happens in oz but I can't think of a movie where it happens

00:39:36.09 I can't think of a singer and it must have it must have happened I can think of

00:39:42.04 scenes where like people have fallen with the elevator but never below the

00:39:45.14 elevator oh here we go uh the guy falls down and out okay let's look at the

00:39:50.12 let's open this link up because I there's a movie called 12 rounds with

00:39:54.07 john cena and he's trying to hold a guy up and he can't he can't lift him and he

00:39:58.18 falls with the elevator and the guy dies but that's not being below it

00:40:02.12 oh this guy has gone on this whole spree about I'm thinking of a movie where a

00:40:05.13 guy falls down an elevator shaft the first comment says I think it's marked

00:40:10.23 for death with Stephen c what Steven seagal yeah yeah you nailed it

00:40:16.02 Steven seagulls and then the link to the scene and the guy who wrote the post

00:40:21.05 said that's it turns out it wasn't an elevator shot what

00:40:25.01 that's somehow more disappointing than my resolution of clicking the video link

00:40:30.11 and being told video content from fox has blocked it on copyright ground yeah

00:40:35.09 not available so I can't see either wait yeah

00:40:37.10 screw face crucifixion what does that mean

00:40:40.00 is that what the video is called already clicked away doesn't sound like a good

00:40:44.08 time I don't think yeah I can think of so many ways in

00:40:46.21 which people have died in elevators that aren't related to being below it I got

00:40:50.20 someone falling down a shaft I got final destination two getting your head cut

00:40:55.03 off in the elevator can't think anything below it I would say it's rarer than a

00:40:59.10 person impersonating a character they're playing in a movie

00:41:04.21 yeah when one actor has to impersonate another because the original one got

00:41:08.21 squashed by a lift has that never happened to James bond that feels like a

00:41:12.17 thing that would have happened at some point in James bond to somebody what

00:41:16.08 someone impersonated someone else yeah no someone getting [ __ ] crushed by a

00:41:21.14 lift uh that's probably happened yeah I'd assume it exists it's somewhere

00:41:27.12 well thank god it didn't happen on Sunday I'll tell you that

00:41:31.09 so that was what the night before thanksgiving Geoff yeah yeah well

00:41:36.00 like the worst time going into a holiday what's your question Eric uh I just I

00:41:41.07 wanted to know specifically if Andrew calls it a lift or an elevator I don't

00:41:46.21 know where British English stops and oh it's

00:41:49.08 yeah it's definitely an elevator okay if it was just Gavin and I though I think

00:41:53.14 I'd say lyft but is that just for my benefit yeah

00:41:56.14 just for you because I know how you like your language I know how you speak uh

00:42:00.20 but if we're in a group we're in a group setting I would say elevator well Gavin

00:42:04.13 let me ask you a question if it was just if it was just you and Andrew you know

00:42:08.15 how he speaks would you say elevator to make him comfortable yeah

00:42:12.21 okay that's nice no when I'm here or it's like oh can you

00:42:16.08 take out I appreciate trash I would never say that on my own well I'm just

00:42:20.23 glad to see it goes both ways well no no we can't that doesn't work we're this

00:42:25.01 gen saying in a way in which we don't normally say it to the other person

00:42:28.21 if I'm calling it a lift and you're calling it an elevator

00:42:32.04 well then I just feel like we're both just like what are we doing at that point

00:42:36.02 there needs to be it can't go both ways I'll tell you what you're doing he's

00:42:40.02 being British and you're being Canadian it's gonna be give and take both ways

00:42:45.16 no it just has to be one way or else then what's the point of changing what

00:42:49.05 do you want to do with the heavy lifting then um I I don't really care we can

00:42:53.03 flip a coin it just can't go both ways it has to be only one way I think it's

00:42:58.04 the ultimate sign of respect to go both ways I just feel like we're both just

00:43:01.21 saying things we wouldn't normally say at that point and like what are we doing

00:43:05.18 yeah Eric has a good suggestion every time we hang out and then we'll

00:43:09.18 and that will determine who takes over all of the uh politeness

00:43:14.13 okay I like that yeah or what if you pick words like lift an

00:43:17.17 elevator and we flip a coin now and then

00:43:20.17 whichever way it goes that's just how we have to use that word forever

00:43:24.02 forever that's the power whatever it's like like in the context of any of us

00:43:28.17 hanging out from now until perpetuity we'd have to

00:43:32.03 say elevator do you want to just do you want to just pick one word right now and

00:43:35.18 I can flip a coin and heads you say it one way until you see it the other way

00:43:39.09 you just pick one word can we do trash and rubbish sure uh Gavin do you want uh

00:43:45.05 trash or rubbish to be heads uh let's put rubbish on tails

00:43:49.07 rubbish's tails trash's heads the coin is flipping what

00:43:52.12 I don't know if I can adopt rubbish why I just don't no one's off the table I

00:43:57.15 don't I don't think I could be a rubbish guy

00:44:01.14 so so your uh your conciliatory nature uh has a limit

00:44:05.05 it does and no it absolutely does there's certain because there's another

00:44:10.07 one uh edgeways edgewise I've never understood edgewise what does that mean

00:44:16.08 I don't know what it means but it's it's just I can't be a ways person I've been

00:44:21.14 a wise person too long I can't make that change Geoff I assume you're also

00:44:25.00 edgewise uh I'm edgewise uh what is that definition with the edge uppermost or

00:44:30.04 toward the viewer what that's the definition it's an

00:44:34.15 adverb with the edge uppermost or toward the viewer huh I always heard like I

00:44:39.00 can't get a word in edgeways like I can't even squeeze a word in like a

00:44:43.20 different way you say no I didn't get a word in edgewise what does that mean

00:44:48.07 how is it what like like imagine saying I can't get a word in sideways but you

00:44:53.18 say sidewise what does that mean well the phrase to get a word in

00:44:57.00 edgewise means to contribute to a conversation with difficulty because the

00:45:01.01 other speaker talks almost without a pause well yeah that's what it that's

00:45:04.21 what edgeways means that's what edgewise means but

00:45:08.08 but that that's what edgeways means is what I'm saying is it just like a

00:45:12.03 miscommunication across the ocean yes I feel like it's uh I couldn't care less I

00:45:17.14 could care less like people are just misusing what does this say here Eric

00:45:22.10 nick wrote definition of edgewise one sideways even the definition is ways

00:45:28.06 also uh I googled edgeways and it's not a word it doesn't come up

00:45:32.17 it's two words [Laughter]

00:45:36.06 edge wise is one word edge waves is two words this is so dumb

00:45:41.09 edge isn't in there that's not a phrase you made it out no one on.

00:45:49.12 [Music]

00:45:52.23 Edge waste is what Google thinks I'm saying.

00:46:00.10 I'm really glad I didn't just go with rubbish I'm so glad

00:46:05.11 what's weird about my rubbish rules is edgeways

00:46:09.03 edgeways it makes think about it that makes way more sense it does

00:46:15.05 I understand what he's saying unfortunately Google doesn't

00:46:19.01 what do you mean no I don't think you know what you're go ogling

00:46:23.08 I don't think you understand what you're doing tell me what to Google I don't I

00:46:27.06 don't have the answer to that either but

00:46:29.18 I don't think you know either Gavin tell me what to Google why would a different

00:46:33.20 version of edgeways be sideways but edgewise is also sideways okay just tell

00:46:38.21 me how to spell edgeways uh e-d-g-e hyphen w-i-s-e w-a-s damn what

00:46:47.03 you see when I do that it comes up uh edgeways edgewise yeah

00:46:52.17 e-d-g-e hyphen w-a-y-s I was reading I was reading

00:47:00.19 my brain's melody I was reading what nick wrote

00:47:07.01 what are you talking about why what's wrong with the hyphen Eric

00:47:11.14 it just uh was it I thought we were talking about

00:47:15.16 one word is ed edge waste is edge waste the right I don't know I'm confused now

00:47:20.15 that's what happens when you Google it but that says that's w-a-s-e

00:47:25.01 yeah edge wait no that might be what I said when I was saying it wrong hold on

00:47:30.04 I I really I really tell edgeways hey I I do want to say Geoff

00:47:34.06 you're doing your best for this and I'm proud of you like sideways

00:47:39.16 thanks man I really appreciate it the issue isn't that it's it's it's too

00:47:44.16 it's two words it's not a singular word for the expression it is he's saying

00:47:49.01 like the way in which the edge of the thing is facing right like a knife

00:47:54.10 maybe there's no hype I don't know maybe it's just edgeways is one word

00:47:59.05 this is a mess I'm ex I'm googled out buddy whoa edge

00:48:02.16 cool there if you said something was facing backwards would you say backwards

00:48:06.17 or back wise [Laughter]

00:48:18.23 I just wanted to flip a coin all right so trash is heads tails is brothers oh

00:48:24.07 no there's one there's one before we we do Kevin you told me everyone in Europe

00:48:29.03 says says edgeways

00:48:31.11 is that a lie are you just the only edgeways guy to what extent I feel like

00:48:36.22 everyone in england says edgeways okay there we go now I'm back on the team you

00:48:41.04 just really have to forget the first time I tried to spell it ignore that

00:48:44.09 that was all wrong [Laughter]

00:48:47.00 also I wanted to point out that when I couldn't what I couldn't uh pronounce

00:48:50.16 that name it's because it was spelt wrong

00:48:54.15 it was Stephen s e g a I and that was what confused me

00:48:59.05 all right what else what are the corrections a lot a lot of stuff's

00:49:03.13 confusing you lately huh yeah I don't know why I've been to open a window or

00:49:07.05 something tails I saw a [ __ ] can I think you guys got a billboard

00:49:12.04 oh right we gotta flip the coin we still doing that Andrew can you abide by the

00:49:18.00 rules of rubbish and okay yeah the rules of rubbish and trash

00:49:23.05 for me I would never call garbage rubbish but I would call

00:49:27.05 somebody who's like playing poorly at a game rup I would call someone their

00:49:32.04 trash as in rubbish what is the name of the receptacle that you would put

00:49:37.10 rubbish in it's tr it's a trash can yeah in america it's a trash can but now

00:49:43.00 we'll have to call it a rubbish bin right yeah rubbish bin so it's like a

00:49:47.05 twofold I didn't realize garburator wasn't a

00:49:50.12 universal term that was a weird one for me

00:49:54.09 huh garb is that not do you not is that not a Europe thing a garberator

00:50:00.08 is that like what gabo man uses what do you think a carburetor is Geoff

00:50:04.19 what do I think I think it's a I think it's probably a garbage disposal

00:50:09.12 yeah exactly that's exactly what it is this was the thing in the sink

00:50:13.18 garberator might be a it might be a brand name

00:50:16.03 is it I've only ever heard it referred to as a carburetor I called a garberator

00:50:20.22 set it to a group of people they had no idea what I was talking about

00:50:26.02 group of people from a different country very specific to point out this is not

00:50:31.14 uh it's a it's like it's a Canadian thing

00:50:34.17 yeah and is that a gun is that a pun-off car carburetor

00:50:37.20 I have no idea the origin it could be but I don't know the

00:50:42.02 definitive origin I haven't done my research on the history of the term

00:50:47.05 garberator but that's what we call imagine anyway

00:50:50.19 from america okay so are you abiding by rubbish bin

00:50:54.10 yeah he's got to uh yeah I guess I I can't so the word so if I if I lose this

00:50:59.11 coin toss I can never say trash in any context in

00:51:03.01 which I would normally say I'd have to replace it with rubbish yeah and if it's

00:51:06.11 the other way you have to do the same but reverse like for whenever you would

00:51:09.21 use the word rubbish you have to say trash now yeah but I would I would like

00:51:13.12 to point out that you potentially haven't listened again uh yeah okay

00:51:18.19 tails on my tails oh you called tails okay well then it's heads and I just

00:51:23.17 want I'm looking at heads no I haven't flipped it yet that's why I I just

00:51:27.09 shared my screen so that way we can see it and then you don't call deception and

00:51:30.15 then it's a whole thing lawyers involved okay well no just one

00:51:34.16 second who's the away person here who's more I I think I'm away so I get to call

00:51:40.17 the toss what are you away from you got you every everyone else in this place is

00:51:44.15 in the same place in the same city I'm the furthest I'm the only one naughty

00:51:49.10 same country

00:51:57.22 yeah but you currently live flying away I I live away

00:52:05.03 you call it you stick with tails no you can have tails if you want okay I

00:52:10.07 I just I I feel like Eric is sharing his screen and it's a virtual coin I want a

00:52:13.18 real coin yeah I kind of want to really I can go run and get you you want to get

00:52:17.09 a real coin all right get a real coin please while he's doing that let me tell

00:52:22.10 you a funny billboard I saw I'd love to hear about your money just a

00:52:25.20 very brief thing I saw I saw a billboard yesterday on i-35 that said keep Austin

00:52:30.21 weird which is you know a [ __ ] stupid phrase we've had for 25 years keep

00:52:36.02 Austin weird like high cost of living weird Ohio it was a billboard advertising

00:52:41.07 people advertising another state the state of Ohio is spending money on

00:52:46.21 billboards in Austin trying to tell people to leave Austin to move to Ohio

00:52:53.04 states are trying to poach each other that's how you know you [ __ ] made it

00:52:58.05 as a city when an entire state on the other side of the country spends

00:53:02.09 thousands of dollars to try to convince the people that live here to move there

00:53:06.06 instead that's [ __ ] ludicrous I feel like that's that's that's not what's

00:53:10.21 happening I think that's an Austin billboard I think they're trying to

00:53:13.18 convince people to leave.

00:53:16.08 [Laughter]

00:53:19.09 It was funded by austinites who've lived here for more than 10 years

00:53:24.19 can you imagine

00:53:29.20 could you imagine being in like like you're just walking around London like

00:53:34.04 in I don't know shore ditch or something and there's just a big billboard that's

00:53:37.18 like Norwich give it a try [Laughter]

00:53:41.03 okay Eric has coins are we doing multiple tosses are we doing like a best

00:53:46.06 of five on this coin toss no I think it's one and done I just here's the

00:53:51.01 thing here's what happened I know how you operate because we've done

00:53:55.10 81 episodes of the show so I've chosen one of every coin [Laughter]

00:54:01.14 so I have I'm going to let you choose or who you

00:54:05.12 guys come to a consensus I have a penny I have a nickel I don't I have a dime

00:54:10.19 okay I have a quarter four and I have a half dollar okay you have

00:54:15.18 five so just flip all of them and we'll do best of five what do they call the

00:54:20.01 half dollar yeah just dude flip all of them what's that flip all of them

00:54:24.00 like how why do I have a half dollar I don't know what do they have a special

00:54:29.05 name for it just half dollar oh it's just this is half says half

00:54:32.15 dollar on it okay hard to see but yep uh okay are we do are we flipping all five

00:54:37.10 and then all five and we'll take a pause

00:54:39.04 between we can reevaluate if you want to

00:54:41.12 maintain heads or tails okay do you have a do you have a top down angle uh I can

00:54:45.11 try to do one oh that's great how's that yeah that works fantastic cool okay

00:54:50.10 here's the penny we are saying heads I'm tails

00:55:56.00 it can't happen this is gonna be a comeback of the ages

00:56:00.04 on this flip what is this a quarter you think it's this is a dime we're doing a

00:56:20.23 what what did it land on out of bounds doesn't matter I I agree

00:56:25.11 it should be out of bounds and I won't I agree but I will not tell you.

00:56:35.09 I'm not counting it no I'm locked it you're locked in none of us are allowed

00:56:40.10 to know it's fine yep I'll tell you afterwards okay here we go Andrew

00:56:47.11 Andrew what yeah you're not going to like this

00:56:51.05 well am I not going to like the fact that it was tails and you flipped it

00:56:56.06 again is that what I'm not going to like it's

00:57:10.06 flip the other two

00:57:15.14 do you want to change no no I'm going to hold tails there's no it's got to be

00:57:20.23 tails eventually oh it's off doesn't count does it count it's a false

00:57:27.02 the redo it's a heads

00:57:29.20 no way I swear to god hey Andrew when it fell off it landed on heads

00:57:36.15 [ __ ] off heads there's no way I lose seven in a row tails tails here it goes

00:57:45.14 up.

00:57:48.15 It rolled off here we go roll

00:57:52.13 push it through yep it's landed on heads [ __ ] no way there's no way what did

00:58:05.11 there we go so we got one I had one no you didn't get any you got nothing no

00:58:10.23 but it landed one like at least you flipped it eight times

00:58:15.07 and I'll say this at no point was it a sock [Laughter]

00:58:19.20 which is still for sale in our store buy them eleven and a half months early for

00:58:24.12 next Christmas I like that heads was open and uh you st

00:58:28.03 I'd already picked tails and then you picked tails so I had to go heads if you

00:58:31.16 didn't [Laughter]

00:58:34.20 listen god damn I like tail I had a good

00:58:37.16 feeling about tails talk about snatching defeat from the claws of victory that's

00:58:43.11 the best luck I've ever had from heads I'll be honest I'm usually a tails guy

00:58:47.20 yeah every time I was surprised I'm a tales guy too

00:58:50.14 the worst luck what is the the nfl hasn't the super bowl it's been the same

00:58:54.17 thing for like 18 years or whatever on their coin toss is that heads or tails

00:58:59.07 no way that's what I should have went in yeah it's been like the same

00:59:03.01 I don't think I'm making that up I think for like an extended period of time it

00:59:06.08 has been the same call every time that has won uh I'll just go back through the

00:59:11.01 last five heads tails heads heads tails okay I just made that

00:59:16.04 I thought that was the thing I thought it was like a lock every year

00:59:20.12 I thought that was the thing I was wrong about that I was clearly incorrect hey

00:59:25.09 Andrew yes when you're done with your apple where are you gonna throw it

00:59:30.01 the rubbish [Laughter]

00:59:34.08 I mean you can compost that's true no I will actually I will

00:59:38.14 compost it that's right that's actually the correct answer

00:59:41.13 why don't you uh why don't you pop one of those cosmic crypts in your mouth and

00:59:44.17 see what's up we're doing this is the finale we're doing the big finale I'm

00:59:48.04 gonna finally taste this cosmic crisp this is exciting I've been waiting days

00:59:52.07 to do this I thought I did it once so I get to relive the experience a second

00:59:56.08 time how lucky am I here we go oh nick recorded the video

01:00:00.00 that's awesome that's awesome oh that was a nice big crunch I heard that

01:00:05.11 it's so goofy he's got the right one we got the crunch

01:00:10.08 he's eating the right apple

01:00:14.23 holy [ __ ]

01:00:19.14 he turned into Donald duck [Laughter]

01:00:26.17 don't

01:00:32.23 this is a delicious apple this is really good

01:00:36.13 oh we may have we may have figured out the third apple now that that's in his

01:00:42.06 top seven no this is so wow you might have to kick one out

01:00:46.08 that's the thing I'm getting if secretly

01:00:49.16 pink lady was my number one apple I love a pink lady I think it's a fantastic

01:00:55.00 apple for so many reasons wait wait you bought your favorite apple and couldn't

01:00:59.10 tell you or eat it yeah well yeah because it's it's there's like a

01:01:04.17 variation of it I love a pink lady I thought that's how good the cosmic crisp

01:01:10.06 was I was like this is a delicious apple but having the back to back unknowingly

01:01:14.15 originally I think the cosmic crisp might be better than a pink lady which I

01:01:20.06 did not expect so it rains as the best apple this might be my current favorite

01:01:26.02 apple wow wow wow so better than a 6 out of 10 then I

01:01:29.16 think this would be a phenomenal apple juice good crunch

01:01:34.14 texture is fine Eric while andrew's eating do you want to talk about the

01:01:39.12 cider that you had yeah I went to a brewery in san Diego and just by

01:01:42.17 happenstance I can't escape the show so they had cosmic crisp cider and I talked

01:01:47.11 to the bartender and they said oh yeah it's from this one place and cosmic

01:01:51.12 crisp is like this is like the best one they do and it's really made with cosmic

01:01:54.22 crisp apples and I had it and it tasted like

01:01:57.22 cos I gave it a 6 out of 10. I mean it tasted like the cosmic crisp was the

01:02:02.22 bartender peter stormer no unfortunately you did say that it became a six and a

01:02:08.01 half out of ten after you were done when I was done it went up about half a

01:02:13.22 point I did I did enjoy it it's just it wasn't so sugary which was nice but

01:02:17.09 also it's a cider so it's kind of like you know how much do you really want to

01:02:22.19 drink of those that's gonna help me out I I gotta

01:02:25.22 I'm going to upgrade my rank from before this is better from an eight this is

01:02:30.10 better than an eight wow I'm giving this apple a 9.2 oh

01:02:35.14 this is a good app I feel like we did not eat the same apple oh my god this is

01:02:42.13 okay 9.2 it's better than a honey crisp I think it's better than a pink lady

01:02:47.16 which was my previous I think this might be my favorite apple wow that's bold

01:02:52.18 this is wow so you ate your two favorite apples in the same podcast yeah I'm

01:02:56.18 gonna continue eat I'm just gonna finish both of these let me well let me

01:03:00.08 actually that's a great point I'm gonna take a bite of the pink lady now

01:03:04.06 oh [ __ ] I don't know

01:03:08.02 he's got terrible apple memory no it's this is like an apple goldfish

01:03:14.06 this is also really good apple hmm [Laughter]

01:03:20.13 I don't this might this might be this is this

01:03:23.18 genuinely might be the LeBron James versus Michael Jordan of apples is what

01:03:29.08 we're having right now these are two all-time greats I don't know how to

01:03:33.03 measure them it's tough they both have different things you know what

01:03:37.20 I think we're gonna solve this in a year from next week

01:03:40.12 if the cosmic crisp holds for one whole year in a fridge I think it's undeniably

01:03:45.09 the greatest Eric wrote did you mix them up and bite cosmic Chris yeah

01:03:50.12 how are we to be I'm I'm making sure I'm looking at the

01:03:54.04 stickers on both what's the sticker what's the cosmic crisp sticker I just I

01:03:59.03 just peeled it off oh my god it's somewhere in one sec where did I

01:04:03.21 put it did you have bad glue from your sticker

01:04:06.21 no uh yeah I did actually I kind of noticed when I peeled it I gotta work on

01:04:10.20 that yeah put the sticker I just literally peeled it off after you know I was

01:04:16.02 thinking about what I found I got it three five oh seven

01:04:20.12 three five seven seven oh different batch different batch interesting uh

01:04:26.17 you know what I was thinking we were talking about last week uh

01:04:31.11 or at some point in the past inventing our own apple yeah and then

01:04:35.01 and then some scientist uh comment lever really dissuaded me from it it sounded

01:04:38.23 complicated but I but then I I just had an idea I was thinking about this

01:04:42.14 earlier today actually I almost ate an apple I almost ate a red delicious that

01:04:46.04 was in my kitchen and then I was like yeah I don't want to and you know what

01:04:49.20 turned me away I realized I don't like the apple skin

01:04:53.07 we can that's the only thing that keeps me from an apple oh I use my thought

01:04:58.20 for those of us who don't like the skin I can't be the only one for those of us

01:05:02.18 who don't like an apple skin I would someone should invent maybe it's us a

01:05:08.12 skinless apple that grows that way you mean or rots on the tree

01:05:11.21 well it wouldn't last a year but hear me I got an innovative idea as well

01:05:16.10 what if we invented a product that could peel an apple

01:05:19.16 what about that well I think that probably if you could run it through

01:05:24.08 and just you've never used one who's what the apple peeler

01:05:27.14 who are you talking to well you're saying it to invent

01:05:31.14 something but it already exists yeah that was the [ __ ] I was being sarcastic

01:05:35.12 you pile of rubbish you gotta work on you gotta I you you you gotta work on

01:05:41.11 sarcasm what you don't think I [ __ ]

01:05:44.00 know what an apple peeler is the apple you think the apple guy doesn't know

01:05:47.08 what an apple peeler is what it doesn't it didn't sound like sarcasm

01:05:52.10 I was being facetious you've got outraged down pat but sarcasm I'm gonna

01:05:56.04 give you honestly two out of ten so Geoff you're on my side with like whether or

01:05:59.12 not that was real yeah no no for sure what I give them a two out of ten on the

01:06:03.00 sarcasm scale what do you think how do I can I run it can I retry it can I

01:06:06.20 retrieve it I thought it was such a waste statement like it was so obviously

01:06:12.02 false I I mean I I guess I could kind of see that so

01:06:14.15 I'll give it a two but really it was just like I just thought you didn't know

01:06:18.15 what an apple peeler was okay well let me how do I hmm

01:06:21.06 maybe it was just really good sarcasm let me yeah well I just kind of drive

01:06:25.22 how do I it's drier than a pink lady all right take two

01:06:30.01 so what about this nah that didn't sounded genuine that's not I don't know

01:06:36.10 do I not know how to be sarcastic how do I be circular

01:06:40.18 no okay so what about this [Laughter]

01:06:43.15 what if I don't

01:06:49.03 somebody else say it sarcastically and then I can copy that well Geoff's the
