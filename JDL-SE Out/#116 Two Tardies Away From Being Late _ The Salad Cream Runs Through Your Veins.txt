00:00:00.03 [Music]

00:00:07.23 [Music]

00:00:15.09 He did it he's on time wow look at you hello and welcome to another episode of

00:00:23.16 the F**kFuckFacePodcast I don't know the number year volume none of that's important

00:00:29.11 anymore my name is Geoff Ramsey with me as always Andrew panton and Gavin free

00:00:34.22 uh Gavin congratulations you made it exactly on time I didn't remember to

00:00:39.20 mute my speaker though that was quite loud what do you mean hear it yeah at all

00:00:45.11 which is interesting because last week you were late by a couple minutes and

00:00:50.12 then I was tuning in to one of our sister podcasts this week the rooster

00:00:54.10 teeth podcast which is one of the other ones that you frequent and you were a

00:00:59.16 good I would say nine minutes late to that one and that got me wondering

00:01:04.13 do we need to have some sort of an on-time intervention what is happening

00:01:09.07 in your life that the the thing that like the bedrock that you stake claim to

00:01:14.15 being punctual is is is is no longer attainable for you I could get a car I

00:01:19.03 think that would help quite a lot do you

00:01:21.03 think that's what it was when you didn't show up to a face but you haven't had a

00:01:25.12 car before you know you've well I got last time I got yelled at by Geoff when I

00:01:29.00 stormed off and got to the podcast early without saying hello to you

00:01:33.03 yeah I didn't see you yesterday so that was yeah I didn't make you late to the

00:01:37.00 rt podcast with a hello this week coming in hot off another video there's not

00:01:41.07 enough time people not showing up on time now I'm late

00:01:45.09 I have been late a lot I hate being late it seems like a trend yeah I just want

00:01:48.16 to make sure everything's okay personally if you're not like

00:01:51.04 experiencing any trouble or trauma or issues or do you take some time away or

00:01:55.06 no I'm just I mean if you could see me I'm not scrambling around trying to make

00:01:59.01 it on time I'm just stood there waiting for a car to shut down my damn thumbs

00:02:04.12 how late would you have to be before you just didn't show up at all what's your

00:02:09.12 line oh that's a great question um I don't physically know how I could be

00:02:14.05 an hour late yeah I think I'm in the same boat I think I would just come anyway

00:02:19.05 really yeah I guess it depends on the thing if

00:02:22.21 I'm supposed to be there at a certain time if I'm 45 minutes late I'm just not

00:02:28.06 gonna show up I'm just not gonna go dude

00:02:30.22 I one time had dinner with previous ceo of the company Ezra years and years ago

00:02:36.07 in san Francisco and he showed up to dinner that he

00:02:39.22 booked at a sushi restaurant that he wanted to take me to three hours late

00:02:46.19 yeah I've had that same I had the same thing with him you just didn't go you

00:02:51.20 you didn't show up you missed you're not three hours late you didn't go he just

00:02:55.13 didn't go and he would keep texting me like I'll be there in 45 minutes showing

00:03:00.02 up three hours late is the same as showing up the day after like or you got

00:03:05.09 the day wrong he made a dinner reservation at seven

00:03:09.07 o'clock and we ate dinner at like 945.

00:03:12.00 That's ridiculous yeah busy people I guess

00:03:14.22 I feel like y'all though I I think if you're more than 45 minutes late you

00:03:18.16 just you can't make it you just can't show up that late yeah it removes the

00:03:24.00 lateness in my mind if I never go then I was never late

00:03:27.14 like I would like it is that the point do you think like 44 to 45 minutes is

00:03:32.09 when it crosses over it like the needle passes from late to absent I think it

00:03:36.18 also depends on if you're in contact with that person hmm that's a great

00:03:41.12 point as well like did you were you texting

00:03:43.19 Ezra when you were yeah he was texting me going hey buddy I'll be I'll be there

00:03:47.03 in 45 minutes running a little late five minutes later um he's still going

00:03:51.04 to be about 40 meetings after that he was probably wasn't even in san

00:03:54.19 Francisco he's probably taking a plane two seconds

00:03:57.16 he was in the wrong state he was like that was six seven years ago it was a

00:04:00.18 while ago I don't know it's not nice to be known for being late I feel like no

00:04:06.08 if you're usually on time then it's how many more

00:04:08.22 how many more uh tardy tardies would you

00:04:12.00 have to have before you admit you have a problem I think I'm two

00:04:16.10 tardy appearances away from being someone who's late [Laughter]

00:04:20.15 now is this a system that clears or is it like can you

00:04:24.23 it's like when your shield recharges if I go like six months without any

00:04:28.09 weakness I think I could then potentially get three late lates before

00:04:32.08 I late personally but I've used up like I feel like I've used up two two lives

00:04:36.09 recently the problem the problem with that is that's that's

00:04:40.04 absolutely how that works but the scale is so difficult it's kind of like how

00:04:45.20 it's like so easy to lose your parents trust but so hard yes

00:04:49.15 so much more work to get it back than it did

00:04:52.06 than the offense I feel like it's this like you can get you can definitely

00:04:56.02 knock three or four of those those at least three of those tardies off but

00:04:59.20 it's got it's an inordinate amount of time it is and it takes forever to

00:05:03.16 reverse that if you become a late guy it's gonna take four years of on time

00:05:08.07 before you could reverse that as opposed to like missing two things every six

00:05:12.11 months you don't get the perception once you have that label you can't check do

00:05:16.05 you think six months is enough time to recharge the shield of one lateness oh

00:05:20.08 for sure yeah I think without it I think so I would say though if you're just

00:05:25.09 looking at amount of effort and work if you think it's possible that you might

00:05:28.22 be late two more times in the next I don't know three months or so would

00:05:33.11 probably be the window I would consider just changing my personality to a late

00:05:38.03 guy I think it might be easier than trying to repair the damage to just

00:05:42.00 just go all in and embrace it just become a different person I just could

00:05:46.08 not double down on that I just don't have I don't have that in me

00:05:50.00 because I would be the biggest hypocrite

00:05:51.19 in the world I hate when people are late [Laughter]

00:05:54.23 I guess I don't know it would be a philosophy change right you wouldn't be

00:05:58.10 a hypocrite at a certain point you could have like a coming to lightness moment

00:06:02.23 where you realize you know what this is this is the life I've been

00:06:06.20 missing [ __ ] everybody else

00:06:09.09 Andrew your wordsmithing is phenomenal this week

00:06:14.10 oh man I'm glad you're be able to make it on time Gavin yeah glad you were here

00:06:19.15 because last time it was rough we had a rough start with yeah things kind of

00:06:23.03 collapsed it was bad pleasantries last time I wrote down on my notes to have an

00:06:28.12 on-time intervention with you but this is this is not what this was this is

00:06:32.21 more just like concerned friends letting you know giving you a heads up that an

00:06:37.06 intervention could be uh on the horizon with a few more tardies under your belt

00:06:40.17 yeah I mean I feel like off a podcast would be a nicer place to do that but

00:06:44.06 sure

00:06:46.15 dude it's impossible to stay off the podcast

00:06:50.04 Andrew approached me last week and said hey man we need to talk and I was like

00:06:54.11 okay and he goes you and I we need a thing we don't have a thing right now

00:06:58.08 it's not basketball season it's not hockey season

00:07:01.06 uh though we have been out of sync on that for a while anyway it was

00:07:03.23 collecting cards for a while but then we

00:07:04.17 turned that into content we built a show around it we need like a thing that you

00:07:09.11 and I do uh like to maintain our friendship in

00:07:12.12 the off seasons of basketball since we lost the some of the other things that

00:07:16.14 we had and the second he he presented that to me all I could think about is

00:07:20.11 what kind of things we could come up with for the show

00:07:23.14 even today I was like I think I'm missing the point of this whole exercise

00:07:27.14 because everything you bring up I just want to turn into content oh it's fair

00:07:32.00 and then try to make the case of what if we made the fact it isn't content

00:07:35.20 content what if that's the content the thing that we we're doing this thing

00:07:39.04 that we don't ever talk about but we talk about that we're not talking like

00:07:42.22 two two guys try not to make content I guess yeah yeah what a terrible

00:07:47.22 it's just like this all goes to say gab I think it's impossible to have this

00:07:52.02 conversation off the podcast because the podcast is now

00:07:56.07 23 hours of a day of our lives it's it's a weird thing to try to think of

00:08:01.14 hobbies in that way too I've never really been like I need to

00:08:06.05 find a thing it's always been like I come across something and think that

00:08:09.22 would be great the best idea I've had so far and just

00:08:13.09 trying to think of hobbies to come up with is Geoff and I becoming metal

00:08:18.02 detector guys like buying a metal detector like being

00:08:21.22 the people that walk on a beach I guess I don't know like I like the idea

00:08:25.17 yeah that's that was the problem and it then turned into what if it was like a

00:08:29.11 sport where you have like a field of dirt and there are bean holes everywhere

00:08:34.01 and you have to try to find the one the beans like you got to go and find a

00:08:38.21 cost a yeah exactly it turned into a whole thing

00:08:42.13 oh man and see and you just very quickly suddenly we're writing content for the

00:08:47.11 show we are yeah it's all passing the challenges for survivor I guess

00:08:52.03 well it's a mix of like discovery and competitive eating like imagine if joey

00:08:57.02 chestnut had to find the hot dogs like it's a two-layer thing that we're

00:09:02.11 doing here I don't think competitive eating has ever had competitive

00:09:06.20 searching tasks yeah he had to have military land navigation skills

00:09:11.05 he's out there with a compass that's where we connect

00:09:16.13 it is it's great I love it there could be ones with fake beans I don't know we

00:09:21.18 have a lot that we could possibly work with with the jelly beans jelly beans

00:09:27.18 dude imagine if you dug up a bean hole and then for dessert you dug up a jelly

00:09:33.07 bean hole [Laughter]

00:09:35.23 I'm imagining it being like a little little bean container within the bean

00:09:41.12 container like a Russian doll type thing it'd just be like a slab of sugar a

00:09:45.21 cylinder it's just melted

00:09:48.20 oh I'd be terrible if you melted a bunch of jelly beans like every flavor into

00:09:54.04 one thing that'd be awful be a terrible taste I

00:09:58.07 think so yeah if you if you melted every flavor simultaneously

00:10:02.13 I bet that's terrible I bet it tastes like nothing but it's just unpleasant I

00:10:07.18 gotta I gotta admit something to you guys I'm excited what's your confession

00:10:11.20 the other night we were cooking uh just like it was one of those nights where

00:10:15.23 nobody got a hold of dinner ahead of time so it was just sort of like make

00:10:20.02 what make whatever you can find laying around the house

00:10:24.02 and uh Emily found some corn dogs in the freezer state fair corn dogs

00:10:29.09 and she [ __ ] she put them on the air fryer and she cooked up some corn dogs

00:10:32.19 and they smelled so [ __ ] good I thought about eating one

00:10:37.00 you didn't do it though but I didn't do it wow see that would have been the

00:10:41.10 perfect corn dog update as opposed to last week when you just brought it up

00:10:45.07 nothing happened yeah but and then something happened

00:10:48.00 right and uh it was just like it was almost like as almost like like

00:10:51.11 mentioning it last time willed it to happen this time uh it was close I would

00:10:55.22 say I was like uh I was like 4060 on eating it yeah it was wow

00:11:01.06 yeah what could have tilted the scale uh like what what was the if I had

00:11:06.03 honestly if I hadn't had a microwave pizza oh wow or a frozen pizza

00:11:10.23 I got saved by a pizza yeah screaming Italian pizza uh the corn dogs

00:11:17.12 are the pizza pizza uh probably three weeks okay

00:11:22.04 three three weeks to a month I would say I can't remember when I bought it but I

00:11:26.13 bought it not not too too long ago certainly not like three days ago

00:11:31.00 how does that make you feel Andrew that's fine people can shop how they

00:11:34.12 shop I just have never considered shopping that way I did want to clarify

00:11:38.07 within this episode I don't want to pivot away Geoff if you have more to

00:11:41.11 expand I got nothing else that's my I just had another update

00:11:44.18 we've talked about it for a long time I think I'm going to do

00:11:49.01 the grocery cap thing next week well the end caps the end caps but I had some

00:11:53.02 questions I wanted to clarify before I did this I was gonna start I was

00:11:57.18 thinking like maybe Wednesday next week so it'd be a day in when we recorded um

00:12:02.02 so it's the end caps is there any other restrictions like I'm

00:12:05.10 assuming I can't use the back of the store at all

00:12:08.12 you know because there's like the open like deli yeah nothing on the walls

00:12:12.11 nothing on the walls nothing like none of the little island cases that are kind

00:12:16.08 of between the different things purely I mean I feel like if there's an island

00:12:21.05 you could potentially shop off the end of the island

00:12:24.01 yeah yeah I I'm less I islands actually seem okay to me if they're in like the

00:12:29.09 larger thoroughfare I would say if you have to go down a lane

00:12:32.17 okay to get to it I would think that'd be a no because that would be past the

00:12:36.19 end cap see I feel like you can't traverse past an end cap so islands are

00:12:40.22 okay as long as I don't hit the middle of whatever the content is of the island

00:12:45.13 whatever I mean I would be okay with that how about you gav yeah why don't we

00:12:49.20 just say you plant your feet at the end cap whatever you can reach is

00:12:54.03 no because he's going to come up with he's going to create some sort of a pole

00:12:59.09 with a grabber it's got to be from the end cap yeah I

00:13:03.00 can't go into the row at all it has to be an end cap yeah is there any

00:13:07.12 restrictions on how much of an item I could get

00:13:10.07 no I don't think so really so you're gonna have access to a lot of batteries

00:13:14.07 you might as well buy them no I feel like because there's always it's gonna

00:13:17.17 really come down to what's in the freezer end cap I feel like because

00:13:22.04 there's always that kind of like open freezer section area that's end cap

00:13:27.02 I might just like have to buy 20 pizzas that just might be what my life

00:13:31.23 now how do we feel how do we feel about the

00:13:35.12 uh like the impulse buy section at the checkout are we okay like where the

00:13:39.14 magazines and the Archie comments and point of sale stuff yeah point of sale

00:13:43.08 stuff are we okay I feel like that's got to be fair game it's not really no

00:13:46.21 because they put a bunch of different convenience stuff there that's gonna

00:13:50.17 make it too easy I think you think so but not to survive off of it's gonna be

00:13:54.01 like [ __ ] pringles and chocolate bars I guess it's true it's like snickers and

00:13:58.17 gum you never if he wants to live off kinder eggs he can I guess yeah

00:14:03.03 like I'm not a good point you never see a bag of rice at the checkout like

00:14:08.15 nobody is buying real food at the express it's true

00:14:11.22 it's mainly it's mainly like gum mints and magazines about what Meghan markle's

00:14:16.17 been doing you want to take away my gum Gavin you monster

00:14:20.13 what uh one other point of clarification I think needs to be made here that just

00:14:24.00 popped into my head I'm trying to think of ways that Andrew could flaunt the

00:14:27.18 system uh if you go to an end cap and there's an out-of-place item in the

00:14:33.18 end cap like a bag of flour and you just happen to need flour

00:14:37.18 or whatever I feel like that's off-limits it's not from the end cap

00:14:42.05 it's not of the end cap it shouldn't be able it shouldn't be accessible as such

00:14:46.06 because then you could have your partner go in and get like a bunch of frozen

00:14:51.11 goods for your eggs and then place them strategically around

00:14:54.06 the grocery store for you to find and I just I feel like we gotta head that off

00:14:57.22 now yeah my my thinking was that Andrew would befriend the store owner and ask

00:15:03.11 for a custom end cap to be like oh he's gonna get

00:15:05.18 milk and bread in the same end you know that's just as plausible

00:15:09.20 yeah I I appreciate my head was not there but that is a great it would be a

00:15:14.08 workaround for sure so end caps only islands are okay within

00:15:19.01 a certain distance checkout is okay and it's one week right that's the goal

00:15:23.14 survive a week off and cap can I go to the grocery store as much as I want to

00:15:27.09 yeah I think so okay yeah I kind of don't want you to eat 14 pizzas though

00:15:32.01 because yeah I know die well that's I think that's so you think that's what's

00:15:35.04 gonna kill him you and I approached that differently I was like I feel like

00:15:38.21 that'd just be kind of a lame way to do this it'd be almost maybe it'd be lame

00:15:42.04 but also it's terrible he's gonna have access to like cheez-its

00:15:47.11 powdered donuts and gatorade like there's not gonna be a lot of food out

00:15:52.06 there for him he's gonna have access he's gonna have

00:15:55.00 access to ice cream cones but not ice cream

00:15:59.14 and are you gonna is this one store are you gonna end cap

00:16:03.07 I think I'm gonna just go to one store I think that should be part of it I

00:16:08.01 appreciate I the rules of this could be ridiculous like you guys can make it so

00:16:12.10 if it's like aisle six I can get up to six items like there are all sorts of

00:16:15.14 restrictions you could do with this thing this seems kind of simple I'm

00:16:19.07 pretty confident that this will be fine yeah I think we crawl before we walk and

00:16:22.21 then run we got plenty of life ahead of us to come up with aisle six uh stuff

00:16:27.04 are you gonna be able to document or provide pictures of what you

00:16:30.07 eat each day yeah yeah I will that's what I honestly think the funniest photo

00:16:33.17 will be will be whatever my first haul looks like of stuff from the end cap can

00:16:38.02 we have can I can we can I get with the social team and have one at least have a

00:16:42.12 daily update on the face absolutely okay that'd be fantastic 100 what if we open

00:16:46.23 it up to uh he can also forage

00:16:53.20 like walk through the woods and find mushrooms and [ __ ]

00:16:57.16 he's gonna poison himself eating [ __ ]

00:17:00.08 that he thinks is food there's no way I'm definitely getting a metal detector

00:17:04.13 now this isn't a psychological loan on Netflix

00:17:09.01 I just love the idea of Andrew treating it like he's lost

00:17:12.19 like a solo expedition but he's just in the middle of his own town

00:17:18.00 I'm gonna get arrested going into an old backyard of a place I used to live at

00:17:22.03 that I know has an apple tree it's gonna it's gonna be bad you're gonna get

00:17:25.23 arrested for scrumping you don't

00:17:29.18 oh my god okay so I think I got it I don't think I'll salad cream this in any

00:17:34.18 way it seems very straightforward I'm excited to start this process next week

00:17:39.04 here's the thing with you though about and salad creaming I don't think

00:17:44.04 you intend to salad cream oh I think the cream runs through your veins

00:17:49.12 very rarely yeah.

00:17:51.21 [Music]

00:17:54.13 [Laughter]

00:17:56.19 What percentage do you think.

00:18:09.07 I'm gonna stay [Laughter]

00:18:19.09 I think you've gotta you gotta sit down yes Eric says six months of no salad

00:18:25.14 cream

00:18:29.18 you have to be almost halfway there I don't think here's how you avoid it

00:18:34.21 you have to sit down with yourself before you present anything or post

00:18:39.09 anything or decide anything just sit down and think

00:18:42.18 what what is Geoff and Gavin after all right what do we want from it what are

00:18:47.14 we trying to see and just try and provide it just try and

00:18:52.06 visualize that and go for that goal okay

00:18:54.17 oh I don't think I sour cream this there is a potential for a solid cream I uh I

00:19:00.01 I sent the I mean if it's on an end cap absolutely.

00:19:04.21 I sent the cosmic Chris people a dm the other day because they followed me on

00:19:10.16 twitter I was like hey type thing reaching out saying hi

00:19:14.14 I brought up the podcast that we that we reviewed the cosmic crisp and they

00:19:19.01 replied back um being like hey it's so great we appreciate the support so much

00:19:23.14 could you link us uh the episode in which you guys talk about this because

00:19:27.16 the team I'm sure would love to listen to it god so then I was in a real

00:19:33.01 dilemma I didn't know what to say because I could either

00:19:36.21 I could have done it again you tuxedoed it stop emailing people you're ruining

00:19:42.06 everything stop drawing people's attention to us who are we

00:19:46.17 [ __ ] on this fight well that's the problem let us [ __ ]

00:19:51.02 Under the radar man yeah because I could send the cosmic crisp review we did but

00:19:56.08 it's almost all of you guys saying this isn't that great this is very average

00:20:00.15 which I don't think is reflective of the opinions of the show necessarily

00:20:04.18 in our defense well in their defense we would just talk about

00:20:08.22 how it's just an apple yeah [Laughter]

00:20:11.11 yeah so I think as an apple it's good but it is still just a six out of 10

00:20:17.02 fruit so then I sent them I I picked and what I had to go into our catalog and

00:20:21.04 find the episode of where I reviewed the cosmic crisp

00:20:25.09 uh but that is just a general episode which that happens in I also

00:20:30.17 gave a review worse than realized that it was a pink lady and had to do a

00:20:35.20 review there's no way to submit them anything

00:20:39.03 that isn't heavily edited I will send them both unedited full video or audios

00:20:46.21 and uh and then let's just find a new fruit let's get into pears [Laughter]

00:20:53.12 yeah I haven't heard back might as well just be honest with them about what it

00:20:57.20 is and who we are and then we'll just you know we'll pivot onto another

00:21:02.10 like another round fruit oranges are popular everybody lives in

00:21:06.19 orange I don't I feel like I rarely see anything about a new orange not a

00:21:11.12 [ __ ] a lot of work to get to an orange too I hate it I hate it

00:21:15.04 nothing I like less than peeling an orange

00:21:17.12 yeah I guess like I was going to say I don't want you know

00:21:20.02 fingers man you can't ha you can't eat orange without having shitty little kids

00:21:23.22 sticky fingers like you're five years old sitting on your grandma's back porch

00:21:28.19 I hate it but Eric just said just bite in are you are you serious

00:21:33.18 what are you doing nobody just bites into an orange yeah I mean you got to be

00:21:39.05 the change you want to see in the world so if you don't want if you don't want

00:21:43.22 sticky fingers just take a bite and then spit it out and pretend like you're

00:21:47.12 doing a grenade or something you know but then you have to bite

00:21:50.21 you have to bite all the way around you gotta buy all the peel off yeah that's

00:21:52.23 the problem yeah but I think you could probably peel some with your teeth and

00:21:56.19 kind of work it through and it's not as sticky on your fingies maybe like once

00:22:00.05 you get it started um yeah a little bit of that juice out you know we need to do

00:22:04.07 this sounds like a problem for a uniform

00:22:06.12 boy we haven't talked about uniform in a while uh uniform combining the power of

00:22:10.15 one with the fabric of the farm uniform uh we should invent fruit gloves

00:22:15.01 what do you mean fruit you mean like special gloves special gloves for you to

00:22:20.06 use uh that make it that enhance the fruit eating experience

00:22:25.09 obviously they have to do more than just cover your fingers from the stickies

00:22:29.22 that's I'm presenting the problem with which we

00:22:33.01 will come up with the solution for we have to we have to figure out how to

00:22:36.05 enhance these gloves in other ways we can do that we can do that no I think

00:22:39.23 there's a way we can I think this way we can improve upon the glove I don't know

00:22:43.10 what it is yet but now my mind is off to the races so I'll get back to you guys

00:22:46.12 in a few days I assume you'll have something too by then so you're taking

00:22:49.14 gloves which protect your hands from multiple different things and you're

00:22:52.22 making a version of gloves specifically for fruit yeah fruit gloves

00:22:57.09 hold on let me write this down on my phone so I remember to do it invent fruit

00:23:02.11 he's gonna look at this in two hours and

00:23:04.20 go what the [ __ ] is fruit gloves why did I write this thing

00:23:08.08 yeah well I wrote invent fruit gloves so it's it like gets a full sentence

00:23:12.17 I got it huh I'll be fine I think you got this

00:23:15.20 maybe like padding on the fingertips a little little sausage there's a lot of

00:23:18.23 that's it yeah there's a lot for every fruit it's

00:23:21.05 like there's a lot of variation too and how you retreat well that's going to be

00:23:24.09 a part of the thing it's like there's a lot of different fruits and I assume

00:23:27.10 different fruits have different needs you know so I'll have to spend some time

00:23:30.12 thinking about about the particularities of each fruit

00:23:34.12 and how to how to get the most out of it like

00:23:36.11 are the needs of a grape the same as the needs of an orange no so how does the

00:23:40.13 glove uh help bring both uh to their flavor forefront we'll have to

00:23:45.07 figure that out it's like when you're buying a cable or something and it tells

00:23:49.20 you what compatible like devices it has I want to buy gloves that they like

00:23:54.10 can't be used with cherries right right I want to know what the specifics are

00:23:58.19 for these things these gloves don't support 4k

00:24:01.02 right these are these are pear and mango gloves they don't do not open a banana

00:24:05.08 with these gloves it'll go badly yeah like you yeah absolutely we are rated

00:24:09.19 for different fruits we are one or two ideas away from having a fantastic

00:24:14.07 kick starter scam of like it can tell the ripeness when you touch it get the most

00:24:19.18 fresh fruit oh that's great wi-fi enabled this is great we got a complete scam

00:24:24.19 that we can we love this yeah are you guys kiwi skin peelers or eaters

00:24:31.01 oh uh neither ah I'm a peeler I guess I'm not crazy about kiwi's skin

00:24:37.18 I do peel but only once you peel once yeah like I'll get a spoon

00:24:42.15 and then I will take the top off and then I will just eat the innards without

00:24:48.02 peeling anything else yeah that's how I used to kiwi now I ate a kiwi like an

00:24:51.14 apple and uh it's just the same hairiness yeah how do you eat an apple

00:24:56.08 uh as Eric would peel a on orange just bite in like a grenade got it all right

00:25:02.13 kiwis are very throw able they'd make for great grenades if there's gonna be a

00:25:07.03 grenade fruit I think I'd go kiwi you got weight but it's not too heavy pretty

00:25:12.21 small though probably a small explosion well that doesn't necessarily equate

00:25:16.14 does it size of thing to explosion you think like a smaller thing will have

00:25:21.12 a bigger explosion well I think it could potentially I'm just saying that you

00:25:24.19 just because it's small doesn't mean the explosion won't be big that's true I'm

00:25:28.15 also saying that like I'm basing this off of action movies I've seen so I

00:25:32.18 don't I don't think that that's an accurate representation of what the

00:25:35.23 thing is I think a lot of the time is like the chain reaction explosions is

00:25:39.15 like how many pounds of [ __ ] you've put

00:25:41.09 in there I guess you just changed what's in there that's true very valid point

00:25:46.12 you know that chicken soup for the soul makes movies

00:25:49.02 you know what they're doing not that we're a movie podcast but

00:25:52.19 they exist still and they make movie I watch this movie I know we're not a

00:25:56.21 movie what are the move here I'll just post a thing can you just

00:26:01.14 post a link to the movie yeah I'm going to they may like is that like a

00:26:06.04 like a gak movie or something no I thought it was a joke so this is a movie

00:26:11.00 I watched earlier this week called willie's wonderland with Nicholas cage

00:26:14.18 and the premier yeah it's like the five nights kind of yeah or something yeah

00:26:18.12 it's like a guy going through town and he has to clean an arcade and the

00:26:22.08 machines come to life and he has to kill them it opened with a chicken soup for

00:26:28.00 the soul production I was like is this a joke and uh no they make movies what a

00:26:32.08 chicken soup for the soul normally do oh they're like self-help books yeah okay

00:26:37.02 huge I forgot they existed but they were massive when I was growing up like the

00:26:41.09 90s it was a big thing like the evolution of brands they make dog food

00:26:46.21 now it's very weird no idea they existed yet no chicken soup for the stomach

00:26:50.17 seems like a no-brainer

00:26:56.00 [ __ ]

00:26:58.19 I didn't have another thing happen uh not my fault but we've been discovered

00:27:04.08 by a different group and uh this is a weird one it's not you can't

00:27:08.13 blame I know 30 cream is not my fault uh so I've talked a lot about my hubby's

00:27:14.21 bagels we love them they're great yeah great business very sweet I don't think

00:27:20.05 I've ever mentioned on the show that the cupcake place I like a wee cup

00:27:25.04 cakery is like a 20-second walk from my hubby's bagels oh did you always kill

00:27:29.13 two birds with one stone I I will often do both things but I've just I don't

00:27:34.02 know it's never really come up in my mind and uh so my mom was recently buying

00:27:39.12 something from the cupcakery place and uh she knows the lady that that runs it

00:27:44.06 and they're still back and forth and the

00:27:47.16 woman said I was so funny I had somebody in here earlier today

00:27:51.20 uh who came here purely just because of a podcast um

00:27:55.12 that that they listen to that they really enjoy

00:27:58.12 and my mom was like oh what was the podcast and like uh it's uh they didn't

00:28:02.13 want to say the name and then my mom was like did they also mention my

00:28:06.22 hubby's bagels a lot she said yeah they also mentioned that that they go to my

00:28:10.17 hubby's bagels all the time too so they now know we exist they know face is a

00:28:14.14 thing and she's like yeah I listened to an episode to like to hear the mention

00:28:18.20 of the thing because we've mentioned it before I've never been more terrified

00:28:22.20 because the thing that came to mind immediately for me is when I dropped the

00:28:28.00 cupcake on the floor oh yeah the cupcake

00:28:31.07 floor saga and now knowing that like she knows who I am

00:28:34.02 and she knows she just next time I go in there there's a possibility that she

00:28:39.22 will know that I ate one of her cupcakes that I dropped on the floor

00:28:43.10 and that's a level of monster that I don't want to deal with in my personal

00:28:47.10 life in like a real way so I'm kind of scared to go back in yeah I'm going to

00:28:51.14 agree nick nick wrote uh in the chat uh what a ringing endorsement for them

00:28:56.02 though I could come on incredible like so good you'll eat it

00:28:59.13 off the floor but then I didn't flow this was this happened like last week so

00:29:04.15 I don't know if if they just listened to a recent episode or

00:29:09.14 if they somehow they heard that specific episode but I don't know how you'd even

00:29:13.18 find that episode because I know I don't feel like it's ever been named so I

00:29:17.04 don't know what the details are but there's a possibility that next time I

00:29:20.06 go in she will know that I ate a cupcake off the floor here's what you do you

00:29:23.18 dazzle and distract her before she has an opportunity for it to register I got

00:29:28.13 an idea for you you love my hubby's bagels you love this cupcake

00:29:32.06 store right what is a cupcake a a yummy delicious cylinder what is a bagel a

00:29:37.14 circle with a hole in the middle you convince her that they need to create a

00:29:41.12 some sort of a pop-up crossover event like like savage fendi where they where

00:29:46.07 they make a cupcake that you stick in a bagel and you call it the bagel cake and

00:29:50.21 then it'll be all over everywhere I like bitten left and right today but

00:29:56.13 you get her so excited about that that that

00:29:58.23 floor eating cupcake incident will be so far in the rearview mirror it'll it'll

00:30:04.02 never pop up again that's a great point I've googled

00:30:07.14 face cupcake story and I've been taken to a Reddit post that says psa don't eat

00:30:13.18 while listening to today's face oh no yeah which is from

00:30:17.22 I don't have to see oh April 14th 2021

00:30:21.08 yeah that yeah it's pretty easy to find that's unfortunate

00:30:26.01 Geoff I like your idea people's disgust I was thinking that I might just need to

00:30:30.02 glue another mustache to my face when I go in like no I think

00:30:33.23 I think you give them you dangle something in front of them that's more

00:30:37.12 exciting than the embarrassment of the cupcake eating and then you just leap

00:30:41.22 frog ahead of it okay I'll go with that approach I'll keep you.

00:34:44.21 you would not think a bunch of toilet stories would include an endorsement of

00:34:50.00 cupcakes

00:34:52.00 oh no I'm so [ __ ] I can't go back no you might know that it's over

00:35:00.12 [ __ ] your mom's gonna be doing a lot of shopping for you

00:35:05.14 would you need to change about your appearance until it was like

00:35:10.04 Clark Kent levels of disguise where it's not ridiculous but people aren't seeing

00:35:14.13 you that's tough because I'm not you know what actually very minimal as a not

00:35:19.18 paych guy I think I throw a pair of pants on nobody's gonna think

00:35:24.10 that's a good point as a no pants no hat guy throw a hat on

00:35:28.19 throw some pants there's no way zero percent chance

00:35:33.05 I I saw the best comment uh recently it was

00:35:36.12 talking about your keyboard saga and how it's very strange that you could see a

00:35:41.17 woman pissing from like hundreds of feet away out your window but you can't see

00:35:46.19 the f row of keys very different circumstances

00:35:50.01 dude speaking of comments can I could I take a second to mention uh absolutely a

00:35:55.04 Reddit post I saw the other day that and also speaking of endorsements I think

00:35:59.14 this is an endorsement for the power of Gavin did you see the thing posted in

00:36:05.12 the face subreddit by this poor guy the username is bob from Boston

00:36:09.21 uh his thread was gavin's bad luck red sox

00:36:14.00 and then he wrote in June the Boston red sox were one of the hottest teams in

00:36:18.03 baseball with a record of 20 and six for the month uh united baseball fan Gavin

00:36:22.15 daley that's a very good record 20 wins six losses uh after Gavin first brought

00:36:26.16 up his sock dilemma on June 29th the red sox have been one of the worst teams in

00:36:32.19 baseball finishing July with a record of eight wins and 19 losses coincident I

00:36:38.12 think Gavin has somehow jinxed the team without even knowing it this is how real

00:36:43.18 this curse is you are you've taken down a 120 year old

00:36:47.03 baseball franchise they haven't been curt you know how long it took them to get

00:36:52.04 over their last curse it took them like 70 years to get past the last curse

00:36:56.12 Jesus Christ dude these socks are gonna be powerful they're gonna be a big deal

00:37:01.16 I was thinking because we were talking about doing the thing where I curse 100

00:37:05.14 pairs of socks or something and I'll sign a little thing to go with them and

00:37:09.12 I'm thinking of using the red socks that I have in the curse I'm thinking of

00:37:14.04 putting those on my hands yeah I'm not waving them over the other socks to

00:37:18.19 spread the curse but I think I have to use the sauce

00:37:22.19 so Eric and I were having a conversation yesterday

00:37:25.03 about this exact thing and we were gonna bring it to you we want to do a like a

00:37:31.01 one-hour live stream where you curse all the socks live

00:37:34.04 I want people to see and I'm really glad

00:37:36.23 that you brought up wearing the socks on your hands yeah that's exciting

00:37:40.15 because visually for an hour as we slide

00:37:43.11 socks in front of you and you curse them it's gonna be really good content I

00:37:47.07 think people are like truly we're gonna see how long it takes for you to curse I

00:37:51.18 mean all these socks I mean I think it should be taken

00:37:54.14 seriously I don't think it's going to be

00:37:56.17 very funny watching me do this this is a

00:37:56.17 it's going to be a it's going to be real we're going to have some other stuff

00:38:00.20 we're going to have some other stuff going on we're going to get a mannequin

00:38:04.08 and we're gonna put the tuxedo on the mannequin which by the way uh I saw I

00:38:07.20 went into eric's office today and I saw the tuxedo with my own eyes uh it exists

00:38:12.15 where is this office that Eric has what's in stage four uh and so uh I uh

00:38:18.13 uh we're gonna we're gonna put the tuxedo on a on a dress form or on a on a

00:38:24.01 mannequin and then we're gonna take a polaroid every time you curse a pair of

00:38:27.20 socks I'm gonna take a polaroid picture of the tuxedo and then give that away

00:38:32.01 with the socks so that everybody gets their own polaroid picture of the tuxedo

00:38:35.13 how [ __ ] cool is that yeah I didn't see how they're related at

00:38:39.01 all but that is what's like the bonus to throw I mean

00:38:43.01 I'm with Gavin but I'm also with Geoff you know what I mean yeah

00:38:47.00 they call it a sweetener yeah I like it I'm into it I want to share I want to

00:38:50.13 share the tuxedo with people as soon as possible and this is the first way I

00:38:53.21 could think of in the in the merch thread on slack tony posted a like a

00:38:58.19 mock-up of the cursed socks and then maxi from

00:39:02.09 social chimed in and said will you be selling uncursed versions

00:39:07.03 I really want those socks but I'm superstitious

00:39:10.22 so I just said I well I basically wanted to say no like there's no there's not

00:39:14.21 gonna be any uncursed versions uh but I promised I would do a very mild curse on

00:39:20.21 hers yeah can I I guess that's can I ask this do you think that you

00:39:25.09 using your red socks to curse these other red socks

00:39:29.12 will dissipate the cursed nature of your socks like you're like passing smaller

00:39:35.05 curses onto these other socks and it's like stealing power so you end up with

00:39:39.12 just like socks that you're able to wear by I this might be a cleanse because it

00:39:43.17 is diluting across all pairs so I'll be using my red socks to decurs well I'll

00:39:48.23 be decursing my red socks onto the red socks right but yeah maybe

00:39:53.09 a side effect of that well that the red sox as a team would get worse hmm

00:39:58.01 I this is an interesting thought I think it's important you do cover your hands

00:40:01.18 because there could be a real battle of the curse because you're not you're

00:40:06.15 you're known as the boy with the golden hands right so if you need to cover

00:40:11.04 those literal golden hands with some red socks so that way you're not you're not

00:40:16.00 blessing them you could be cursing and then blessing depending on how you pass

00:40:20.08 it off it's important your hands are covered that's all I'm saying

00:40:24.19 so stupid and I don't know I I don't know what that's going to look like for

00:40:30.08 an hour it's like at least a 25-second job dude

00:40:34.06 we'll do other stuff we'll do other stuff we'll make it an event we'll like

00:40:38.01 I'll put together a full show you can even be off to the side and we can just

00:40:41.11 cut over to you every once in a while let's check in on how gavin's doing kind

00:40:44.23 of thing if you want you know I'm sure we can fill an hour with other stuff uh

00:40:50.10 god knows there's a million different dumb things we could do and yeah

00:40:54.02 we should say I mean obviously it's all [ __ ] it's all a lot of shite

00:40:58.02 but I I will genuinely feel bad if someone dies wearing these cursed socks

00:41:02.04 but I don't know what to do about that like that was

00:41:04.20 it's not real but we've had instances where predictions have been made and

00:41:08.13 some weird [ __ ] happens and you know we just gotta be I gotta be

00:41:12.01 careful how would you know I don't kill someone but how do you know if that

00:41:15.23 happened

00:41:17.22 let's just hope that the person that bought them the socks dies in the same

00:41:22.23 accident so there'll be no way for the information to get back to us

00:41:28.12 with the socks comes a card that gets stuck

00:41:30.10 in your wallet so when they find your body it will just have instructions on

00:41:34.14 like firstly check out what colored socks I'm wearing if I'm wearing these

00:41:38.04 red socks please call this number just so we can know no how dangerous these

00:41:43.09 socks are we'll put that no I like this because we'll just put a sign behind the

00:41:47.00 tuxedo and you just keep your polaroid in your wallet

00:41:50.18 so that way you have a picture of the tuxedo and also a sign that says if I'm

00:41:55.08 dead and wearing red socks here's who contact Gavin free I don't understand

00:42:00.03 why you did this why what do you mean well because this opened with you be

00:42:03.19 like oh I really hope this doesn't happen and I bring up it's an

00:42:06.22 impossibility for you to know and then you're like okay well let's make it

00:42:10.00 possible let's make sure that I do know if it does happen well he likes to solve

00:42:13.19 the world of ignorance why don't we just

00:42:16.02 say don't wear them don't wear the socks

00:42:18.04 well I think we're doing that regardless yeah do you think people

00:42:22.21 do you think people would wear them dude knowing the risks dude

00:42:26.18 that kid that came to rt Monday night on the podcast to eat frozen spaghetti is

00:42:31.06 eating that [ __ ] spaghetti and that spaghetti is like a year and a half old

00:42:34.16 and has been frozen and unfrozen like nine times so yeah I think people will

00:42:38.15 wear the socks if anything I assume you got some red

00:42:41.12 spaghetti sauce in that mix it's the power of red it would if anything

00:42:45.11 enhance the flavor I would assume why don't we have any current comment

00:42:50.04 leavers uh just let us know whether you'd be buying these socks to own or to

00:42:53.20 wear or both there you go hey gabo I had an idea I wanted I wanted to run by you

00:42:58.12 uh I mean android applies to you as well we'd have to figure out how to work it

00:43:01.16 in but you know how you were talking the

00:43:03.10 other day about when we filmed sbi um we were talking about how much fun it was

00:43:08.04 for you and I to be in an office together again and

00:43:12.19 uh how creatively uh inspiring it was and I was thinking what if we had you

00:43:17.04 know because we're both busy boys and there's not a lot we have a lot going on

00:43:20.12 there's not a lot of free time what if we tried to earmark one day a month that

00:43:24.19 it was face office day and we go and we spend

00:43:28.08 the whole day in an office together maybe with Eric too uh if he's got time

00:43:32.05 and then we can always pip in Andrew somehow and we just have to from like

00:43:35.08 nine to five we're required to be at work together in an office and only

00:43:39.14 focusing on face oh I'd love that one whatever happens

00:43:42.16 happens one day a month I mean maybe we could expand we can expand if it's

00:43:46.04 successful and we get good stuff out of it and we don't hate each other but like

00:43:49.15 one day a month we just for nine hours we go and we just walk and talk and

00:43:54.00 speak face and whatever comes out of that day comes out of that day let me

00:43:57.10 propose this because I don't know what everyone's schedule is like but what if

00:44:00.20 we do like a second Thursday of every month Thursday's already our episode

00:44:05.07 recording day so why don't we just build that in and

00:44:08.23 we do like a second or a third Thursday of every month and that's just like the

00:44:13.08 day and that's what we got we got I think it's dangerous to do on a

00:44:16.19 day that we're recording yeah I think Gavin will like that because it's

00:44:19.19 technically pleasantries for the thing anymore well plus we I don't wanna I

00:44:23.04 don't wanna see him when we record so I don't have to go home.

00:44:27.09 I like it I like are we doing it like on a Friday then is that

00:44:31.09 I could do Friday okay Friday Andrew yeah it doesn't matter to me I

00:44:36.15 don't care I don't care what's the best day for you Eric uh

00:44:41.01 uh Thursday but I can make friday's work

00:44:43.09 what about you nick what's your best day

00:44:46.02 okay we can make friends like what if we do like every like third

00:44:50.14 Friday uh every month and it's like like

00:44:53.05 so this month it would be the 19th if we were to actually do it which I don't

00:44:56.12 think we can this month but um like we could make that work I [ __ ]

00:45:00.20 love that I think this is awesome I think face will benefit hopefully

00:45:06.13 you could just do stuff that yeah like instead of I mean to try to like

00:45:11.17 schedule an mvp too like we could just know like oh we got Friday yeah right

00:45:15.04 right we're like we gotta hit some we gotta hit some baseballs gotta bury

00:45:18.05 beans like yeah yeah absolutely this will get our [ __ ] off the weekends

00:45:22.06 yeah yes big time and and I I really like this idea I think building a day in

00:45:26.23 where we can all be together and do that is a lot of fun too because we can grab

00:45:31.20 the other pieces that we need and just sort of like

00:45:34.04 tell everyone to [ __ ] off we have this thing and also Friday works because no

00:45:38.05 one's working on Friday anyway it's fine that's true that's true

00:45:43.03 and and you can hear you can hardly call what we're about to do work so it fits

00:45:47.00 slots in perfectly on a Friday very true speaking of which we we should really I

00:45:51.14 know we're we just talked about scheduling a whole day but uh

00:45:55.07 we should probably try to figure out that mvp thing soon too because we're

00:45:58.22 starting to okay what are you doing okay what are you doing on the 12th

00:46:03.07 uh let me see hold on let me look at my calendar uh

00:46:06.01 yeah man I think I can do the 12th I could also do anytime tomorrow or this

00:46:10.13 weekend

00:46:13.01 off the um I have I know I know I don't want to do anything on a Saturday or

00:46:18.00 something do you have a life yeah the 12th things I have things to do stuff

00:46:23.05 other stuff I'm good for the 12th all right mvp2 on the 12th I'm excited hang

00:46:55.05 want to make this like a midday thing or like a morning thing like what works

00:46:59.01 best for you I I just want the tech to be figured out

00:47:03.00 I wouldn't mind what if we started our day with it we had a morning monkey

00:47:07.11 movie and we ate breakfast while we watched it so what what time is it

00:47:12.20 because it's two hours difference for where Andrew is uh let's say 11 a.m our

00:47:18.00 time 9 a.m andrew's time monkey mornings monkey morning movie fantastic okay

00:47:24.13 I can't imagine watching that movie at night I'm ready to watch it anytime

00:47:30.12 we could start now I'd be happy 5am any hour is an appropriate time to

00:47:35.09 watch mvp2 I need to record the setup thing then right because I I

00:47:41.03 you wanted me to do a recap of the first movie to fill you in on the lore going

00:47:46.11 into the second one I wanted to edit I gotta do that

00:47:50.10 I'll record that that's good Geoff has a uh

00:47:53.18 looks like a meeting at 11 a.m but I put it there anyway so that's good what the

00:47:59.20 [ __ ] what is my meeting at 11 a.m all right let's go through this

00:48:02.20 yeah no we didn't no hey yeah Gavin yeah Gavin yes we did oh yeah because I

00:48:07.01 haven't I haven't accepted that meeting yet it hasn't been accepted so

00:48:10.16 uh I haven't said yes to it so I can say

00:48:12.10 no to it yeah done okay you're gonna say no you're gonna say maybe to it like no

00:48:16.11 I just said yes to the monkey thing okay

00:48:19.05 yeah it's way more important did we talk about how you said the wrong year last

00:48:23.10 week yeah I should have said year three but it was yeah I said year two but it

00:48:26.14 was have you been saying year three or did you no no I just [ __ ] up in that

00:48:30.23 moment they got me flustered and I got all [ __ ] up uh hey gav when we were

00:48:36.05 when we were in that office together during the sbi I told you a story

00:48:41.12 that I had neglected to tell on the podcast because I thought it was too gross

00:48:46.01 and you told me you didn't think it was too gross and that I should tell that

00:48:49.07 story oh god I think it's grosser than Andrew eating a bathroom floor cupcake I

00:48:53.21 was a low though that's like that was a low

00:48:57.12 that was a low well this is a low for me too

00:49:00.12 um the reason I ask is because I have an update to that story a while back uh

00:49:07.11 this summer before sbi we were filming I don't remember I think it was in June

00:49:14.00 I was doing a lot of swimming this is uh personally embarrassing

00:49:18.15 uh and I don't know why because it's totally fine but I was doing a lot of

00:49:23.18 swimming and uh I started to get like a uh like some dry

00:49:28.08 scratchy skin on my thigh like right next to my balls

00:49:32.12 and I thought it was just uh I thought like maybe I'm using the blow dryer too

00:49:35.23 much when I go to the dryer I don't know what it is

00:49:38.11 but uh it just started to get like more and more irritated and then one morning

00:49:42.15 I looked I woke up and it had spread and

00:49:45.01 it was like all down my thigh and it was like kind of up on the front above like

00:49:50.00 my dick shelf kind of area and uh and it was getting like really painful

00:49:54.12 to touch and I was like what the [ __ ]

00:49:56.21 and so I was embarrassed that I showed Emily and she was like oh you probably

00:50:00.10 got like jock itch or something and I was like I can't have that I've never

00:50:03.16 had that in my entire life even in five years in the army I never got jock itch

00:50:07.12 that's disgusting uh how does one even get that what is jock itch and uh also

00:50:11.20 yes I'm no jock I mean yeah I can swing a baseball but baseball bat but

00:50:15.19 and so I thought well I I I spent a couple days just putting like loturman

00:50:20.01 on it and it kept getting worse to the point where I couldn't

00:50:23.22 it was painful to wear clothes and so I went to my doctor and I had to

00:50:28.19 show my doctor my business and he was like whoa

00:50:31.12 you've got some j you got a hell of a case of jock itch buddy and I was like

00:50:35.12 I've never had that before and he was like well if he he's like it happens a

00:50:39.16 lot more often than you'd think it's a normal thing

00:50:42.16 it's uh he goes if you're if you're if you're outside a lot when it's hot

00:50:46.07 you're sweating you know stuff gets a little musty it's very easy for it to

00:50:50.06 grow there do you swim a lot and I was like I swim all the time I'm jet skiing

00:50:53.08 all the time I'm in pools bar ton springs all the time he's like you got it you

00:50:56.16 got it from that just like it's like a [ __ I thing yeah I guess it's like a

00:51:00.11 fungal thing it's like athlete's [ __ ]

00:51:02.05 it's like it's the same thing as athlete's foot just on your uh just

00:51:06.02 another another area I think it's like the exact same fungus oh man

00:51:09.18 and so he was like you know what you do is like just bring an extra pair of

00:51:13.00 shorts and just change out of the wetlands and the dry ones whenever you

00:51:16.10 get out of the water and then he gave me some prescription medicine

00:51:19.07 that I had to put on it I was lucky and that my daughter was out of town for

00:51:24.15 like 10 straight days because it got so inflamed and it was so bad that for nine

00:51:29.23 days I didn't wear shorts or underwear or pants I walked around I I air I

00:51:35.07 Andrew panton did I Donald ducked it just in a t-shirt a t I wore a t-shirt

00:51:40.17 and socks only I didn't leave the house for nine days as I beat down this

00:51:45.11 horrible jock itch and I bring it up I brought it up together and I was like I

00:51:49.15 think this probably too close too gross to tell but I did record three episodes

00:51:54.13 of face during it like completely naked sitting

00:51:58.06 in the chair like with a jock itch medicine cream all over my legs just an

00:52:03.14 agony I was recorded an episode one week and

00:52:07.12 then we recorded a two fur the next week and uh the entire time I was just like

00:52:12.05 flaming hot jock itch just in agonizing pain anyway and then

00:52:16.10 eventually it they said it would go away it went away and uh

00:52:21.08 and when I got the prescription from the that's the worst cheetos flavor nick

00:52:26.02 said uh the flamin hot jacket when uh when I got that prescription

00:52:31.07 from the uh from the pharmacy the pharmacist goes

00:52:34.19 you're gonna need more than this and I go what do you mean he goes they didn't

00:52:37.19 prescribe you enough this stuff is persistent and I was like okay

00:52:40.20 pharmacist whatever the doctor [ __ ] told me this would be enough and

00:52:45.06 uh and I bring that up because you know this all got beaten back in like my

00:52:49.14 mid-July it was gone I was totally fine and uh

00:52:53.01 guess who woke up with jock itch this morning oh no

00:52:55.22 it's back in attendance no whatever so the trilogy of face episodes where

00:53:01.01 you've got knob out knob rot is now a quadrilogy there's now a fourth episode

00:53:06.13 is your [ __ ] out right now no no I'm wearing shorts uh it's not like so bad I

00:53:11.06 can't wear clothes uh but uh I already had to call in the prescription on as

00:53:14.15 soon as we're done here I got to go to cvs and get more jacket stuff

00:53:18.12 I can't [ __ ] believe it and I'm going to I'm going to tell the story because a

00:53:21.13 Gavin said uh that it's not too gross to

00:53:24.17 tell b because I want to raise awareness for jock itch it's a terrible

00:53:28.14 tragedy that's befalls upon people all over the world and it doesn't mean that

00:53:32.06 they're grossly gross people it may just mean that they like to swim a lot and

00:53:36.13 it's 110 degrees in Texas all the time so stop jocket shaming who is

00:53:44.02 no it's a thing I'm aware of it it sucks so bad

00:53:48.13 knob out knob rot this is stuck in my head Gavin said I can't it's got no bra

00:53:54.15 no my knob is fine it's not on my knob it's just on my thighs and the area

00:53:59.13 around the knob the worst iteration of fraggle rock

00:54:03.02 knob rod the worst the worst part about this is is that I got the jock itch

00:54:08.04 three weeks before my vasectomy and so it cleared up

00:54:12.15 like it cleared up I was sweating it because I didn't want to like not be

00:54:17.16 able to get my vasectomy so it cleared up like the week of the

00:54:22.15 vasectomy and then I got my vasectomy so I basically haven't been able to

00:54:26.00 sexually use my stuff in like oh it was like over a month

00:54:30.01 because I had like jock itch right into the vasectomy recovery and then now that

00:54:34.18 I'm finally feeling better you know I'm two and a half weeks past the vasectomy

00:54:40.19 the jock itch just like like hello hello just guys I'm back

00:54:46.00 the second it clears up they're straight in there with a scalpel

00:54:51.05 I'm gonna have like in this period three months of an unusable crotch

00:54:55.16 it just sucks [Laughter]

00:54:59.03 just [ __ ] sucks how do I avoid it I'm worried about this yeah it's I don't

00:55:05.01 know like humidity

00:55:10.17 or some [ __ ] oh does it yeah I think so I think there's like

00:55:15.11 what doesn't what does gold one gives you cancer

00:55:20.08 falcon powder and cancer yeah see it's rough [Laughter]

00:55:25.09 all right feels like a thing you'd have to pull

00:55:29.02 out of the operation guy it's the knob right section we [Laughter]

00:55:46.13 oh man big long back right oh yeah the mouth is just like just

00:55:52.17 you go near the face and the mouth just lights up

00:55:56.06 I mean we all everyone here has lower body problems gavin's got cursed socks I

00:56:02.01 got unusable ankles you got the crotch crotch rod yeah I don't know how you

00:56:05.08 expect are you going to be able to do this end cap challenge with yeah

00:56:09.07 absolutely no I'm good I'm all good now and the marathon

00:56:12.10 that is like a distant thought I'm just we gotta as Geoff said crawl before we

00:56:17.12 run right but that was our point when you brought it up in the first place you

00:56:23.01 were so far from the marathon when it came out of your mouth it was yeah

00:56:28.17 you're right as a burger confidence remove a shampoo bottle from the butt.

00:56:34.17 [Laughter]

00:56:36.17 Open up gavin's airway so he doesn't fart to death

00:56:40.00 I like the idea of having to remove the shampoo bottle from the butt but every

00:56:44.04 game ships without that piece like it was never enough this is the empty slot

00:56:49.09 oh man you fix your farting Gavin you start fire problems

00:56:53.14 uh the cpap is unplugged in a corner still can't bring your softer I want to

00:56:58.12 wait until I've had some decent sleep before I start ruining my sleep that's

00:57:02.16 my that's fine how are you ever going to get sleep

00:57:05.11 unless you decent sleep unless you figure out this cpap problem

00:57:09.00 it is a double edge it's a good point didn't you start the seat back because

00:57:12.19 you should have a good night's sleep yeah that is very sick yep

00:57:17.22 oh get up you ever wake you I was gonna end

00:57:21.05 never mind never mind but I said good app that wasn't yesterday yeah wrap up

00:57:26.02 yeah we're done you got more stuff why is that a small thing but it's fine we

00:57:29.09 should wrap up this is good I feel like you just destroyed the end of the

00:57:31.01 podcast we haven't created an hour why don't you redeem it with your small

00:57:35.00 thing no it's just a smile it's gonna because we brought it before

00:57:38.12 Geoff you woke up on [ __ ] and I was like ah that's a terrible way to come

00:57:41.12 out of sleep have you ever woken yourself up from farting relationship

00:57:45.07 with Gavin said oh yeah I don't think I've ever had it

00:57:49.22 happen until like last week I woke my I startled myself because I farted it was

00:57:54.12 a massive it wasn't lot it was just powerful I think it was the most

00:57:57.20 powerful fart I've ever had powerful how like it if it wasn't loud how is it

00:58:03.03 powerful like you moved the other way yeah no like the sheet move like if we

00:58:06.20 if there was a baseball between my legs that ball would have went 80. We would

00:58:10.12 have hit Geoff's goal it was how far would a shampoo bottle have going oh a

00:58:14.15 different country easily it would have went north all the way to Texas

00:58:19.11 hands down easily so it was like a lot of pressure I think

00:58:22.15 it was like a little more like a bassy fart than a lion we're at the point now

00:58:27.14 where we can communicate almost entirely in face references

00:58:31.01 because it's a language

00:58:34.02 it's just startling so it's curious if you guys have had it happen to you it

00:58:37.18 was it was an alarming thing I was in a great sleep and then all of a sudden my

00:58:41.10 ass essentially exploded uh no I think I've woken up with the full feeling of

00:58:45.22 needing to but I don't think I've I don't think I've actually woke myself up

00:58:49.02 with one yeah it's curious because I do you the cpap problems and then you're

00:58:53.04 bloated I was curious if it ever happened if that's how you woke up I

00:58:58.02 would be [ __ ] awesome especially if it was like one of those

00:59:00.15 45 second cpap farts like you wake up in the part and then you're still

00:59:04.22 farting and then you fully come too and you're still fine

00:59:10.06 you can just hear him going further away because it's so constant

00:59:14.23 slowly slowly going [Music]

00:59:20.04 oh well you've done it again audience you made it to the end of an episode of

00:59:49.14 uh that's the the bare minimum you could be doing to promote this show you could

00:59:53.11 try a little harder uh no I'm just kidding don't tell anybody about it uh it

00:59:58.17 doesn't matter either way uh we'll listen to you next time

01:00:01.20 how does it not matter either way well I just felt like I was coming on

01:00:04.21 too strong so that I tried to walk it back a bit I really do want them to tell

01:00:08.04 every single human being on earth there's seven and a

01:00:11.07 half billion people on this planet and most of them don't listen to our podcast

01:00:14.15 and I think there's and I have issues but I don't want to put the onus too

01:00:18.14 much on the audience because then they're going to feel like I'm asking

01:00:21.18 too much of them and I don't want to do that so so I tried to like I realized
