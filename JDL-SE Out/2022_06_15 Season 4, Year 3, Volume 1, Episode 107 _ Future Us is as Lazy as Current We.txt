00:00:00.02 [Music]

00:00:07.22 [Music]

00:00:15.12 Gavin's early I don't know how to feel about this

00:00:18.22 yeah he's a minute early so he said he jumped the gun he left he panicked

00:00:23.18 I was just gonna get into what this episode was or what the last one was so

00:00:28.22 um were you there for the last one Eric yeah the the you were you left the next

00:00:33.13 day I'm sorry I was just trying to ruin the timeline that's fine

00:00:36.18 you're all good we're still waiting for Gavin and then I can get right into it

00:00:39.20 and then it's all up and then it's on you guys another 30 seconds and he

00:00:43.01 should be here just 30 more seconds so if there's any pleasantries you want to

00:00:47.20 get out of the way ah no I I feel pretty good about Geoff anything pleasant

00:00:52.14 I have nothing pleasant to say oh I have nothing unpleasant to say either

00:00:57.09 okay you're just neutral yeah that's good that's that's a important

00:01:00.20 clarification I thought maybe this was going to be like like you were in like a

00:01:04.12 Gavin mood you know like I mean like oh you coming in like a bad now I feel I

00:01:08.15 feel way better than Gavin okay cool I got a quick pleasantry dairy queen has

00:01:13.12 its own like menu in Texas I learned last night I thought that was very weird

00:01:16.22 like they have they operate on a different level in Texas like it has its

00:01:20.21 own slogan it has its own website it's not even originating in Texas no I just

00:01:25.18 I thought that was very strange it sucks for uh face jam it's like oh yeah it's

00:01:30.11 like truly awful and what oh just because like people want you to cover

00:01:33.16 their their oh we went the first time we

00:01:35.20 tried to do dairy queen they didn't have the food so we had to eat oh uh

00:01:41.11 that's great I it was weird I was looking at their mascots because I forgot

00:01:45.08 I saw like an old mr misty ad with Dennis the menace oh yeah they had

00:01:49.12 [ __ ] Dennis the menace was their mascot for a while why yeah what

00:01:54.02 happened with that and he was their mascot from like 77 until 2002 where

00:01:58.20 they were like kids don't know who Dennis the menace is anymore like

00:02:02.14 there's no he is completely irrelevant in the general culturescape let's get a

00:02:08.08 new mascot that's just lips just floating lips that talk like this is strange

00:02:13.13 I will say that Dennis the menace 90s movie with the kid from rush more as

00:02:18.16 Dennis and then I think Walter matthau yes it was Walter uh

00:02:23.10 was [ __ ] awesome I don't know if you guys have seen it lately yes I remember

00:02:27.17 being very very good I don't know if the movie's great but Christopher Lloyd is

00:02:32.12 so [ __ ] scary is the villain in that movie like way beyond what a villain

00:02:37.12 should be in a kid's movie in a kid's movie absolutely he is so [ __ ] creepy

00:02:43.09 remember like mr Wilson was like I feel like the subplot was mr Wilson was like

00:02:47.14 doing horticulture and he was like about to he was about to have a a rare orchid

00:02:52.14 bloom for the first time in like 50

00:02:54.11 years and he was trying to keep Dennis away from doing it does that sound right

00:03:00.08 I mean it does but it also feels like the plot to an nes game

00:03:04.13 like it feels the same we just had this kind of like similar conversation

00:03:09.23 in face jam because we just had uh dairy

00:03:12.02 queen and the thing that I brought up is that Dennis the there's two Dennis the

00:03:16.02 menaces um didn't we talk about this on the show

00:03:20.13 that there's like a British Dennis the menace that has nothing to do with the

00:03:26.08 other Dennis they just coincidentally existed at the same time that's news to

00:03:31.04 me look we talked about

00:03:40.08 look at his little gremlin dog I think I think I would remember if we talked

00:03:45.09 about it on this right well now that Gavin is late like look at this [ __ ]

00:03:50.23 thing what is like look at this like I'm pretty sure hey Gavin yeah

00:03:55.20 what's up buddy oh my mic was reset all right so I put in all my do I sound the

00:03:59.12 same yeah that's so great you sound fine

00:04:01.12 you sound flustered because you're three minutes late are we talking uh we're

00:04:04.12 talking the be a no we're talking Dennis the menace what's going on okay so this

00:04:09.11 is episode 107 the last episode was all about uh

00:04:12.11 uh a home vibe inspector uh how to buy a

00:04:15.06 house getting trench foot in the bathtub uh the big bad werewolf and the jackass

00:04:20.19 too spicy icy so uh this is episode 107 go nuts we talked

00:04:23.22 about the Dennis the menace thing before right Gavin on the show the British

00:04:27.06 Dennis the menace which I don't know how Dennis the menace was invented one day

00:04:31.00 apart from Dennis the menace we've talked about this on here before

00:04:34.23 we've never had this conversation Eric said they talked about it on face jam I

00:04:38.15 don't remember this these pictures are ever talking about this maybe I don't

00:04:41.21 think we did photos maybe this wasn't like I talked about it

00:04:44.08 nick doesn't remember it either maybe it was like a po you guys talked about it

00:04:48.00 in the post I remember as a kid seeing uh clips from the movie and

00:04:52.13 wondering why they cast like a little blonde kid as Dennis the venice where he

00:04:58.06 looks absolutely nothing and I was like where the hell is nasha

00:05:02.00 his name's nasher the little dog the little dog's nasher that's a great name

00:05:06.12 for a dog uh Eric wants us to do an intro and nick said yeah oh no he's

00:05:10.23 saying yeah look at his teeth I thought he was like aggressively supporting

00:05:16.00 hello and welcome to episode 107 of the F**kFuckFacePodcast my name is Geoff Ramsey with

00:05:21.04 me as always Gavin free Andrew pen ton in

00:05:23.23 no particular order I like and hate them the exact same amount uh not playing no

00:05:30.02 favorites to play there uh this is year three finally no

00:05:33.19 see yeah [ __ ] yeah year three yeah for a while season season four year three

00:05:38.16 volume one episode 107.

00:05:40.12 I will say the intros faced me recently and also in

00:05:44.11 an unexpected way somebody reached out and said that we skipped an episode

00:05:50.19 number that we went from like 86 to 88

00:05:53.09 and I was like that that'd be funny if that was true if we had been one week

00:05:57.07 off this entire time that would be great so then I went to confirm it and our

00:06:01.17 intros are all over the [ __ ] place and it was a nightmare to try

00:06:12.04 sound board please nick if you could clip that for me I'll need that for the

00:06:17.05 break show oh it's like okay is it in the beginning or

00:06:21.03 is it 35 minutes into this episode I don't know where to look it could be

00:06:25.01 anything yeah you really faced yourself with that Andrew it was unfortunate yeah

00:06:30.00 I don't think he's the most disruptive uh intro person in the in the

00:06:33.22 history of the show you think I'm the disruptive intro person yes I do

00:06:38.03 that's fair I'm not even actually gonna argue that I think that's probably right

00:06:41.14 I don't intentionally mean to be so I'm not gonna fight you on it but uh

00:06:46.06 you argued against intros for like 30

00:06:49.01 episodes I did well because we sometimes talk about like we will continue a

00:06:53.20 conversation in a way I don't know just it felt like we're an unstructured show

00:06:59.05 and the intros felt structured man you know what's hard to talk about is

00:07:02.23 explaining our podcast to strangers I uh I was in uh I was out of town over the

00:07:06.23 weekend doing a convention you know like a day job rich teeth convention type

00:07:10.09 thing yeah and so I was just like signing autographs and sitting at a

00:07:13.20 booth you know like voice actors do and uh

00:07:16.17 I talked to so many regulation listeners actually

00:07:20.13 without a fault almost every I kept like a check mark on the table every time

00:07:25.12 somebody talked about either of the three podcasts I'm on and

00:07:29.11 congratulations face destroyed the other two uh but uh but I will say red versus

00:07:35.22 blue destroyed face it wasn't even [ __ ] close uh

00:07:40.10 but I almost feel like almost everybody who came up to me uh because I made

00:07:44.11 reverse blue like 100 years ago and I make face today but uh almost uh to the

00:07:49.08 t everybody that came up to me said hey I uh you know I I wanted to come up and

00:07:53.01 say I'm a regulation listener but I don't know

00:07:55.12 is does this a comment is having a conversation with you a comment and my

00:07:59.11 comment lever and I had to be like absolutely I know I

00:08:03.03 said no no I said here's what I said I said the two entirely separate things

00:08:06.04 what you are if you come up to me in person and have

00:08:09.02 a conversation with me you're a conversation have her that's totally

00:08:12.05 different that's ridiculous the whole point of a comment leaver is like who

00:08:16.14 leaves comments who goes the other way to actually go and seek out other

00:08:21.03 people's content and leave a comment if they go to you in person that's that's

00:08:24.22 one beyond no but it's not I I feel like a comment needs to be a

00:08:29.01 thing that is in a public space that people can see secondly you're having to

00:08:33.06 make an assumption on motive the person who's talking to Geoff may not have been

00:08:37.08 there to see Geoff specifically and learned he was there while there as the

00:08:41.08 person who coined the term comment leaver Eric I'm gonna need you to chime

00:08:44.13 in on this uh I agree with Gavin this is the same to me as a dm insanity okay

00:08:49.20 it's like a dm hang on I'm not Geoff hang

00:08:52.13 on hang on I'm not done uh it's the same as a dm where somebody is messaging you

00:08:58.00 directly to me it's the same they're commenting about the show they're

00:09:03.00 commenting to you about the thing that they listen to and that's fine be a

00:09:07.12 regulation listener and then you leave a comment you're a comment lever and

00:09:11.14 that's fine but that's what it is no I I

00:09:14.08 don't I I think that that's a a terrible analogy uh there's no such thing as an

00:09:18.02 irl dm you know they're not leaving it anywhere

00:09:20.10 it's like as nick said in the comments there's no paper trail it's going out

00:09:23.15 into the ether it's not being like what you're bringing

00:09:26.19 it could be but you've brought it somewhere you're saying it's not anywhere but

00:09:31.12 you've brought it here oh my god point to where it's written

00:09:36.17 down point to where it's left as someone who used to be a comment

00:09:40.00 leaver a straight up comment leaver on rooster teeth even before it was called

00:09:45.11 that red versus blue.com I was a comment leaver and I went out my way one day to

00:09:50.15 become an in real life person that was the extra step I flew to new york I met

00:09:54.12 you you told everyone my fly was down I'd taken it a step further at that point

00:09:59.05 that's a conversation happening yeah you're just arguing the point you just

00:10:03.18 your entire point is that there's a different layer to it that it's a

00:10:08.23 different thing it's totally different than notes the note's a written

00:10:12.08 conversation it denotes something that's

00:10:14.06 being left for somebody to find later in written form I guess I'm just trying to

00:10:19.12 organize them in a hierarchy I think I don't comment definition a verbal or

00:10:24.23 written remark expressing an opinion or reaction

00:10:27.12 okay that's what I'm saying you can't be you can't be the third one you can't

00:10:32.23 skip number two you go regulation listener you go comment lever and then

00:10:36.11 whatever you talk there's suggestions you've become you've gone through

00:10:40.05 comment lever you've already become one and you're now into the step above it

00:10:44.02 that's my point so if you were walking down the street

00:10:46.23 right and you see Nicholas cage on the side of the road like [ __ ] having a

00:10:51.08 Pepsi and you walk up to him and you go hey Nicholas k I just want to say I

00:10:56.00 really loved con air big fan and he goes thank you are you a comet leaver

00:11:01.12 I'll say this I think it's ludicrous but Eric read the definition of comment and

00:11:07.05 it fits and I'm if if anything I'm a dictionary stickler

00:11:11.09 kid number two yeah dictionary kid I'm a dictionary kid everybody uh that should

00:11:17.11 be plainly obvious just from the tater tot conversation alone so I I gotta go

00:11:21.15 with the dictionary I I will I will aced that point but I still think in the

00:11:25.21 spirit of it it's wrong uh okay so here's the thing everyone keeps saying

00:11:30.03 that like oh comment lever no you're just leaving a comment you've left a

00:11:33.13 comment you've walked by someone and you said this thing you've left a comment

00:11:37.02 and that's fine there's nothing wrong with that

00:11:39.17 there's not just a comment being a comment yeah it's the

00:11:44.06 Gavin that's it that's all it is that's it that's the that's the delineation I

00:11:50.02 would like to just clarify your position Gavin so you think that somebody who

00:11:55.09 talks to Geoff at a convention went there they are

00:11:59.13 in the conversation have her camp but to become a conversation haver you have to

00:12:04.00 walk through comment lever you have to go down the comment leave a path it's

00:12:07.21 like a monopoly position like you have to go past comment lever to advance

00:12:11.20 around the corner there's no there's no chance card that lets you skip comment

00:12:16.00 lever you've you've become one you've left the comment wow okay I really did

00:12:19.22 not expect this to turn into such a hotly debated thing it wasn't even the

00:12:25.14 point of the conversation uh where I was going with it is uh

00:12:29.18 like I'd love to hear what the audience has to say I assumed because we were

00:12:34.02 having a conversation in person we were conversation havers uh if you want to

00:12:37.17 call that a comment leaver I guess they left me a comment and then I returned

00:12:40.18 them with a comment and then they left me another comment and then I comment

00:12:44.03 back and then they comment back and then after 30 or so seconds of exchanging

00:12:48.08 comments they leave and I consider that a conversation but it was really just a

00:12:52.19 branched series of comments when you look at it I guess

00:12:56.07 that fine I'm down with that whatever you guys want uh imagine just think of

00:13:01.11 the comment leaving we're doing right now between the four the five of us this

00:13:06.12 is phenomenal uh however uh the point I was gonna make is you wouldn't believe

00:13:12.12 all the baseballs I signed oh almost more than anything else I signed

00:13:17.12 a bunch of zimmer cards which is as always is an honor and honor to sign a

00:13:23.06 don zimmer card and I signed maybe 15 of them but the thing that people brought

00:13:27.16 up and I signed some shirts I signed some like jet ski apparel I signed some

00:13:32.03 uh like boys of zimmer stuff uh one of the vinyl or one of the

00:13:36.12 we decided it's not a flag it's a banner signed one of those but so many people

00:13:41.04 brought up baseballs now uh three or four people brought up baseballs they

00:13:44.13 were pre-hit by us for like from the sale but a lot of people just brought

00:13:48.13 bought brand new baseballs and just had me sign them and they got me thinking I

00:13:52.09 think we're a baseballs podcast not a baseball podcast but specifically

00:13:58.00 baseballs like the actual tool used in baseball yeah but we've we've done more

00:14:02.00 runs of bats than balls well that's we I have 400 baseballs in my library right

00:14:06.06 now that are waiting to be hit so that won't that won't be the case forever

00:14:09.17 that's fair I mean it eventually would swap I'm just trying to think of what I

00:14:14.23 didn't sign I didn't sign a single baseball bat or otherwise

00:14:19.02 but I signed 35 baseballs probably well it's tough to bring in a bat I feel too

00:14:23.21 convincing are you kidding dude have you seen how many people bring in swords

00:14:27.19 that are 11 feet tall that have shotguns piece bonded on them like

00:14:32.13 everything people bring to a convention is some sort of a fantastical

00:14:36.03 sci-fi weapon that's fair I had a dude bring in a baseball bat as a part of

00:14:41.22 this costume that had uh like railroad ties hammered through it but he didn't

00:14:46.21 ask me to sign it so that doesn't count so that was a legitimate weapon maybe

00:14:52.06 we're a baseball accessories podcast like it's not not the game itself but

00:14:55.15 the equipment required is the football in football an accessory though I feel

00:15:00.04 like it's more it's like the main bit it's a tool of the game whatever the

00:15:04.02 tool the trade I don't remember the wording on that card like a towel tool

00:15:09.03 yeah like a towel yeah it's a tool of the trade for sure

00:15:11.18 I think my favorite part of the whole this is going back to the what what

00:15:16.04 isn't isn't a comment lever my favorite part is just thinking of all of the

00:15:19.13 regulation listeners who know that they can only become a comment leaver once

00:15:23.21 and that it's permanent and they're just keeping that mouth shut and not writing

00:15:28.04 stuff like I don't want to lose status you know what it's like

00:15:32.03 it's like playing a global game of infection

00:15:36.13 it's like someday there's gonna be one there's gonna be one regulation listener

00:15:41.15 left and as soon as we find him and make him talk have a in person comment

00:15:46.22 session with them then we'll flip and we'll start over all over it would be

00:15:51.11 fun to start a spreadsheet or a survey of like when did you turn and like fill

00:15:57.03 out the form of like what made you consciously become did it happen did it

00:16:01.00 happen before we delineated or did you make the decision just to change from

00:16:05.07 regulation listener to comment lever and I would love I would love to know just

00:16:09.18 the percentage of those people that were angered enough by Andrew to make a

00:16:14.21 comment it will always be because of what Andrew said I think

00:16:19.14 it's like 64 percent of all comment leaders became comment leavers because

00:16:23.09 of something Andrew said what about if somebody what if a mime attempted to

00:16:28.08 like if a mime was interacting with you is a mime a comment lever is performance

00:16:33.12 art a comment well if the mime typed a comment what do you mean well no like if

00:16:39.01 you know how a mind performs lasso or whatever like if a mime tried

00:16:42.05 to have a conversation through typical mime if a mind pretended to go up and

00:16:47.05 escalate it towards you yeah like if you tried to communicate

00:16:50.06 that because obviously obviously you can have non-verbal

00:16:53.15 communication but I'm just curious where the mime falls in the category of

00:16:56.21 comment leavers Eric can you read the definition of comment again we'll we'll

00:17:01.22 get to the bottom of this uh I mean but the thing is like I just think he's

00:17:05.14 still caught a verbal or written remark expressing an opinion or reaction so

00:17:10.12 it's not verbal it's not verbal or written so no

00:17:13.05 but Gavin Gavin immediately blew it up and he said like type it and that would

00:17:17.23 be it if he's doing it yeah listen if somebody does performance art about this

00:17:23.20 show they're a [ __ ] comment leaver period

00:17:26.11 they might be a they might be a comment performer but I don't know if they're

00:17:29.23 leaving it okay I will say that they would be a comment performer yeah thank

00:17:34.03 you if someone says something to you in sign language that's not written or

00:17:37.06 verbal but I don't know it still is a cult 100 yeah that's that's a form of

00:17:41.11 communication so I tried to clarify if we got to live by the rules of the

00:17:44.09 dictionary we got to live by the rules of the dictionary that's all I'm saying

00:17:47.11 all right can I ask a completely unrelated question please

00:17:51.17 I was listening to you know that song back that ass up

00:17:55.07 listening I was listening to that recently and I was curious

00:18:00.04 what's the maximum distance you could request for somebody to back the ass up

00:18:05.09 I'd like to see you back the ass up 26.2

00:18:08.13 miles that's the thing like if you're pulling binoculars out I feel like it's

00:18:13.12 rude like what is the courtesy for the back that ass up request I think are you

00:18:17.23 asking how much the arse should be backed up or from house yeah how far

00:18:22.11 does the ass need to be backed up before

00:18:24.12 like you need to take steps forward like I think inappropriate for you to make

00:18:28.04 that request I think it's four feet see I think it might be a dinklage I

00:18:33.07 think a dinklage is the perfect length for a back that ass up request and

00:18:38.04 remind me exactly how much the dinklage is uh in uh I don't know a more

00:18:41.12 traditional it's one yard one yard so three feet so okay I think that's the ma

00:18:45.14 I think anything outside of the dinklage range is inappropriate for you to ask

00:18:49.07 for that ass to be backed up I think that's fair Gavin I was equating it to

00:18:53.00 doors like there's nothing worse than when somebody holds a door open for you

00:18:56.05 and you're too far away and you gotta do that like little run thing like it's

00:18:59.19 definite rules of etiquette within the move yeah as I was curious what you guys

00:19:04.08 thought what what the range was I think I think I think a dinklage is fair yeah

00:19:08.17 okay it's important hey uh uh not not to go back on comment levers uh but I did

00:19:14.10 and I didn't expect to transition into this but this is a great segue I did see

00:19:19.12 one comment on I believe twitter the other day that I thought was so funny

00:19:23.16 and so clever I I and I didn't write it down and I didn't write down their name

00:19:27.11 so I have no idea who to attribute to but to the person that said essentially

00:19:32.01 I'm going to surmise is it possible that Andrew is a time traveler who time

00:19:36.12 traveled back in time to steal the gummies from himself to save some future

00:19:41.00 trauma or tragedy from happening I thought that was brilliant and I would

00:19:44.15 like to know Andrew what do you think the chances are that future you traveled

00:19:48.09 back in time to steal those gummies to avert some sort of tragedy

00:19:52.11 my thought process would I also saw that

00:19:54.15 I thought that's really funny then I had a brief moment of what if and then went

00:19:58.06 back to that's really funny I'd give it a three percent a three percent chance

00:20:02.07 that I time traveled and saved myself from gummies

00:20:05.18 because none of the other stuff was taken

00:20:08.02 only the tampered with stuff was removed from my order I had multiple things in

00:20:12.06 that order that were that's why I think that lends more to the idea that

00:20:16.16 it was you protecting yourself from that's what I'm saying like that that

00:20:20.12 builds the case that it was no future me going back that means the gummies must

00:20:24.16 have been so bad otherwise you would have come back and stolen the ball roll

00:20:28.01 and all that other stuff yeah there's so many things that have happened in my

00:20:31.08 life that would have been better to be avoided so I feel like I don't know why

00:20:35.04 I chose the gummies as the thing that had to be altered dude who knows how bad

00:20:39.13 things could have gone if you didn't know that's the thing you might have

00:20:43.05 gotten an extra large chunk of metal and then somehow it went through your body

00:20:46.19 and you like it like got caught in your urethra and like ripped your dick off or

00:20:50.08 something who knows I can't imagine with all the ankle rolls I've had that that

00:20:53.15 is the moment that I decide to prevent does it seem pretty inconsequential in

00:20:57.19 the grand scheme well one would see one would assume that time travel to right

00:21:02.15 wrongs or to fix a path is probably used exceedingly sparingly because of

00:21:07.11 butterfly effects so I think it would just lend credence to the idea that

00:21:12.13 these gummies were uh if this were to have happened catastrophic to your future

00:21:17.08 yeah I think that's a hard point to argue against and I think it's

00:21:20.16 interesting if that's possible and if we're if we're uh allowing for the idea

00:21:25.01 that Andrew has the ability to time travel Gavin I think it stands to reason

00:21:29.07 that you and I both certainly also have it and probably uh

00:21:32.23 probably have used it even more often than than Andrew so I think maybe we

00:21:37.02 should all just like keep our eyes open uh for the next couple of just every

00:21:40.16 once in a while what's going on around you look look for you hiding behind a

00:21:44.13 tree or something and uh if anything shows up missing or

00:21:49.03 seems weird take a second write it down and uh so we can digest it and see if

00:21:52.13 maybe maybe future face is [ __ ] with current face I'm gonna take inventory of

00:21:57.22 the back of all my shirts just so I have a higher chance of recognizing myself

00:22:01.23 I'm running away

00:22:04.19 the problem is future you would know you did that ah [ __ ] [ __ ]

00:22:10.06 It's gotta be really hard to catch future us

00:22:13.05 I love the idea of future you being like I gotta wear a shirt I don't currently

00:22:18.05 own for this to work if I do that that's the only obstacle do you think there's

00:22:23.09 the possibility Andrew that in the dark uh future you snuck into your bathroom

00:22:27.13 and pulled the shampoo out of your ass and put it back on the shelf.

00:22:33.20 I so hope so I hope you get like it's like a three wish

00:22:39.20 and my first one was to remove the metal gummies

00:22:43.07 my second was to gently push the shampoo bottle out of the ass to put on the

00:22:48.21 counter you're about to be in a situation in a

00:22:52.16 hospital where you're like I found it I swear [Laughter]

00:22:58.12 what if that's Geoff's ghost the gentle ghost what if it's just Geoff it's future

00:23:03.14 Geoff [Music]

00:23:10.10 it feels like a very Geoff move that he would use time his three opportunities

00:23:15.15 of time travel to just [ __ ] with himself dude

00:23:18.18 there's a gentle ghost the law of this is so plausible

00:23:23.01 I would absolutely push myself over gently oh

00:23:28.06 I feel like the law of this podcast is already so complex and now we're adding

00:23:32.22 a time travel element to it it's messy it just makes sense to me I

00:23:37.07 will say you know we're talking about earlier about how future us would know

00:23:41.07 everything past us was going to do so would know how to safeguard it I will

00:23:45.18 say the one thing I think that current us has going for us is confusing to say

00:23:51.16 the the current us as going for we I guess uh is that uh

00:23:56.15 is that future us is probably as lazy as current we

00:24:00.05 and so the future s isn't going to put that much work into it right

00:24:03.13 they're gonna half-ass most of it so there's a pretty good chance we could

00:24:07.12 catch us down the road just knowing that our ethic yeah yeah I think I screwed

00:24:13.06 both versions of us.

00:24:20.00 I just don't understand why future you let you go down the stairs with the fire

00:24:25.23 department like yeah that's I'm questioning future me's choices

00:24:30.19 future you didn't like hit the snooze on the alarm the day you decided to go an

00:24:37.10 hour early to my hubby's bagels

00:24:41.07 oh god I'll stop you from uh leaving that place without taking a [ __ ] first

00:24:53.12 oh man time travel's wild yeah what a great invention um as far

00:25:00.17 as far as like comments and stuff making us laugh I did somebody

00:25:05.14 sent me a really funny screens hot of they they got banned

00:25:10.06 from I believe nhl 22 I'm guessing because they named their creative team

00:25:15.18 the Vancouver child kickers and they got like a whole

00:25:19.18 full like written email about it about how

00:25:22.19 it goes against their term of service and that this was considered a serious

00:25:28.15 violation and that they are banned from playing for a full week

00:25:32.18 their account has been flagged and essentially it's like the next ban

00:25:37.20 you're done and we're gonna be watching you very closely was was the email

00:25:42.15 so I triggered it the child the word child or the fact that it

00:25:47.03 was paid kicker yeah I think that the pairing of the yeah the Vancouver child

00:25:51.22 kicker I'll see if I can find the email that they tweeted at me so I've been

00:25:55.11 trying to reach out to ea to see if we can we can serve this they did the

00:25:58.16 appeal process and they were denied an appeal so it's in a bad spot with the

00:26:03.12 case but uh I thought that was very funny I felt

00:26:06.14 terrible for this person as somebody who has been banned wrongfully at Xbox live

00:26:11.19 I related to their pain yeah I got banned because I named my

00:26:15.23 grif ball team team scrotum and uh I wasn't able to participate in one of the

00:26:20.07 tournaments

00:26:22.17 did you uh along those same lines did you see that comment lever I think it

00:26:28.05 might have been on Instagram who posted that they uh they got kicked out of the

00:26:33.09 spongebob store at I guess universal studios maybe because they had an anal

00:26:38.09 passage shirt on oh no that got me one that got me

00:26:41.06 thinking because I have one of those anal passage shirts what is the most

00:26:46.04 embarrassing place I could wear an anal passage shirt to like we

00:26:49.16 like could I wear it to my next like could I wear it to my colonoscopy

00:26:53.09 or would that be too on the nose I think that's on the notes I don't I think

00:26:56.15 that's like could I wear it to a funeral probably if like uh biden gave you that

00:27:00.23 medal of freedom or whatever except the medal of freedom in an anal

00:27:05.12 passage shirt that would be good drop the uh the email and the thing

00:27:10.06 just read it quickly while reviewing your account we identified the following

00:27:15.16 violation nhl 22 inappropriate content references the children name Vancouver

00:27:20.17 child kicker so I think any mention of child you'd

00:27:23.18 get banned uh I guess yeah by definition of reference to children but that

00:27:29.01 doesn't seem I don't know I feel like they're excited what if

00:27:33.07 what if you what if they submitted the name do not kick children [Laughter]

00:27:38.19 because that's like you couldn't get any more hard-nosed against the idea that

00:27:44.13 would really I think put ea in a tough spot yeah they're not going to be

00:27:49.22 anti that they can't support child kicking it's like an actual thing yeah

00:27:54.00 that's another cooper adult kicker.

00:27:58.10 [Laughter]

00:28:01.07 Oh my god hey what did you guys want to talk about today we had homework from

00:28:06.03 the last show oh yeah we had homework we

00:28:08.12 had oh two things so we had three things we had homework we should probably talk

00:28:12.12 about the bread ties we forgot to talk about

00:28:15.16 okay uh because that's a thing and then uh should we should talk about

00:28:20.04 do now I think we should hold off I don't we that should be

00:28:23.05 okay because that leads me to a whole that whole side idea you and I had

00:28:27.05 Andrew I yeah I think we got to hold off on the

00:28:29.23 we might get sniped on that if we leave that we gotta hold off on that all right

00:28:33.16 well we're not gonna talk about the thing that was bleeped [Laughter]

00:32:20.17 so do you want to do the homework yeah what's your homework what did what was

00:32:24.17 your homework Andrew do it my homework well the homework you assigned for all

00:32:28.14 of us was that we had to come up with what we were the best in the world at

00:32:32.12 and what we thought the other members of this podcast might be the best in the

00:32:36.04 world at that was the home oh okay yeah Gavin did you do your homework sort of

00:32:41.09 sort of okay I really understand the homework what do you mean

00:32:45.14 well because if either one of us were best at anything we wouldn't be doing

00:32:49.09 this that's not true that's that's uh that's a fear we've

00:32:53.12 gone over before there's there is some things that you could be best at that

00:32:58.21 there is no glory for we read yours a podcast homework

00:33:02.01 reminder that we said we would think about what we are best in the world at

00:33:06.23 and what we think others would be best at but you meant other people on this

00:33:10.13 podcast I did oh okay if you wanted to go broader I think

00:33:15.03 that's fine I mean it's Geoff's thing all right uh

00:33:17.11 uh yeah I mean I I don't I don't even remember assigning the homework so I

00:33:20.09 don't really give a [ __ ] one way or the other but this is Andrew home wood

00:33:24.01 no this is Geoff homework it feels like Andrew homework I remember asking if you

00:33:27.16 guys had any idea what you thought the bet you were the best in the world at

00:33:30.23 for sure I definitely the end of the last episode we recorded you're like

00:33:35.02 homework for all of us this is what we'll do and we'll talk about it on the

00:33:38.10 next thing and yeah the way you just said that it sounds

00:33:41.18 like something you would say well it feels like maybe you said you

00:33:44.23 sounded like me apparently maybe that's what I'm the best in the

00:33:49.12 world at oh [ __ ]

00:33:51.11 no there's no way Geoff replied in a funny way he said uh I

00:33:54.23 guess you're the best at remembering homework

00:33:57.08 which I thought was a snipe at me when I'm just trying to get your [ __ ] bit

00:34:01.05 done so this is your idea I don't know why you're coming at me I'm

00:34:05.12 just trying to do a thing for you Gavin can we agree you and I that

00:34:09.13 whether like without relitigating the past that this feels

00:34:12.23 way more like an Andrew thing than a me thing I would agree

00:34:16.11 I don't care how it feels it is a youth thing I think it's the feel of it you're

00:34:21.04 so passionate about it I think it's I think you like you your passion is kind

00:34:25.15 of uh taking ownership over it no I I don't I we don't have to do it at all

00:34:29.05 I'm just trying to do your I'm trying to make sure your thing gets done what do

00:34:32.20 you say this is a betrayal by Geoff I would say this is a definite betrayal by

00:34:37.01 Geoff a hundred percent I'm trying to be team Geofferson pretty

00:34:40.21 quickly after Eric betrayed you about what did when did Eric betray me what

00:34:43.22 was that over the jeopardy rules oh that was I

00:34:47.03 was in the wrong in that one yeah that was a completely justified betrayal this

00:34:51.00 one does not feel like that calling it a betrayal is even wrong we

00:34:55.20 talked about that nobody who had specifically worded it but

00:34:59.11 it was never clarified I never people have said that I've changed the rules

00:35:03.08 it's not that I changed them I just never vocalized them and I realized that

00:35:07.14 that's where it went wrong right that's the constant rule in my

00:35:10.11 head these podcasts just aren't the same without Greg from accounting

00:35:16.23 sorry from finance [ __ ]

00:35:20.04 very different from accounting was clearly never on the podcast Andrew what

00:35:25.11 what would you say you're the best in the world at well I have three things

00:35:30.12 that I wrote down because I took your your homework assignment seriously well

00:35:34.21 today whoever gave the homework is debatable but you do no it's not

00:35:38.04 absolutely you uh number one I don't think I am the best in the world of this

00:35:42.20 anymore but when I was thinking about it I do truly believe that at one point in

00:35:48.12 time I was the best at the sewing machine in the world

00:35:52.03 like hands down not never clo so far from being a great athlete was never

00:35:56.21 incredible in that regard but specifically the sewing machine I think

00:36:01.20 I was amazing at it I think that's the best in the world

00:36:04.09 in my prime in my selling machine day prime number one number two on my list

00:36:09.07 and I'm 80 percent sure I wrote I wrote a little like percentage of how

00:36:12.17 confident I am in this I think I might be the best in the world

00:36:16.12 at waking up when needed without an alarm I'm highly skilled at this you

00:36:20.12 slept in a bathtub for five hours yeah but I didn't have anything to do

00:36:24.15 the next day like I didn't if I'm scheduled for something or I need

00:36:29.03 to be up at a certain time I will hit it within five minutes without an alarm

00:36:34.21 you've got a good internal alarm my internal clock is incredible why don't

00:36:39.08 you use it then because there have been several times where you've been you've

00:36:44.13 had to get up early and to to avoid oversleeping you stay up all night well

00:36:49.14 you can lie down in the bath that's you know that's a that's a great point that

00:36:54.17 is your tactics because I set an alarm because I don't

00:36:58.03 fully trust it but I I am consistent at it I've never missed anything because I

00:37:02.06 slept through it I always get up early regardless of the time you may have

00:37:06.07 poked a giant hole in that I may have to remove that from the list that's why it

00:37:09.14 was 80

00:37:10.18 okay but generally speaking I feel pretty good at that but I think you're

00:37:14.04 right there are times in the show where I've said I've had to do things to to

00:37:17.20 make sure as I was there on time it's just the paranoid thing for the show

00:37:20.23 specifically 80 so that's my 80100

00:37:23.16 I think there's no denying this I feel very strongly about this I think 100

00:37:29.03 I am the best Xbox Garfield cart furious racing player in

00:37:34.17 the world who has had part of their bowel surgically removed I feel strongly

00:37:39.18 on that uh I don't think there's any debate about that when did you lose some

00:37:45.07 bowel I was like five oh okay a long time ago had to have operations

00:37:49.21 the whole thing but I don't think there's anyone better at Garfield cart

00:37:54.22 furious racing on the Xbox who has also had part of their bowel removed and it's

00:37:59.07 any part so like even if someone had a different part of the bowel any part I

00:38:02.23 mean it's a lot you got a lot to work with on the battle that's a lot of air

00:38:06.11 any opposition in that one you got to [ __ ] hole the poke in that Gavin I

00:38:09.17 think you might be telling me that I think you might be right

00:38:12.13 I think that might be uh I think that's my my current we'll have to treat it

00:38:16.06 with the same level of detective work as my overkill clip we'll have to start

00:38:19.17 interviewing other people on the leader board see if all their bowel is

00:38:22.22 there but I think you could be right that's fair yeah I don't know it's

00:38:26.12 definitely it's definitely something that's research able so those are mine

00:38:30.11 I'd love to hear what your your two what you guys think you're the you're the

00:38:34.21 best at Gavin do you want to go you want me to go um my one I think I'm the best

00:38:41.03 at um when something goes wrong and I get filled with anxiety I immediately

00:38:45.12 skip to the to the worst case scenario and bottle it all up and deal with it at

00:38:51.20 3am I'm the best at doing that I can carry on doing something after

00:38:55.14 receiving you know bad news or like everything's gone wrong just swallow it

00:38:59.17 up worry about it at three but I can still continue functioning that day I'm

00:39:03.14 pretty good at it so 3am is the worst time to ever try to reach you 3am is the

00:39:08.19 worst time just for anything ever like if you're awake at 3am it's a disaster

00:39:13.06 something's going wrong that's true it's not either it's not it's not like late

00:39:18.19 night or early morning it's just a horrendous hour the only reason to be

00:39:23.20 joyfully awake at three in the morning is uh is if you're into astrology or

00:39:29.09 astronomy in some way and you're like wanting to see a comet go by or a blood

00:39:34.12 moon or something literally sure I feel like I had a lot of like 3 am 4

00:39:38.07 am halo 2 nights outside of that I can't think of any positive times in which I

00:39:43.01 was up at that hour if I'm playing video games at 3am I'm I'm

00:39:48.00 yelling at myself while playing video games at 3am that I stayed up an hour

00:39:52.12 too late and I'm gonna regret it yeah you think two is the cutoff yeah for me

00:39:56.19 at this point yeah cause two is still like the previous night no to just be

00:40:00.16 fair I'm saying when I'm like 13 when I'm 123am I haven't I can't remember

00:40:06.00 the last time I was up until 3am playing video game it's been a while I guess

00:40:10.00 donkey Kong maybe before we did that bet that'd be the last time

00:40:14.14 okay so you're you're saying you're the best in the world at

00:40:19.13 anxiety until three okay okay that's good yeah I can't argue that that

00:40:24.17 feels that possible I it it feels likely honestly it does

00:40:28.01 like it makes a lot of sense to me well when you describe it like that uh I

00:40:31.11 actually completely buy in I buy into that in a way that I'm not sure I do

00:40:34.19 with some of andrew's stuff but yeah absolutely what about you Geoff uh well

00:40:38.17 similar to Andrew I don't know if I currently am still but there was a point

00:40:42.21 in time uh when I would stake my life that I was the best head bobber on earth

00:40:48.10 uh when I was making red versus blue I don't think there's anybody that could

00:40:53.14 come even close to bobbing heads like I did I've been a witness to it that you

00:40:56.17 could he could do it without even listening you could just do it based on

00:41:01.01 looking at the waveform it's insane I I think that uh once again not

00:41:05.01 entirely certain that I still am but I would feel pretty good about it I think

00:41:09.21 that I there was a point in time when I was the best peggo player on earth

00:41:15.01 uh and I would I would I feel very confident about that

00:41:18.01 and uh the third thing is I think I'm re I think I'm the best in the world at

00:41:23.18 compartmentalizing dog tragedy [Music]

00:41:29.07 I know I know it's not gonna go in a funny direction but it's a really funny

00:41:33.22 sentence no it's it's it's it is what it is right I've dealt with a lot of dog

00:41:37.20 tragedy over the last year or so it's manifested itself into very funny

00:41:42.00 stories on the podcast but they weren't funny moments and I did a

00:41:45.06 really good job of compartment compartmentalizing uh until I got

00:41:48.17 through them and you know cried in the shower or whatnot or on a park bench the

00:41:54.04 next day I mean your ability to just do face amongst the rest of your life is I

00:41:58.05 think what you're best at well that's it is it does sometimes feel like I'm in

00:42:04.02 this library talking to you guys for an hour and I look out the window and uh

00:42:09.22 the entire world is on fire or at least my entire world is on fire

00:42:14.23 just like it's just like just like [ __ ]

00:42:16.17 and flames everywhere

00:42:20.02 but not always so just to clarify your head bob cause I

00:42:24.12 misinterpreted what you meant originally you mean machinima like when you're

00:42:27.16 filming to make it seem like the character is talking the movement of

00:42:31.06 their head yeah machinimation literal head like I was imagining like a wayne's

00:42:36.17 world like head bob like you're really like listening to music

00:42:40.19 no I wouldn't even put myself like in the top

00:42:43.17 75 percentile of that I got no skills in in irl head bobbing no okay

00:42:48.08 I have a question how does percentile differ from percent they're spelled

00:42:54.02 differently uh he's he's right good point move on I don't percentile each of

00:43:02.15 the hundred equal what the [ __ ]

00:43:06.00 what the [ __ ] is they just seem like they can always be interchangeable I'm

00:43:10.01 not ever in a situation where it's like oh he should have said percentile

00:43:14.17 instead of percent I definition hold on I [ __ ] now I gotta know like it's

00:43:19.22 always talked about with kids all right nick go ahead and cut out all

00:43:24.05 this dead air.

00:43:27.05 I'm sorry I don't know I'm reading what you wrote Eric

00:43:31.10 you wrote a thing yeah I wrote it for Geoff this is the thing where I cue him

00:43:36.08 up and then he reads it and then he continues the

00:43:41.01 the percentage is a means of comparing quantities a percentile is used to

00:43:45.22 display exactly what Eric wrote yeah I'm reading what Eric wrote you

00:43:50.17 just said read whatever I thought you were in that of Google oh

00:43:55.20 god I'm sorry about that merrick I think harry potter I think Aaron cost that

00:44:00.21 what how would how how was that me that's me giving the answer and then one

00:44:05.22 of you takes the ball gives the answer to the audience here we go continue

00:44:11.11 freaking read the ball first that's you know what I feel responsible

00:44:15.14 more than Eric does I I typically he's right one of us will read what he wrote

00:44:19.12 and then that will carry on what were you doing Gavin why were you not paying

00:44:24.12 attention it was just quiet and then Gavin went who's gonna read that like

00:44:29.09 what were you doing did I say who's gonna read that

00:44:33.18 you asked you asked he was going to read what Eric wrote did you not see that

00:44:39.03 that's how we got here yes

00:44:42.23 why didn't you read it I said I was I was just trying to come up with the

00:44:47.22 answer in my own head I was just reading it spaced you

00:44:51.22 that's great that's very helpful anyway this is a hard podcast to explain

00:44:57.16 to people uh who have uh never heard of face but who might be familiar with red

00:45:01.15 versus blue I meant to I meant to come back around to that about 40 minutes ago

00:45:05.03 I just realized I never finished my point uh anyway it's it's just a hard

00:45:08.22 it's hard to quantify or hard to explain succinctly what this podcast is and uh

00:45:13.22 uh uh I encourage you to try someday I can um I have a new electrical problem

00:45:20.13 what's your electric problem I mean I assume it's one I've had the entire time

00:45:26.12 but I've narrowed it down sometimes my toilet I got one of those little bidets

00:45:30.19 it will warm the seat and it will blast it was blast the war up the crev I know

00:45:35.14 that everyone's a fan of those on this podcast um they had to run a new

00:45:40.04 outlet to the toilet to put it in so they just

00:45:43.20 I guess daisy chained off the nearest one and sometimes it trips the breaker

00:45:48.19 and I couldn't figure out why and it turns out if I'm sat on the toilet and

00:45:54.23 someone rings my doorbell the breaker trips and the toilet turns off which

00:46:00.02 you know for normal toilets not a problem if you've got no power but I

00:46:03.17 can't flush it without power there's like a manual release I

00:46:07.18 guess where you have to like take off one of the side panels if you want to

00:46:11.14 actually manually flush it but it uses power to flush so now that I know this

00:46:15.19 I'm so paranoid that when I'm taking taking a lovely number two I'm so

00:46:20.00 paranoid I'm gonna get delivery or someone's gonna ring the doorbell

00:46:24.17 because then I'll have to leave a bunch of turd in the toilet

00:46:28.04 while I waddle over to the breaker and get it back up

00:46:32.12 and it's just a bizarre problem to have I don't know why

00:46:35.04 two areas of the house are on the same two different areas are on the same

00:46:39.03 breaker it's literally like attic light toilet and doorbell are all in one

00:46:44.23 breaker so is there so I think what's happening is is the

00:46:48.17 toilet is drawing like basically right at the limit of

00:46:53.01 whatever that breaker allows and uh just ringing the doorbell tips over the edge

00:46:58.21 that is so [ __ ] funny and makes me and makes

00:47:02.10 me so excited to ding dong ditch you yeah hours of the day and night for the

00:47:07.16 rest of your life it's been hard navigating like

00:47:11.18 leaving a toilet full of poo and hoping that meg doesn't find it while I sprint

00:47:16.23 to the research how many times has it happened uh it's

00:47:22.04 happened oh probably only three times that's quite a few but it but now that

00:47:28.11 I've identified it it's it's terrifying I used to take the sort of

00:47:32.18 stress-free shits and now every strip every [ __ ] is a stress huh

00:47:37.06 so we need to we need to look into Geoff if we can somehow ring his doorbell

00:47:41.13 remotely dude I was way ahead of you we need to we absolutely need to figure

00:47:47.05 that out if we can trigger a doorbell ring remotely any time gav

00:47:50.19 I'll just text with you constantly I'll just play what are you doing right now

00:47:53.07 what are you doing right now are you gonna go play halo do you get you can do

00:47:56.21 anything you're gonna take a dump okay cool

00:47:58.22 uh I hesitate to bring this up because I I it's not as funny as your story but

00:48:03.22 the exact well minus the doorbell part the same thing

00:48:08.17 happens with my uh bidet toilet as well about once a week it's the same thing

00:48:13.20 they had to put a plug in into the wall so it's daisy chained onto my laundry

00:48:18.12 room and about once a week uh one of the plugs there will trip like a little

00:48:23.05 breaker in the plug you know yeah and uh and then I lose access to my toilet and

00:48:27.09 my whole bathroom actually uh and then so I have to I have to just go out and

00:48:31.12 push that button back in and then it works uh so not very funny but one funny

00:48:35.12 thing kind of funny thing did happen the first time this occurred

00:48:39.15 we didn't know what to do we couldn't figure it out I think I had to go out of

00:48:43.10 town briefly so Emily called an electrician to come and take a look at

00:48:47.04 it and he couldn't figure it out and he couldn't figure it out and he couldn't

00:48:50.09 figure it out and he eventually he eventually ripped the walls out of

00:48:54.21 the bathroom to follow the wiring to figure it out

00:48:58.21 and he still couldn't figure it out and then joey

00:49:01.09 who you know from gogo now yeah is also like a carpenter he came over and he was

00:49:05.22 like trying to help Emily and this guy and he looked and he goes oh your

00:49:09.05 breaker's tripped and he just hit the button and everything worked again and

00:49:12.12 had to have all my walls re-drywalled.

00:49:14.23 I didn't pay for it the guy did it at cost but uh yeah the guy did a

00:49:19.20 a five-second fix turned into three days of painting and drywall

00:49:26.06 three [ __ ] days that's that is such a classic u-house problem

00:49:31.09 I can't believe that with all the people involved nobody thought check the

00:49:36.02 breaker just no it's not not even one zero it's so weird right because it's

00:49:39.03 not just like the breaker in the wall it's literally the breaker on a plug

00:49:43.05 right the gfci yeah like the gsci thing yeah and so I he just like joey figured

00:49:47.22 it out but you know uh because he's a common sense dude but yeah that guy uh

00:49:52.19 that guy ended up on what should have taken him one second

00:49:55.15 he spent three days at my house all day long so the story is just you got to

00:50:00.01 keep you got to keep [ __ ] simple like the more expensive and fancy something

00:50:04.03 is the more stupid problems you know with like Geoff's fridge it's just it's a

00:50:08.05 custom size much more expensive and I got a freaking toilet that I can't flush

00:50:13.22 with my hand side of the thing apart it's ridiculous

00:50:18.08 that might be the funniest thing on earth dude if somebody rings your doorbell

00:50:23.10 if somebody rings your [ __ ] doorbell you you can't remove turds

00:50:27.22 yeah that's such a strange [ __ ] in my doorbell off I know somebody who every

00:50:32.12 time they would get a phone call their internet would drop briefly on like

00:50:36.05 their land line and so there'd be times we'd be playing games and it'd be fun to

00:50:40.15 just call them if they they were like winning or something they had the lead

00:50:44.08 but a [ __ ] bile connection is great Geoff

00:50:47.05 what if we you know those drinking birds like these things can we like attach

00:50:53.09 that to his door and just have it ringing constantly

00:50:56.09 but we have to we have to try to get creative with ways in which we can ring

00:50:59.15 it multiple times without actually having to put the effort in of

00:51:04.04 physically pushing it I love it dude that makes so much sense to me

00:51:07.11 speaking speaking of birth I had somebody sent me your swan is kind of

00:51:11.16 famous Geoff I don't know if you know this is it really no I wasn't aware

00:51:15.18 there is a documented history of your swan attacking people there is an

00:51:20.23 Instagram video last year of a guy who was like wake

00:51:24.08 boarding on in that lake and he got attacked by the swan I have a photo of

00:51:30.02 the swan mid attack oh my god on this guy look at him he's oh I swear to

00:51:39.09 tell me about it tell me about it it's like a it's like it's like an eagle is

00:51:44.05 that what your face looked like when it was happening to you I don't think I I

00:51:48.04 think I looked I don't think I looked that cool I think it looked even worse.

00:51:53.11 [Laughter]

00:51:55.01 Yeah dude so that is that is swan confirmation that is the same he's about

00:51:59.14 to get his back bit yeah that's rough yeah he uh the swan bites the guy's

00:52:03.00 ankle and he he eats hard he he crashes immediately on impact and swan the swan

00:52:08.13 takes him out it's a great Instagram video uh but they

00:52:12.09 said that it flew like 150 yards like it was huge the distance it covered yeah.

00:52:19.00 [Laughter]

00:52:22.06 It's highly aggressive

00:52:29.07 for the record by the way if you are anywhere near Austin Texas stay away

00:52:34.09 from that swan it's very dangerous and very aggressive I want nothing to do

00:52:39.20 with that [ __ ] thing by the way this photo is such validation

00:52:43.18 to me it is just as terrifying in picture form as I remember being

00:52:47.14 it's very intimidating and he actually went down the swan took him out and he

00:52:51.03 was in the water with the swan it's amazing he survived what hat did the

00:52:54.16 swan keep at him no I guess like it bit him and then it kind of like held its

00:52:58.03 ground for a minute then it [ __ I off I don't think it really stuck around

00:53:03.07 I was just looking for the next person it is yeah exactly

00:53:07.11 get out of my territory that flies away [Laughter]

00:53:11.16 oh that's awesome uh so would we do we then do the list of what we think other

00:53:16.17 people are the best at oh it's a great idea again

00:53:19.19 and wrap this up for Geoff's Geoff I'll go with mine I don't think Geoff's the face

00:53:24.02 bed I don't know who's who I think Geoff is the best at long-term deception like

00:53:28.22 planning a lie and then you know not revealing it for years like the driving

00:53:33.11 test or driving or you know some of the some of the ones

00:53:37.03 that have some of the ones that are a good 12 years old that are still going

00:53:40.01 yeah yeah some of the ones that I don't even know about yet and I would say

00:53:44.10 Andrew is the best at pulling comedy from a small bathroom

00:53:47.12 without even necessarily involving the toilet which is uh I think very

00:53:51.07 impressive I think you're the best of that

00:53:54.12 that's that's very specific that might be true what about you Geoff uh

00:54:00.04 I think Gavin is the well I may be partial but I think he's I mean

00:54:04.10 I think he goes out saying he's the best high-speed photographer in the world

00:54:10.08 um but I think he's I think he's the best at taking something that's really

00:54:14.21 like I think he's the best at distilling something down uh that's very

00:54:18.06 complicated into a way that I can understand it he's really really really

00:54:21.17 good at that he's also the he's also the best at being a best friend I've ever

00:54:26.13 had um and uh oh yours was really nice yeah you

00:54:29.16 know I'm a big ass wimp in my old age uh Andrew uh I think you are the best at

00:54:35.12 saying something that completely catches

00:54:38.12 me off guard like you're the best person that coming out of left field I've ever

00:54:43.18 met in my entire life like it's not even close I like left field I've been there

00:54:48.00 a while left field is always great is that baseball tim

00:54:52.19 because I realized I used that phrase but I have no

00:54:56.02 knowledge of baseball like that's that's leaked across international wars to you

00:54:59.23 know countries that don't have baseball I feel like I've said that before

00:55:04.06 I don't necessarily even understand the reference is the handedness of the

00:55:08.21 batter what dictates that what is the word you

00:55:11.19 can't come out of left field for Geoff it would have to be right field yeah I

00:55:14.17 guess I'd be coming out of right field for Geoff in my head I'm assuming it's

00:55:18.13 based on the orientation of most batters oh everyone handed it everyone be quiet

00:55:22.12 quiet Eric's read some I'll read it okay Eric's Eric says that at 351 p.m Eric

00:55:28.00 today Eric said yes the phrase came from baseball

00:55:32.02 terminology referring to a play in which

00:55:34.13 the ball is thrown from the area covered

00:55:38.00 by the left fielder to either home plate

00:55:39.19 or first base surprising the runner that was no explanation to Gavin I guarantee

00:55:44.15 you and and would that be flipped for a left-handed batter but no it's the same

00:55:49.21 the basement in the same place so it wouldn't be the base yeah I guess yeah

00:55:53.06 the batting orientation is irrelevant but also baseball is a very right-handed

00:55:58.06 sport and very centered around and all the rules are all basically built about

00:56:02.19 being right-handed lefties are kind of uh there are left-handers in baseball

00:56:06.14 but I I I feel like it's uh it would be funny against lefties a

00:56:10.16 lefty stepped up to the plate and bases one and three swapped

00:56:18.19 and you can do like a score multiplier with the amount of people you pass on

00:56:23.07 your own team like if there's a guy in first and second already and you have to

00:56:26.23 go left [Laughter]

00:56:28.21 you guys are straight in baseball just like the savannah bananas that's about

00:56:33.03 to say do you know the banana I had recently learned banana ball their rules

00:56:37.06 their rule set is fantastic I try better than normal I tried to get tickets to a

00:56:40.19 game but they're sold out for the rest of the year

00:56:43.06 you know what the savannah bananas are Gavin is that what Geoff posted about the

00:56:47.07 uh like there's a like a baby banana every time and there's like people on

00:56:50.19 stilts yeah yeah they do like entertainment

00:56:53.16 style baseball instead of strict rules and they have their own rule set some of

00:56:58.16 I think my favorite rules from banana ball are is if a player hits a foul ball

00:57:03.07 into the stands and somebody catches it it's an out like the fans can eliminate

00:57:07.21 players by catching it it is the best [ __ ] rule ever it's a great rule the

00:57:13.07 other I think favorite rule of theirs is

00:57:16.00 if you let somebody walk so if you throw

00:57:18.12 four foul balls on a guy he doesn't just

00:57:21.05 get one base he gets as many bases as he can possibly run to before the other

00:57:24.15 team passes the ball that every position skilled player on the team so they just

00:57:28.11 have to rapidly throw the ball around while one guy is sprinting as fast as he

00:57:31.20 can it's great it's a great rule set that's the thing and

00:57:36.00 and the game is over at two hours come hell or hell water yes they put a title

00:57:41.10 yeah I think their average games are 90

00:57:43.11 minutes so it's it's great I've never seen one I think the I think the way

00:57:48.23 scoring works too is like you get a point per inning that you win

00:57:52.11 so like if you score 10 runs and then any other team scores two you just get

00:57:55.07 you just win that inning and you get one point which I think is kind of

00:57:58.17 interesting too can we have fun I don't think they need us I don't I don't know

00:58:03.05 I don't know how that I think it's a league be interesting to

00:58:06.03 look at the league that they're in I think it's a college we could probably

00:58:09.06 sponsor a singular funny object they'd probably let us do that

00:58:13.12 like we've got a dude's elbow for a game or something

00:58:19.01 oh can we sponsor the uh the the thing on the side of the helmet that protects

00:58:23.22 the ear on the side of the helmet that protects the ear like the ear donut yeah

00:58:29.16 yeah we'll spot some one guy's ear donut for a season

00:58:34.00 surely they'll let us do that what do you want to put on the ear donut

00:58:38.03 face yeah just the name of the show okay I just wasn't yeah sure we could have a

00:58:42.17 variety of choices uh standard ear across the ear

00:58:46.10 I think we could do we could become the official bread tag sponsor of the

00:58:51.13 savannah bananas and we can donate bread tags for all of their bread uh tagging

00:58:56.13 needs have you had a bread tag yet have you

00:58:58.20 received it yeah that's why I brought it up have you got any good have you got

00:59:03.01 yours yet no Andrew have you got yours yet I do yeah

00:59:06.12 I haven't tried have you tried breading yeah so here's the deal uh

00:59:11.01 first off it's beautiful I mean it's absolutely [ __ ] beautiful

00:59:15.11 let me guess there's a reason they're made out of plastic and the the deal with

00:59:20.23 the deal with uh to refresh the audience's memory that we were trying to

00:59:25.13 solve a problem and uh I would say ostensibly we did uh the problem being

00:59:29.22 you know what it's like when you get like a a loaf of uh wonder bread or

00:59:34.09 wheat bread or whatever it is you eat 12

00:59:36.10 grain whatever and uh it's got that it has a bread tie nobody likes a bread tie

00:59:40.03 bread ties are lame right uh or sometimes it'll have that bread tag and

00:59:43.22 the brag tag is cool because it'll say like uh hey the best by June 3rd or

00:59:48.10 whatever uh and uh it's kind of a clever

00:59:51.04 little design but invariably after three or four times you use it as the plastic

00:59:55.18 bins one of the ends snaps off and then the bread ties [ __ ] useless and then

00:59:59.15 you got to do the thing where you roll the bread and then you like shove the

01:00:03.03 thing under the bread and sit on it and then it's like it's just it's [ __ ]

01:00:08.00 dumb right so uh uniform via face decided we were going to solve that

01:00:12.21 problem by creating a metal bread tag that does not bend and break

01:00:17.21 and I am proud I am honored to say that face

01:00:21.05 it's either in the store now and been in the store for a while or it's about to

01:00:26.12 be in the store we have solved the problem of bread tags breaking these

01:00:31.22 metal bread tags these metal these light blue sky blue face emblazoned with the

01:00:37.06 date June 19th 2022 on them bread tags will never bend or break however

01:00:45.22 it turns out that the bending part pretty integral pretty integral to

01:00:52.08 bread tag functionality uh it's I'm gonna go ahead and say impossible to use

01:01:00.15 to get to get the the wrapper uh the plastic in the bread tag holder

01:01:08.00 it's just not gonna happen because this [ __ ] will not break it will not bend

01:01:13.09 it's sturdy just unfortunately yeah no the gap is regulation gap it's

01:01:19.05 just that without the bend you just can't get so it's it doesn't work as a

01:01:25.02 bread tag as as in the traditional sense but

01:01:29.05 it definitely looks like one it's very pretty

01:01:32.12 and even better it's got a magnet on the back of it so it's really it quite

01:01:37.20 possibly the world's first bread tag kitchen magnet that's permanent I I will

01:01:43.09 say it's a rare problem for us I feel like these are too high quality is the

01:01:48.12 problem yeah yeah they're just real good it's really sturdy you can't bend it

01:01:53.11 so it's too luxury and therefore too inconvenient yeah

01:01:56.18 yeah this is a this is a show tag this is the kind of tag you bring out to brag

01:02:01.00 to your friends at Christmas dinner you know like when you pull the good plates

01:02:05.16 out once a year the china or whatever you know when you polish up the the the

01:02:10.00 old 1955 uh like Porsche to drive around on the s on Sunday uh it's the thing

01:02:15.04 that you revere when like all your friends maybe your co-workers maybe

01:02:18.01 you're gonna have your boss over for dinner and you want to impress him this

01:02:21.05 is the bread tag you pull out just don't try to use it as a bread tag I can't

01:02:25.03 wait to get mine I can't wait to see videos of people trying to use them

01:02:29.01 it's great I don't I'm curious if I I really want to get a loaf of bread right

01:02:32.13 I'm trying to think if I I think I have one in my fridge I think it would take

01:02:34.13 me probably like five minutes I think you could do it but the time it would

01:02:39.07 require to slip it through why don't you try live on the podcast

01:02:43.16 I'll go get something that's a good point once you do that we'll end with

01:02:48.23 Andrew trying to force a metal bread clip I'll say I'll say while he's gone

01:02:55.12 uh I I felt uh exactly like he did and I did I give the dog this pill uh I uh

01:03:01.12 I I had I took that five minutes to try to make it work I was bound to determine

01:03:05.08 and I gave up so if he's able to do it he's either lying or he's uh he's made

01:03:09.07 of interesting because listening to you describe it I I'm almost 100 sure I

01:03:13.20 could get it in I thought so too I thought so too yeah it's like one of

01:03:16.22 those things where it's like I kind of want the challenge of it now

01:03:20.17 I have confidence yeah I encourage you uh I I challenge you to to make it work

01:03:26.13 I hope you can people stop stealing my packages then uh I'll give it a go did

01:03:30.09 we find them did not did Geoff not find all your packages

01:03:34.01 uh yeah I thought no they found some but Sarah was annoyed that someone took all

01:03:40.01 of my achievement under merch [Laughter]

01:03:43.02 do you think Andrew has transitioned to the uh

01:03:46.07 floor that contains his kitchen already do you think he's hurt his ankle yet a

01:03:50.14 hundred percent I was about to say he's absolutely hurt his ankle his mic is

01:03:54.09 muted which is a great point from nick he's screaming yeah screaming from the

01:03:59.14 other room he's uh he's limping back right now

01:04:02.17 this is gonna be rough okay so I have the bread that was way faster than I was

01:04:07.20 expecting I was about to bring up laser tag and everything but

01:04:11.01 go ahead I'm trying I mean I don't know what you mean by go ahead I'm trying to

01:04:14.14 slip this you definitely can't bend it I mean maybe with pliers but it would

01:04:19.11 I'll say two uh one thing I did find out

01:04:21.12 I was showing it off to Emily and uh she

01:04:22.12 was agreeing that it's beautiful and she was wondering why it was light blue and

01:04:25.20 I was like I don't know I think it's just what color they all are turns out

01:04:28.20 that's not the case the color they're color dependent based on the day they

01:04:32.17 were put out so light blue is Monday what so apparently like if you see a

01:04:36.23 bread tag uh and it's light blue at the store you

01:04:39.16 know that that bread has been out since Monday if it's green it's been out since

01:04:43.22 whatever day that is yeah I didn't know it seems to be struggling I think uh

01:04:48.23 yeah I I've ripped I'm ripping holes into the bread bag itself

01:04:53.16 yeah trying to pinching it pretty sharp metal it is pretty sharp metal um

01:04:58.21 yeah I don't think I don't think this works at in any way I was wrong I think

01:05:04.19 I was dramatically wrong yeah you'll mangle you'll mangle it real

01:05:08.05 fast uh and by it I mean the plastic yeah I'll try and pick up mine to try

01:05:12.19 next week if you if you get it you deserve a medal some kind this is you if

01:05:16.23 you if you do it you're the bread tag champion of face that's for sure I'll

01:05:21.18 just put a chain around the brake clip and that could be metal [Laughter]

01:05:27.05 become a chain guy with a bread clip thing as the ah

01:05:30.19 I would wear that that I would wear that dude wear that yeah let's make him

01:05:36.01 chains don't forget though if you have a pacemaker uh or some sort of a metal

01:05:41.13 implant that is a magnet I don't wanna want you

01:05:44.18 wearing a bread tag around your heart that's gonna cause you to have a heart

01:05:49.03 attack uh okay well I guess that's uh as Andrew
