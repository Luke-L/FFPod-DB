00:00:28.01 [Music]

00:00:35.11 This is hello and welcome to episode 65

00:00:38.06 of the F**kFuckFacePodcast uh my name is Geoff Ramsey and with me as always Andrew

00:00:43.18 patton and Gavin free in no particular order although I realize saying it out

00:00:48.20 loud I usually say Gavin before Andrew and I wonder why I do that it's not

00:00:52.09 intentional but it definitely happens more often than not this is kind of a

00:00:57.01 special Gavin talking about this yesterday it's a special episode we're

00:01:00.21 not supposed to be filming this right now uh this is a sort of a gift from the

00:01:06.13 podcast gods that we are doing this in this moment

00:01:08.18 the last time we all spoke together yeah you're not talking the last time we all

00:01:12.01 sponsored it I'm sorry sorry I didn't mean to interrupt you uh

00:01:15.12 I'm just gonna say the last time we all spoke together we talked about how it

00:01:18.12 might be the last time we ever speak together if anybody died nobody did

00:01:22.23 no that's what I was gonna say I thought you're saying that it's a special

00:01:26.10 episode because we weren't expecting to do it I think it's special that we all

00:01:30.17 lived after you cursed us well I didn't curse us I just just pointed out so far

00:01:35.10 yeah that's true Gavin uh Gavin might be might be we should get into it uh it's

00:01:39.13 gonna be a fun podcast for a couple reasons I think uh we tried to make the

00:01:43.13 most of this extra time together uh which if Gavin lives long enough to tell

00:01:47.13 the story we can get into that uh but Gavin you're dying I might have poisoned

00:01:52.21 myself I'm not sure yet I'm uh I feel a bit dizzy and my throat feels small

00:01:58.12 um I I decided I'd I'd tackle the wasp nest right before this

00:02:03.22 um I don't know if we updated the face listeners but

00:02:08.10 the nest was partially destroyed when I turned on the fan and then they just

00:02:14.02 decided we'll just make it on the outside of the fan so they're now

00:02:17.09 on the bit that doesn't spin where the fan connects to the ceiling a big old

00:02:22.21 nest haven't been out there a while I thought I'll I'll buy some killer

00:02:27.08 sorry I bought a little kind of wasp foam I'm not sure how it kills the wasps

00:02:31.17 I assume it's an extremely powerful poison because I sprayed it I sprayed it

00:02:37.07 on the nest and they just dropped dead within like

00:02:40.21 five seconds and I I was like bloody and I was reading the instructions it was

00:02:44.04 like spray from you know upwind you don't want it blowing on you and then

00:02:48.02 immediately get out of there and I was I stepped back and I just watched all

00:02:51.21 these wasps just dropped down dead I was like bloody yeah what is this stuff

00:02:55.22 what's it doing to him and um I just backed the way the hell up but then

00:03:01.00 I started to feel the wind against my face and I was like oh should I beat you

00:03:04.23 up and I just thought I need to get out I need but I said I need to cross

00:03:08.17 directly under the under the nest to get out of it so I just like pulled my

00:03:12.19 t-shirt up I just powered through and ever since then I've been feeling a

00:03:17.14 little bit dizzy a little bit shaky and my throat feels small

00:03:21.21 so I've just told them I've told my co-host here just to

00:03:26.01 check in on me if I go quiet for too long just make sure I'm still there

00:03:30.15 because I don't know what might happen and I'm sure I'm just feeling a little

00:03:34.09 bit paranoid because I felt wind on my face and must have immediately thought

00:03:38.08 I've inhaled this stuff so it might be my own body playing tricks on me but who

00:03:42.06 knows hopefully I'm hopefully I'm fine I'll be honest with you dude uh it

00:03:46.23 doesn't sound good it doesn't sound good I have two

00:03:49.10 immediate thoughts one I love that in the instructions that you read them you

00:03:53.09 took the time to read them you were safe right the whole can their instructions

00:03:57.13 weren't to like wear protective gear make sure you have a mask on their their

00:04:01.07 instructions were use it and book it because it will be problems if you stay

00:04:04.22 yeah well there's a lot of other stuff it was like don't don't use on a day

00:04:08.16 when it's when it's gonna rain sure that was another one because I don't want it

00:04:12.13 to like wash into the water systems I guess but I just I feel like it's such

00:04:15.16 an obvious you should probably be wearing a mask to do this and it seems

00:04:20.00 as though their tone was just run really fast

00:04:22.06 nick's right it did say use at dusk and I didn't I didn't pay attention to that

00:04:26.19 okay I know take back everything I said you opened this by seeming like you were

00:04:31.10 following all instructions is given and you clearly just skimmed it he read them

00:04:35.20 he didn't heed them it's different stuff is just that there's gonna be less

00:04:38.22 wasps there during the day they're gonna be they're not gonna be all back oh you

00:04:42.06 think that they're not working that's a wasp warning they don't you attack the

00:04:45.15 full crew at once they're going for your safety in case there's no they want you

00:04:49.00 to get the [ __ ] they want you to to use

00:04:51.09 it on them when they're at least active and when most of them are back but I see

00:04:54.12 it I'll just quickly get this done because because basically I want to be

00:04:58.11 uh I need to work in that area I need to do some other drilling and

00:05:02.02 you want to get them at the end of the day after they've done their full eight

00:05:06.02 hour wasp duties and they're exhausted and they're sitting around their wasps

00:05:09.18 dinner tables just trying to eat a little bit of food and listen to their

00:05:13.10 shitty wasp family talk about their name

00:05:15.12 and they're just exhausted and just kind of emotionally drained and then that's

00:05:18.17 when you hit them with the poison I feel like you're setting up a real lone

00:05:21.19 survivor scenario which I'd be very fearful of you're there's gonna be one

00:05:26.04 waft who comes home sees what has happened and we'll be

00:05:29.04 vengeful I was gonna say the other thing that that brings me a lot of joy is the

00:05:32.12 fact that you're living the happening too you're the only person outside of

00:05:36.06 the happening that is run from the wind that is terrified of the breeze that

00:05:40.06 when you felt that breeze it was like this is death I gotta go I I swear that

00:05:44.15 was like an immediate windshield I would have honestly just left them because

00:05:48.03 I mean they don't really they're not very aggressive but I have seen my cat

00:05:52.09 sort of jump at him and try and chase him and I thought that smee's gonna get

00:05:55.19 stung on his face if he probably probably I might as well just shift this

00:06:01.05 one nest when the wind started to attack you did you go what no like

00:06:05.14 like mark wahlberg slowed down to like five percent fifty percent [Music]

00:06:15.12 well I don't I don't want you to be the only one poisoned Gavin I had you

00:06:20.08 reminded me of something you're gonna drink some bleach to me no no so I

00:06:25.07 I was going through my closet and I've been trying to find a certain cable I

00:06:30.22 wanted to reset up my Xbox 360. So I've just been going through everything I

00:06:34.17 have and I found a garbage bag and I was like what what is this I don't remember

00:06:38.17 what this I still have my fire extinguisher in my garbage bag from when

00:06:43.07 I fired it with all the stuff I haven't opened it yet

00:06:45.16 I've been meaning to take it apart why not just throw it all away

00:06:49.12 well because I kind of want to see what it looks like on the inside

00:06:54.04 you should try and like buy a load of vials and you can sell it to who where

00:06:59.11 like what what do you mean not the rusty store

00:07:02.13 vials of fire extinguisher Gavin I'm having a hard time moving these sauces I

00:07:08.03 don't think the fire extinguisher well you got to start getting your I was

00:07:11.12 listening to the which I never do but I was listening to

00:07:14.08 the most recent episode and you got to start getting your sauces graded you

00:07:18.19 talked about it they work for your times

00:07:21.12 as much if you get a you get a psa 10 uh bts sauce that's

00:07:24.13 you don't need to sell a lot of those to retire did you see that they have a new

00:07:28.00 celebrity meal coming out august 8th no I don't remember who it is but there's a

00:07:33.01 new one coming out with uh different sauces it's clearly working

00:07:36.19 yeah well I'm a big fan of it because [ __ ] okay this is I I have a

00:07:42.02 complaint with mcdonald's that looks like it's a weedy yes it's a

00:07:47.12 big mac and like a four-piece nuggets whatever anyway

00:07:50.03 they were supposed to stop selling I think maybe this is a great argument

00:07:53.12 for what I was saying before they were supposed to stop selling the bts sauce

00:07:57.14 on June 20th and they're still selling it to this day

00:08:00.06 I ordered mcdonald's yesterday and I got two more sauce tanks so I need this new

00:08:04.12 one to come in and push out all the bts sauce because it's still in circulation

00:08:08.07 I needed to be a demand there's still no demand there's still no demand and it's

00:08:12.09 over a month later I think they forgot because June is a very forgettable month

00:08:16.11 ah I just don't I just don't agree with

00:08:18.13 that g there's nothing forgettable about the month of June that's for sure

00:08:22.06 there's a name name a song about June what is the June song happy birthday

00:08:27.10 happy birthday that doesn't count that's not about June

00:08:31.05 my birthday's in June I hear it it counts but it's not about June it's about my

00:08:36.12 birthday which is in June yeah I know but it's not a same I'm talking about a

00:08:41.20 song about the month of June uh hey hey June [Laughter]

00:08:47.18 you're right I apologize it's an iconic hit everyone loves hey June here's a

00:08:53.04 bunch of songs about June by bands I've not heard yeah

00:08:56.23 I've heard of my September song though uh nine songs about the month of June

00:09:02.19 from train to the decemberist to eminem June him by the decemberists drops of

00:09:07.17 Jupiter by train gross June is busting out all over by carousel that sounds

00:09:12.15 gross words I couldn't say by rascal flatts oh wait June in January by none

00:09:17.14 other than dean martin did it again by Shakira and uh

00:09:21.16 her June don't lie eminem sings a song called space bound all about the month of

00:09:27.00 June uh June as does Nicki minaj with dead wrong damn dude that's some heavy

00:09:31.02 hitters I feel like a lot of those are about people named June though and not

00:09:34.19 the month we could do a June mix tape there's so much

00:09:38.23 not nearly as iconic though you get a lot of people named June but not a lot

00:09:44.19 of people called September that's true that's a great point

00:09:47.22 I have a question for you guys okay what do we want to talk about do we want to

00:09:51.11 talk the Olympics are on we talk about the Olympics

00:09:55.14 or we could talk about one of the things I've been most excited about for weeks

00:10:01.01 now that finally happened that I've been avoiding all info on

00:10:05.14 and I I really hope there's I don't see how I could be disappointed

00:10:10.15 but I'm scared that I will be what are you talking about Andrew yeah suddenly

00:10:14.20 that's very weird I was so excited going into this I suddenly just got the

00:10:18.13 feeling that I'm about to be very disappointed the bike trick

00:10:23.14 apparently happened we were lucky enough so so the reason we

00:10:27.18 we're filming this week we weren't gonna I was gonna go abroad but then

00:10:33.05 about 12 hours before going to the airport I decided I wasn't so

00:10:37.00 we actually were able to film the bike trick

00:10:39.21 the bike trick not only did we film it I'd also like to point out another nice

00:10:44.04 thing about today's recording is that the last three recordings we've done

00:10:47.18 have been doubled up so we've done uh double episodes which is great and it

00:10:52.09 was a necessity uh because of this upcoming trip but uh kind of nice to

00:10:57.16 know that we only got to do one today you know yeah we got just like easy

00:11:02.19 peasy just one episode uh yeah but we took advantage of that time and um

00:11:07.09 because Gavin um and I made the plans so

00:11:10.03 last minute we tricked mother nature she wasn't able to [ __ ] on us

00:11:14.12 and uh she did it a different way I'll say that uh Gavin and I picked what must

00:11:19.19 have been the hottest day on earth to sit in a concrete ditch for three hours

00:11:24.19 and watch a progress bar on his camera

00:11:29.22 it was so hot dude the camera was burning my hands it was hard to hold

00:11:34.21 it's black metal I am being I'm not this isn't hyperbole and

00:11:40.13 I'm not exaggerating when I say that uh I had to do the trick or attempt the

00:11:46.01 trick many times throughout the course of the recording

00:11:49.18 to get coverage I would say about halfway in I was afraid I was gonna pass out

00:11:54.20 on the bike I was afraid I was gonna pass out just trying to hold the camera

00:12:00.17 I was trying to bring minimal stuff so I didn't bring I didn't bring a tripod I

00:12:05.00 was just like hanging a camera at my hand with a lens yeah but it's still

00:12:09.00 quite heavy we walked from gavin's house

00:12:10.22 because it we couldn't figure out how to ride two bikes with this 700000 camera

00:12:15.13 so we I walked my bike and Gavin just walked in the backpack from his house a

00:12:19.17 very long way to this ditch uh first of all

00:12:22.19 and uh so we were exhausted before we got there

00:12:26.08 and uh holy [ __ ] man but there was no shade it was just

00:12:30.13 concrete on top of concrete on top of blazing hot ass Texas sun so

00:12:35.05 I want to set the scene a little bit because I still you've described this

00:12:39.15 trick several times I still have no idea

00:12:41.09 what it looks like I don't actually know what you're doing let me be honest with

00:12:45.13 you Andrew I got there and Geoff Geoff was like because I needed to know

00:12:49.15 where to stand to film it yeah Geoff ran me through the trick he was like okay

00:12:53.01 come on come up here I'm gonna come up and go over this and I'm gonna slide

00:12:56.00 down here he explained it to me like in real time

00:12:59.02 I still didn't know what he was gonna do I had to just be like oh you just gotta

00:13:02.11 do it because I don't know what this [ __ ] he goes I explain the

00:13:06.06 trick to him I go this this this and he goes oh so where do I stand and I go

00:13:10.00 you're the [ __ ] cameraman I don't know wherever you stand I'm not gonna do

00:13:13.17 your job for you how are you gonna do the [ __ ] trick

00:13:17.20 see where you're gonna go for the sake of my lens and stuff yeah yeah yeah so

00:13:23.00 here's the deal I've been trying to think about how to tackle

00:13:27.11 explaining this this what what what went down and I think

00:13:30.10 it's better through Gavin I think Gavin you should take the lead on this you in

00:13:34.01 an experience through yeah like what we did how it went like I think this is

00:13:38.02 your story to tell I I was trying to avoid

00:13:40.12 any information on the thing at all like I just I just would you guys

00:13:44.16 I say yeah I text you guys don't tell me anything I want to see it live

00:13:48.12 then I went into the face discord and you guys posted about it on Instagram

00:13:52.02 and that's the only thing I saw and I spoiled myself by going to the face

00:13:55.23 spoilers thing I saw the little place you were in whatever the photo was and I

00:14:00.02 was completely even after seeing the area in which the trick would happen I

00:14:04.12 felt like I was more confused than the verbal description I could not see or

00:14:08.20 tell where a trick would happen or like where you'd land it was baffling so I'm

00:14:14.23 glad that you were still confused Gavin as much as I was upon seeing the

00:14:18.06 location of the area.

00:14:22.06 [Applause]

00:17:23.08 how I first while you're getting this ready how long have we been talking

00:17:27.02 about this stupid trip over a month uh well yeah in real time like a month but

00:17:31.09 in episode time maybe two months yeah probably that's possible yeah

00:17:36.00 probably yeah okay so it's going to be like the culmination of like a

00:17:39.10 probably six six or seven episode arc yeah when these people finally get to

00:17:43.14 see this trick which what I guess I'm gonna say this we roll up on the

00:17:47.12 scene and after Gavin kind of gets the hang of it he goes I'll be honest with

00:17:50.19 you I thought it was gonna be a much smaller trick and that made me feel good

00:17:55.11 a smaller trick is this the most impressive have you

00:17:58.19 ever done a bike trick before this Geoff is this your first trick

00:18:02.00 I'm 46 years old man I've been doing bike tricks my whole life well okay I

00:18:06.06 just I felt like I don't know I'll be honest with you Andrew I think I peaked

00:18:10.03 somewhere around 13. So I think it's all been downhill from then

00:18:14.03 but I used to do a lot of I used to do a lot of bmxing and skating when I was

00:18:18.03 younger for sure and and I'd like it I'd like to to point out that when we watch

00:18:22.17 this trick when we finally get to it I am not driving this is not a trick bike

00:18:28.10 this is like a Cadillac it's a big smooth heavy

00:18:31.16 beautiful just put your hands back behind your bed and ride smooth kind of

00:18:35.15 bike so it doesn't have a lot of maneuverability I'll preface I'll

00:18:39.22 preface it by saying that okay is everyone ready I'm I haven't yes please

00:18:44.12 show me this trick here we go playing the bike stunt here we go how long is

00:18:49.03 this okay so we're in

00:18:56.23 okay wait oh [ __ ]

00:19:02.02 [Applause]

00:19:04.23 That's [ __ ] awesome boom yeah I dropped my kickstand it's back up

00:19:13.18 rolled it out.

00:19:20.18 [Music]

00:19:26.04 Holy [ __ ] let's watch that 100 more times that was amazing so

00:19:32.15 what was your reaction upon seeing the completion of the trick

00:19:37.07 what in real life yeah in real life you get everything there you're feeling the

00:19:43.01 camera uh did it live up to you let me just say

00:19:45.19 before he gets to say that I'll say that he had the benefit of seeing that trick

00:19:49.07 oh I don't know 10 or 15 times because we got to do it

00:19:52.15 he had a front row seat over and over and over again from every angle you can

00:19:57.09 imagine I first want to say a great trick Geoff

00:20:00.20 good job I'm happy that you landed it I don't understand how you could do that

00:20:07.01 15 to 20 times I don't you you went up and over a thing and then you just threw

00:20:12.21 the momentum of going down went over a little yeah you got a little bit of air

00:20:18.02 I well I went I climbed I went up a bank about six feet in the air and then I

00:20:21.15 went down it passed uh passed a bridge into a culvert at this point that's

00:20:26.09 another three feet down and then I went up the other side did a sweet [ __ ]

00:20:30.18 jump and then landed and run it off smooth as can be I just I don't

00:20:34.02 understand what the failed attempts would look like I feel like that's what

00:20:37.14 it is there were there were no failed attempts on that day okay I I when I

00:20:41.09 first saw the trick I did I feel like I just fully didn't

00:20:44.21 know what I was expecting I was expecting him to just basically just do

00:20:48.05 a bunny hop over something so the fact that it extended all this like

00:20:52.05 the fact that he covered so much distance was a shock to me and when he

00:20:56.12 did it I was like all right because I it wasn't like it

00:20:59.13 was a letdown I just fully didn't know what I was gonna see and I assumed it

00:21:02.18 would actually be smaller than what it was so do you think that if it was less

00:21:07.07 distance you'd be less oppressed this is

00:21:09.07 the stretching of the thing the distance covered I was really hoping we would be

00:21:14.02 slow-mowing maybe like an inch and a half of air as Geoff like some sort of

00:21:19.10 water system I don't know but the fact that it was quite long and uh he

00:21:24.06 actually did get quite good air it made it less funny so that's why um

00:21:28.22 that's why I did the punch-ins and the jet sound effects I I mean that added a

00:21:34.23 lot to it I will say one of the I think to me the subtle funny thing of that

00:21:38.12 video is the end when Geoff is riding in slowly and then it goes to slow motion I

00:21:43.00 couldn't tell when the slow motion started he was going at such a slow

00:21:46.12 speed for that that cut in yeah that was

00:21:48.12 unfortunate because of the timing of the music I wanted it to kick into slow-mo

00:21:53.12 when that music kicks in but I had to like extend the run-up just by slowing

00:21:57.09 it down so he he's at like quarter speed coming up to that I see so that's on

00:22:01.05 your end that was and I thought that was

00:22:03.02 just Geoff's natural speed he was booking it up to that bit I was going pretty

00:22:07.03 [ __ ] fast yeah and uh and I'd like to point out too uh that the point of this

00:22:11.19 trick was never to go and find a cool trick and do it's that I ride my bike

00:22:15.18 through that ditch every [ __ ] day or probably five or six days a week and

00:22:20.00 you just like you ride over the same spots over and over again you want to do

00:22:22.23 you want to just like you get bored so I

00:22:23.20 was like I bet I could ride up there and then but then I'd get stuck in this

00:22:27.10 culvert and then you're like oh can I jump my way out of the cover and then

00:22:30.15 you're like oh I guess I could you tried a few times slowly and you fall

00:22:33.17 uh and I showed Gavin how I wiped out on the on the on the wall that I rode and

00:22:38.00 kind of explained to him how how that wipe out went and which was a [ __ ]

00:22:42.08 terrible and terrifying wipe out let me tell you and uh

00:22:45.22 but it was more of just like you just like like driving my bike by

00:22:49.16 that every day and just having it like itch at you it's actually like I want to

00:22:51.20 do something more fun here than just go down this path and then I came up with

00:22:55.07 this awesome [ __ ] badass trick and then I did it and then I did it a

00:22:58.03 billion times for Gavin and that wasn't even the best air I got the best air I

00:23:02.16 got was huge but we decided to redo it for some reason wait was the best air on

00:23:07.01 like uh when I was filming the first bit I think it was the time before that one

00:23:10.20 yeah you're probably a little bit far away yeah I wanted to get you nice and

00:23:14.12 big in frame I I that's I mean that was a trick for sure I don't

00:23:19.08 know what I feel like you let down Andrew it's not that I'm let down it was

00:23:23.20 a great I don't know you know like my favorite part is that the bike

00:23:28.03 clearly not at all design it like it lands and it almost like snaps in half

00:23:33.20 and the kickstand comes down and bashes the ground the chain goes out

00:23:38.00 in every slo-mo shot we have you can see

00:23:40.13 some in some of the other ones the chain

00:23:43.09 is like 80 on the ground it's it somehow puts itself back together

00:23:47.04 I I think I'm it's not that I'm underwhelmed I think I'm whelmed it was

00:23:52.08 what I was expecting you well it's an overwhelming bike trick Geoff it was

00:23:55.19 overwhelming it was a solid uh it was it's very much that they were who

00:24:00.21 we thought they were moment like it is what I thought it was and uh it was good

00:24:06.12 the edit I mean great video great bike trick Geoff I'm what I want

00:24:09.19 is the continuation of this because you said you go through that all the time

00:24:14.06 and you're expanding is there more for you to do is there more ground to cover

00:24:18.00 I doubt 100100 okay yeah there's there's a lot there's more opportunity

00:24:21.19 therefore so like a year from now we might get multiple zigzags you might be

00:24:25.10 zigging up and down this could be an expanded trick this is

00:24:28.14 just like the trial run it's entirely possible for sure

00:24:32.01 uh I it's it but you gotta you can't force it you know you gotta let uh

00:24:35.16 inspiration strike I feel like it was somehow simultaneously more and less of

00:24:39.22 a trick than you thought it would be at the same time Andrew it is

00:24:44.06 uh there's more to it uh I just I think it's the bike is the

00:24:47.23 thing too I need to consider as you said not designed to do that it almost

00:24:51.11 explodes on impact which is very funny if I was on if I was on a tiny like my

00:24:55.06 little like a little trick bike yeah I would have been at first I thought I got

00:24:59.01 about four feet higher on the jump it would have been it would have been way

00:25:03.07 easier to get up and to go over that uh over that drainage ditch that my bike

00:25:06.10 does not turn that fast and it's like you can't really see it but the angle I

00:25:10.04 gotta come out of that out of that uh tunnel

00:25:13.06 and then make the hard cut it's very difficult

00:25:16.23 now does the pedal assist help with the speed

00:25:18.21 how much is that influencing your height I would say the pedal assist provides

00:25:23.15 most of the help at the beginning to get through the tunnel and up that ramp and

00:25:27.10 then it's just gravity and pedal and me oh wait after that how far down the

00:25:31.18 tunnel are you oh I'm very far yeah oh that's okay see that's a whole lair I

00:25:35.11 didn't realize that's not shown I just assumed you were waiting and then you

00:25:38.21 pop out okay like a bullet I came out of that tunnel

00:25:41.22 well he's not a pedal assist bike Gavin I don't know what that means as far as

00:25:45.20 distance goes you just came out I came out of the ball

00:25:48.13 I came out of the tunnel hauling ass it's remember it's slowed down to like a

00:25:53.14 quarter speed or something okay that was a great trick five percent

00:25:56.16 speed I think what you're missing and hopefully Gavin will understand is when

00:26:01.03 you stand in this space and you see the totality of it you see like when you're

00:26:05.15 in the ditch and you see how tall and big everything is around you then you

00:26:09.11 understand the scale of what's going on which is a totally different thing I you

00:26:13.19 know I agree honestly it's warming up to me over time I think I needed time to

00:26:18.08 process the trick really understand the specifics of it I'm not a big bike guy

00:26:22.07 I added just hearing the extent bringing up great details of the pedal and

00:26:25.19 knowing the speeds you've sold me on this that is that's a great trick and

00:26:29.16 I'm very excited about the extension of this going forward like a year from now

00:26:34.10 attempt it yourself on the same bike that Geoff's on like

00:26:37.20 that type of bike yeah I've never ridden that type of I don't know I don't know

00:26:41.18 what that'd be like so it's hard for me what yeah I think I would because I if I

00:26:45.18 eat [ __ ] I eat [ __ ] well I also if you guys are interested I have a bmx in

00:26:50.08 storage I can pull out and pump the tires up and then we can just we can

00:26:54.23 just start getting tricky I wanna okay I wanna know what getting tricky means

00:26:59.19 to you I'm very excited about this I'd love for you to get tricky Geoff we can

00:27:04.00 just start like making that a focus of things you know it's not like I don't

00:27:07.14 have 46 years of daily bike riding behind me I may not be in the weeds I

00:27:11.15 may but now I may not be at the 9th street trails in Austin hitting [ __ ]

00:27:15.12 table tops and stuff at this age but I still I still have the

00:27:19.04 cumulative experience of all of my bicycle knowledge and uh all the dumb

00:27:22.21 [ __ ] I've done in the past I'm all about raw

00:27:25.04 listen you put a camera in front of me

00:27:27.00 and I'm on a bike I'll I'll do some [ __ ]

00:27:28.21 could you do could you get air and then like spin the handlebars that's the

00:27:33.03 thing they do right that's a bike never tried that in my life yet okay

00:27:38.04 but I would what so are we so you get on the trick

00:27:41.11 bike are you trying to reclaim former glory or are we like we're going into

00:27:45.09 uncharted territory we're trying some tricks

00:27:50.04 there's no former glory to attain it's more of like is it fun

00:27:56.06 and is it footage and so far in my experience uh the answer to both

00:28:02.15 questions was yes like Gavin and I actually cause we were in

00:28:07.22 that ditch for I don't know 11 hours maybe it was it was a lot of effort yeah

00:28:14.15 is that we were joking about how much effort it was for how little reward

00:28:20.14 probably but also how much [ __ ] fun that amount of effort for that

00:28:25.13 production was and like we both were like I wish we could do this more often

00:28:28.16 I wish we could come up with other dumb things to film and put this much effort

00:28:32.11 into it for such a stupid thing yeah I'm not really into the idea of all these

00:28:36.01 little side bits that we do especially now we have a YouTube channel is that

00:28:38.23 where we're going to put this stuff on Instagram yeah no no I think I think

00:28:42.16 YouTube I think you can go on Instagram as well but I think this is definitely I

00:28:45.19 could make you a square version for Instagram if you want that'd be great

00:28:49.06 yeah we could put that up on the on the on the socials and then we'll put the

00:28:53.00 full video uh in all its glory up on YouTube uh uh I want to know what Eric

00:28:57.09 thought of it Eric and nick if they if they hadn't

00:28:59.19 yeah please please please uh that was not the type of bike that I was

00:29:04.06 anticipating you riding and doing a trick on uh

00:29:07.02 when the kickstand hits the ground and then comes back up I thought the rest of

00:29:12.12 the bike was gonna explode I was like I was worried for you landing on that

00:29:16.17 front tire so hard like yeah I know you would have told us like yeah and then I

00:29:21.14 just went like you know over the front and ate [ __ ]

00:29:24.12 like if that's what happened but like man the way your front tire hit I was

00:29:29.07 like oh that's the opposite of tricks that was the least clean run we did

00:29:34.08 and it was the only one where I I tried to tabletop it a bit in the air and I

00:29:40.04 ended up landing further on the on the front tire in the back uh and uh two

00:29:44.00 things one uh probably one of the less impressive of the jumps because of that

00:29:48.23 uh was also why I think we should use it because it uh it was goofy also hurt

00:29:54.00 hurt you know it looks like you see like all

00:29:56.20 of the compression through the bike like first the front tire is like pretty

00:30:00.08 square on landing the the back tire if you watch it it gets totally bent to

00:30:05.05 like the left and then your wrist is like the next

00:30:08.08 thing to receive the impact let your sunglasses drop down it's like you can

00:30:12.13 see the shock wave traveling all through the bike into the top of your head it's

00:30:16.17 great yeah I felt it from my right wrist up to my elbow for at least 24 hours we

00:30:21.12 did different angles of the jump like this there's like a closer up angle but

00:30:26.00 it was a much cleaner landing and it wasn't nearly as funny as that other

00:30:30.17 wide shot so I just left it on that I I will say that uh besides like the jump

00:30:36.17 my favorite part of the video is you I I guess like

00:30:43.01 sliding in at the end and just how long that goes on for a very long time a very

00:30:51.16 long time sliding in the face music is like 30

00:30:56.17 seconds

00:31:01.07 it's long it's a long ending right I want to watch it six more times that's

00:31:06.02 the pro I want to see every the people listening to this get the joy of

00:31:10.15 analyzing it I want to see Geoff's face on impact I mean I could give you an

00:31:15.14 analysis an analyst analysis pass if you want a second

00:31:19.12 viewing I'll also say too my favorite part of the video is something that no

00:31:23.02 one has pointed out yet Gavin noticed it immediately uh but nobody else has

00:31:27.02 pointed out I think the the low-key best part of the video what is your favorite

00:31:30.17 part let's see if you notice it on on another pass oh are we doing a second

00:31:34.10 pass I'd love to do a second pass it takes like 20 minutes to get to the yeah

00:31:37.20 I don't know that we have to I just was wearing a it was just the shirt I was

00:31:40.21 wearing okay let's do it if it just immediately works I'm all about it

00:31:45.11 okay this is great so let's reevaluate the second thing so you're far down the

00:31:50.17 tunnel I appreciate there's no showing how far the tunnel gets so we're just

00:31:54.00 gonna have to assume that you're far down well I mean in an analysis point of

00:31:57.16 view this is actually in slow motion at the beginning I only have a it only

00:32:00.22 records for five seconds so Geoff is like

00:32:03.04 here it's just in slow-mo and I speed up and he shoots out all right you ready

00:32:08.02 now let's pass okay really long tunnel the for the frame look at look at just

00:32:13.16 positioning the back the legs perfect landing it's the audio commentary

00:32:21.18 through the air Geoff looks surprised and a little bit fearful

00:32:26.02 clips a few leaves I'm just I was looking at the bike last time I'm purely

00:32:31.11 looking at Geoff this time impact immediate in the hands of euvd in the face

00:32:37.20 where did you get that shirt hey oh I got a [ __ ] awesome shirt is

00:32:42.04 what I got yeah where did you get that where's the green shirt get that I

00:32:47.05 bought it on eBay no way yeah I bought there's a whole there's I

00:32:51.11 got more than that there are multiple don zimmer shirts available to buy

00:32:56.15 uh awesome I know if we could figure out

00:32:59.16 a way to license that shirt I would love to make a face version I mean would it

00:33:03.08 just be a case of contacting that photo probably probably contacting a

00:33:06.18 photographer it's [ __ ] is it like we should sell that I mean I'm sure the I

00:33:10.19 bought it on eBay dude I'm sure it's not an official shirt but we should

00:33:13.22 officially sell that shirt it's [ __ ]

00:33:15.18 awesome dude I look good I look young I like fit I like healthy I gotta tan

00:33:20.20 watch that one watch the back tire here that was no that's the first thing I

00:33:25.14 watched it lands on like the the the screw bit bounces and wiggles over us

00:33:30.21 god damn it hurt I really thought the trade popped off the first time I

00:33:35.14 watched it it it does it just pops itself back on

00:33:39.16 every time god damn dude and that was legit maybe the 14th attempt I think it

00:33:45.01 was the eighth or eighth I was running on empty by the end yeah after that one

00:33:51.01 like you're all hunched over to the side in my head I was like

00:33:52.10 he's gonna eat [ __ ] on the next one

00:33:58.02 although eating [ __ ] would have looked

00:34:00.12 amazing at that frame rate I gotta say I felt like there was no way for this

00:34:04.16 trick to live up to the hype just because of the unfortunate uh way that

00:34:09.05 we recorded the summer and we just had to keep pushing it off but I'm still but

00:34:13.07 but that being said I'm I think we did about as good a a job with it as

00:34:17.05 possible it was a surprise because in my head this was going one of two ways so

00:34:21.07 it's either gonna be way way more impressive than I could

00:34:24.11 have imagined or like Gavin said you're gonna get an inch of air off this little

00:34:27.17 jump and it would have been funny in a completely different way you landed

00:34:30.23 perfectly in the middle it's a good trick not the greatest thing I've ever

00:34:36.12 seen impact fantastic what is the best bike trick you've ever done Gavin um

00:34:40.10 I'm not sure I've ever done a bike trick

00:34:42.13 oh I used to do that thing was it ghosty

00:34:45.02 I don't know what that is I have no idea you like to start riding your bike down

00:34:48.23 a hill and then you jump off and it keeps going and then you run and try and

00:34:52.21 catch up with it and get back on it before it

00:34:56.04 crashes into a parked car that's an awesome trick I've never seen before you

00:34:59.12 gotta do how do I film uh find me a hill

00:35:01.22 okay and I'll you'll teach me how to use the phantom

00:35:06.19 yeah I feel like this is a great little window into like it's like a new avenue

00:35:11.22 of little shitty high effort side content yeah yeah it's like

00:35:17.09 face originals is that what we called it

00:35:20.10 and also it was it was nice to uh like as we were walking out there we're just

00:35:24.15 talking about face we talk about some different aspects of the show we were

00:35:28.23 talking about how it's it's kind of sad that we can't

00:35:31.21 easily record with Andrew in person but we will also talk about how much fun it

00:35:35.19 is Andrew just to imagine you and probably the imagination like our own

00:35:39.22 imagination of you is way better than the real you potentially wow I don't

00:35:44.12 know how to react to that well the thing is I've met I've met you twice um and

00:35:48.21 you know it's been fine one of the times you didn't talk to me or stand up

00:35:51.20 because you were stuck in a chair and the other time I assumed it was the

00:35:55.07 first time we met and it was very brief so all of my best experiences with you

00:35:59.05 have been just your voice and imagining you in

00:36:02.08 person that's true we've definitely spent more time in that space but I mean

00:36:06.15 that's for all yes this is the distance but who knows you might you might be a

00:36:11.22 blast in person I don't know what that means

00:36:14.03 I don't need the fact that I don't okay well if you don't I was gonna say I

00:36:17.05 don't know if that means I'm not I don't know what you mean by that I just

00:36:21.11 haven't spent that much time with you okay

00:36:23.13 you guys are in constant communication yeah we spend time together constantly I

00:36:27.14 mean in real life you don't spend any time with me in real life dude

00:36:32.04 what do you imagine is going on like what what levels of fun

00:36:36.10 what is what are you missing in the physical experience what are you hoping

00:36:41.14 for I don't know I just feel like the the little snippets of your life that we

00:36:46.00 hear about or see in picture form okay you want to be in my kitchen at 1am with

00:36:51.07 a kettle stuck on a ramen bowl is what you're saying I think that is I think

00:36:55.01 what he's saying is and and if I'm hearkening back to the conversation we

00:36:59.01 had the imagining you going through these situations is probably more fun

00:37:04.00 than seeing it in person but it would still be fun to see in person yeah I

00:37:09.11 just it's going back to like how the audience all thought you sat in the dark

00:37:13.19 it's like it's the imagination of you that's so intriguing yeah yeah

00:37:17.22 but it's not like we I mean like I could be if I let we should do this for an

00:37:21.10 episode one day I'm not gonna do it right now I don't have the energy but if

00:37:24.13 I I could probably walk out of my house right now get in my car and drive to

00:37:29.09 gavin's house and be there in less than seven minutes

00:37:32.06 but not but we don't ever ever ever ever do that like we never spend time

00:37:37.06 together in person yeah I mean there's a that's been a good excuse we have spent

00:37:41.12 a lot of the last decade I mean we lived

00:37:43.20 together for several years yeah but yeah yeah I guess that's true

00:37:48.15 I guess I'm discounting all the time that we live together

00:37:52.00 I was reminded of some of a situation the other day it might

00:37:55.08 have been in your drinking days I'm not sure if you remember it it probably was

00:37:58.15 it was in the morning I just woke up it's probably like a Saturday I assume

00:38:02.08 you'd been up for a bit it was probably like 830

00:38:04.14 and I walk out into the main living room and I think you're playing

00:38:08.13 playing some video game and I and you were like the couch layout you were like

00:38:12.16 sat slightly in front like where you were on the tv and I just sat on like

00:38:17.12 the corner of the couch in the back and I and I was like oh and you made

00:38:21.09 you made some sort of noise as if to acknowledge me and I think poppins was

00:38:25.18 there too like it was that long ago and then I was

00:38:29.01 watching you play for a bit and you were away

00:38:32.04 and then I said something about the game you were playing I was like

00:38:35.14 what does it mean when you do that and you went

00:38:38.06 and you didn't know I was there and it turns out the acknowledgement noise

00:38:41.14 you'd either been like saying something to the dog or you just made like a grunt

00:38:45.01 or something that was completely irrelevant to me you had no idea that

00:38:48.23 I'd come out of my room and sat behind you

00:38:51.03 and we scared the [ __ ] out of each other and that was like some of the joyous

00:38:54.15 moments of us living together do you remember that at all no I don't

00:38:59.01 remember that at all that I if it was poppins though I remember the house

00:39:03.15 we've spent thousands of days together it's true what I'm with Andrew I'm at

00:39:08.05 two and so much of it was focused on making content together too like so much

00:39:12.01 it was us building [ __ ] in mine craft or whatever for the other job

00:39:15.09 yeah it was usually like at least a few hours every Saturday and

00:39:19.04 Sunday we'd be in mine craft I just I remembered there's another time we spent

00:39:24.04 together Gavin and you made fun of you laughed at me so I don't feel like

00:39:28.23 you're missing out on the no it's not what you said you laughed at

00:39:34.15 my actions we went to an arcade it was you Caleb and I went to pinballs one

00:39:38.04 time oh and we were rotating out I don't know if you'll remember this we're

00:39:41.20 rotating out on a time crisis machine and I held the gun like you're supposed

00:39:45.22 to hold a gun and you Caleb just laughed

00:39:49.01 at me that was the reason that so that's that's an experience you had but I also

00:39:52.15 wasn't a fun time I remember I found there's like a what do you call

00:39:56.14 like the quarter machine like the coin is it a coin pusher where like the thing

00:40:00.08 goes in and out and you drop coins into it yeah and you're trying to get usually

00:40:03.15 like tokens and yeah I didn't have I like I just had a 20 bill on me and I

00:40:07.22 was like I'll just put 20 into this and that got me like ten thousand coins so I

00:40:11.22 spent the entire time just sat at this wizard of oz machine well you guys went

00:40:16.00 around and had fun and did stuff but I was gonna get all the cards

00:40:20.04 Andrew honest question what are the chances that I wasn't there uh you were

00:40:24.02 percent there absolutely I have absolutely no memory of it we picked you

00:40:28.08 up and then we drove the pinballs and then jack showed up later who did you

00:40:32.10 actually pick up [Laughter]

00:40:34.12 it was you or is this during your drinking days Gavin this is when we're

00:40:38.12 gonna find out that this is where we're gonna find out this

00:40:41.16 entire time Andrew thought Gavin was dan

00:40:45.03 grishi or ben king yeah do you know some other British guy we know

00:40:49.20 I do I didn't go I was I was never a pinballs with you you 100 were at

00:40:53.17 pinballz with me we need to get ah [ __ ]

00:40:56.06 we need to ask I was gonna say we Caleb but he died years ago what about we

00:40:59.21 could ask a minor league fan jack but we

00:41:03.11 already did that bit I could I could try to call Caleb I don't know yeah

00:41:08.10 I'm like 99 sure I've never been to pinballs with you you are you 100 a

00:41:12.22 hundred percent should we put money on it should we wait I would wager I would

00:41:18.04 put anything on it surely I'd have pictures of that no there we didn't like

00:41:22.09 as I said I spent I understand why you'd not think I was there because I was

00:41:27.03 married to a wizard of oz machine like 80 of our experience.

00:41:33.01 I like I like pimples because uh nobody goes there to play pinball

00:41:37.16 no I went to the pinball machine and it was fun there's a bunch there's a

00:41:42.12 great but you're right pinball pibble's great I really like pinball it's like

00:41:47.10 the best thing to go do but you like owning a machine is a nightmare from

00:41:50.18 what I understand like it's one of the worst investments you can have just

00:41:54.06 because of the constant maintenance especially the old ones you can't get a

00:41:58.00 lot of parts hey remind me before we end this podcast I want to take a point of

00:42:02.10 personal privilege to do a clarification on some condiment stuff uh but but not

00:42:07.01 in a bad way oh what was what was the reaction to uh

00:42:10.19 your participation in the condiment segment well I so I I'll

00:42:15.09 let me just say if you want to get into it now if we're done with the pinball

00:42:19.07 saga I still think I'm about to sort of bet I agree well

00:42:22.11 let's see I just I would love to know who you pick I'm gonna call Caleb right

00:42:25.15 now yeah please call Caleb right now uh and I guess I should says Caleb is uh if

00:42:29.21 you're listening to this podcast and you

00:42:31.14 don't know who the [ __ I Caleb is uh why would you can you hear me

00:42:36.00 I can hear you okay do you remember Caleb Caleb you gotta let him know

00:42:39.10 you're on you're on a podcast Caleb you're uh I already I told him that

00:42:43.05 already he knows he's on no you didn't hear it because I missed it doesn't

00:42:47.09 matter do you remember when we went to pinballs

00:42:49.16 to pinball yeah it's the first time I I went to Austin I stayed with you we went

00:42:53.17 to pinballs he took me to pinballs I mean it sounds about right I honestly

00:42:57.11 don't have a recollection of it though that's unfortunate for me

00:43:01.10 you took me to pinball so we picked up Gavin and we all went the pinballs Gavin

00:43:05.22 says it never happened it definitely happened definitely happened

00:43:10.00 you do not sound confident I'm confident because I know I've gone to pinballs

00:43:13.12 with you and I know I've gone to pinballs with Gavin and so

00:43:17.21 chances are that you were both there but I don't remember if you both were there

00:43:21.09 okay that that's not a that's not confirmation he's like he's like hold up

00:43:25.04 his kid's talking he's like hold on sweetie daddy's lying real fast uh I'd

00:43:29.05 first like to point out how much Andrew nailed having someone on speakerphone

00:43:33.16 come through discord that was uh that's not hard it's not I

00:43:36.21 don't know how Geoff balls it up with jack you point the thing at the mic uh

00:43:41.01 that's what I did so sorry what your condiments you want

00:43:44.14 to talk about condiments I was I missed I don't think I don't think that was a I

00:43:47.23 don't think coley Caleb has proved anything no it didn't it confirms that

00:43:52.09 he's with the pinballs it reminded me that Caleb is content cancer

00:43:56.21 he was good for that no he's not hi I'm kidding I'm kidding I'm kidding we

00:44:01.01 made a video with Caleb that I think is great yeah he's a little he's a little

00:44:05.01 screen looker Andrew name anything else that happened

00:44:08.19 at pinball's that would trigger my memory like a conversation we had

00:44:13.10 okay so uh what is that that game we also did the thing where uh you the the

00:44:17.22 lift goes up and you got to get the key through the hole to win the prize it's

00:44:20.23 at the front at that time was at the front of the arcade I did that and you

00:44:24.12 watched everybody watched and then the guy there's somebody who recognized you

00:44:28.02 guys and he ran over and yelled at me was

00:44:30.13 like no don't do it it's not ready yet like that machine will not give you

00:44:34.23 anything do not put money into that you know why I 100 remember that I remember

00:44:39.11 that that was you playing I was playing I was the only key you

00:44:42.19 were pointing I believe at the thing to try to give me a point of reference of

00:44:46.17 where I was before yeah and I will go through the slot every like thousand

00:44:51.02 attempts yeah and he was like it's nowhere close to being at that thousands

00:44:54.17 attempt like the guy it was like I was about to die or something to like step

00:44:58.09 on a land mine and the guy was like no don't stop just see my head that was

00:45:02.16 jack that was saying it's not ready no well jack was there too he came in in

00:45:07.09 the middle but it was we picked you up and we dropped you off

00:45:11.11 you're absolutely right why would I make that up what a weird it

00:45:16.13 was me I have that memory but you're not there

00:45:21.07 that's so messed up I wonder who I replaced you with jack apparently

00:45:26.00 yeah you are you yeah but it wasn't jack playing in my ah you copied and pasted

00:45:32.12 jack over andrew's face in your memory man what

00:45:36.03 we've hung out more than I remember I mean not a lot like it's gone from two

00:45:41.07 times to three times but yeah that is that dude that's a 50 increase yeah that

00:45:45.09 is true I'm excited for the next time we

00:45:47.14 hang out I like yeah we need to figure I feel like there's going to be a lot of

00:45:52.08 pressure oh not only oh [ __ ] not only oh my god

00:45:56.15 Caleb has a [ __ ] picture of it and he put it up with a date April 17th

00:46:01.16 2015 there's Gavin free and Andrew pen ton

00:46:06.02 next standing next to each other playing time crisis

00:46:09.22 and you both look by the way you both look very unhappy

00:46:14.19 it was I think it was the first no I guess the second night I don't know I

00:46:20.00 don't remember I'll be honest Andrew I had no idea that there was a picture of

00:46:23.14 us together it existed I didn't know that either I had no idea I just

00:46:29.07 damn what I think is fascinating is that what I remember about that experience

00:46:34.12 you've disregarded and the thing that I had to like dig up and right try to

00:46:38.08 refine in my brain was like that was the moment for you

00:46:41.12 so now what was the what were the terms when Gavin lie you have to eat the dead

00:46:47.12 wasps now right is that what we said that has blown my mind Andrew there's a

00:46:53.07 picture of us together yeah oh I mean that yeah

00:46:55.21 it exists I don't know what to say this is not at all extraordinary to me this

00:46:59.13 is just the memory I have you know your nose does look sturdy I'll give you that

00:47:05.14 very sturdy nose oh god our friend Caleb delivers again I always

00:47:10.09 say that that guy's content gold yep that's what you always say oh man wow

00:47:16.21 but now I feel like I feel like such a knob now Andrew I'm sorry I'm sorry

00:47:22.17 hey no that's fine I don't it was uneventful as I said my memory is you

00:47:28.09 guys laughing at me so it's okay it's fine that you've erased it so you were

00:47:32.11 holding the gun firearm that's most of my memory of you guys I was

00:47:36.11 you doing like trigger discipline well that's the thing I don't I've never

00:47:40.00 really watched anyone else play like gun games I assume they hold the gun like

00:47:43.04 you're supposed to hold a gun and you guys thought I was taking it way too

00:47:46.17 seriously I guess I just thought I was playing the game [Laughter]

00:47:51.14 it's not my fault you're lazy at gun games [Laughter]

00:47:57.09 wow Caleb has impressed me a lot with that

00:48:01.16 what a fun little episode this this what a little great little gift this turned

00:48:06.12 out to be I want to know about the condiments because I feel like oh we

00:48:09.22 keep like right and then pulling away yeah so I should preface by saying uh

00:48:15.03 I listened to that episode uh as I heard my girlfriend listening to it as well

00:48:20.10 and uh after she listened that episode uh she had a

00:48:24.07 goddamn intervention with me about whether I'm uh depressed and and and

00:48:28.18 miserable or not in life and uh sure I'm gonna I'm in a lovely place right now

00:48:33.02 but I will admit that uh that that I sound particularly down in that episode

00:48:37.12 and I'd like to say that part of it I think and I don't know if you guys have

00:48:40.15 listened to the most recent episode with the condiment fight I remember it

00:48:44.21 there's somewhere between and I I don't want to aggrandize but I think there's

00:48:50.15 legitimately somewhere between five and 20 minutes of me yelling at you guys

00:48:55.12 that nick very rightly cut out I think it's a

00:48:59.07 masterpiece by nick's part for how that episode turned out compared to what it

00:49:04.00 was like recording it there's a lot of uh me articulating the finer points of

00:49:08.21 my argument that got cut uh which is totally fine I think I think

00:49:13.12 I think it's not where I think you're going with the best possible job

00:49:17.07 of cutting that episode together but it goes from me like ramping up and then

00:49:20.15 suddenly I'm very defeated and you miss the part where I explode over and over

00:49:24.11 again and get tired and and so I I feel very I look very defeated at the end of

00:49:28.18 it and I guess I was not to mention the fact that it also happened like right

00:49:32.15 around the time that like my uncle died and I had to go out of town and I was

00:49:36.15 doing a lot of traveling and juggling and uh everything in my house was on

00:49:40.08 fire and I was just like kind of particularly beat down and then I went

00:49:44.06 on vacation and I feel [ __ I great right now so I had to I had to sway

00:49:47.09 absolutely emily's fears I was worried that that one couldn't come out because

00:49:51.20 it was it like none of this is funny if the anger is

00:49:56.02 real in my opinion and it was it was getting real nick cleaned up

00:50:00.21 some of the more real stuff and I actually sent him a message afterwards I

00:50:04.18 was like wow you completely saved that episode I don't know how you did it that

00:50:08.02 must have been like surgery but because of uh because of a lot of it being cut

00:50:12.12 including a lot of like my the point of my arguments and the meat of my

00:50:15.17 arguments there are two there are two little inconsistencies that have that

00:50:19.11 I've seen pop up over and over again by comment leavers that I would just like

00:50:24.13 to clarify point point but take a point of personal privilege to clarify

00:50:29.11 uh one people seem to be I guess by the way I wrote

00:50:31.20 my initial recipe or the way it was written or read people seemed to get the

00:50:35.11 impression that the tater tots were a part of the recipe they never were the

00:50:40.17 tater tots were we were designing the ultimate condiment for tater tots it was

00:50:44.18 a tot dipper or a hot sauce and so people keep saying like like approaching

00:50:48.18 it like I was saying part of the my recipe is to create tater tots it wasn't

00:50:53.02 you gotta take that out of the con out of the like the tater tots are there in

00:50:56.09 gavin's meal they're there and andrew's meal as well so you can't you can't hit

00:51:00.11 me for cooking tater tots that's I think that that's just ludicrous I mean it

00:51:04.19 comes down in general to the fact that the whole thing started from France

00:51:09.04 which is flash dressing and ranch and we and the conversation was which

00:51:12.07 condiments would you mix together to make the ultimate condiment and we just

00:51:15.12 didn't tell you that that was the origin of it that's the other that's the other

00:51:19.12 part of the conversation it was just it was just omitted because we were all

00:51:22.23 internet to begin with I think that that's the other thing that gets dropped

00:51:26.10 and the other point I wanted to make is I had no

00:51:28.17 access to this french conversation I had no con I had no breaking bad content

00:51:34.15 convert like context it literally started for me when Andrew said could

00:51:38.05 you design the ultimate condiment and I said so I'd have to build a condiment

00:51:41.09 and you go whatever you want make a condiment so I didn't understand the

00:51:44.13 context or the history behind it I was just trying to make a condiment the only

00:51:48.21 rules I was given were make the ultimate condiment for

00:51:52.13 tater tots and in my head as soon as I heard tater tots out that ketchup or

00:51:55.18 cheese that ketchup seemed like too easy an easy route to go so I went with

00:51:59.06 cheese and I went down the cheese route but I just want to make those two points

00:52:03.07 of clarification you stopped telling me that I misunderstood the franchise

00:52:06.12 because I never heard the french argument one and then

00:52:09.18 everyone else kind of did the same thing though I think you went way out on left

00:52:15.01 field I do like that you're too clear no this isn't this isn't

00:52:19.23 not heated at all in any way uh the the thing that you're saying is

00:52:24.04 about to get me heated and unfair I I was trying to be very uh magnanimous

00:52:28.07 about it I was just trying to clear up these two little points of conversation

00:52:32.06 the only information I was given is design the ultimate condiment that's I

00:52:35.17 didn't have I didn't have the same information you all did you did not have

00:52:39.10 the franchise I assumed nick probably had a little bit more of that french

00:52:42.23 context than I did no he did not you're the same as you did I

00:52:47.00 think the thing is when I say that it's like it's not fun if the anger is real I

00:52:50.14 feel like yeah I should also clarify like when when we do get annoyed at

00:52:54.01 stuff in the episode or when stuff is frustrating in our lives it is like it

00:52:59.01 is real anger like it is like we're not just pretending

00:53:02.07 but it's when the anger ends with man do

00:53:05.00 I even want to make this podcast anymore that's what I feel like it's it's gone

00:53:08.15 too far it's not like we're pretending all the rest of the time it's just like

00:53:11.16 you don't want it to be you don't just have a detrimental effect on the people

00:53:16.00 for sure for sure sure yeah absolutely that wasn't even for me a thing of anger

00:53:19.17 I was just more confused by everything that was happening I didn't understand

00:53:24.13 what was going on or why no nobody was more confused than me from uh the

00:53:29.07 constant gas lighting and uh there is no gas lighting it's confusing like no

00:53:34.05 okay no no I'm not doing a bit but if you want to get into it like you

00:53:37.12 literally are telling me see I think you've designed a lovely condiment but

00:53:40.19 what we're asking for is a sauce and then later on you tell me this is a

00:53:44.04 sauce not a condiment there was a lot of confusing uh

00:53:47.12 conversation going around left and right there

00:53:49.22 so I don't look I don't want to get upset again all I wanted to say is that

00:53:55.01 I all I wanted to say is that I don't think it's fair

00:53:57.14 for people to complain that tater tots are a part of my recipe because they

00:54:01.12 were a part of everybody's recipe for sure I nobody told me about the french

00:54:06.03 conversation they just said make a condiment yeah that's all that's fair

00:54:10.01 and so I made a condiment I made a condiment for tater tots because that's

00:54:13.01 what I was asked to do well even though that bit didn't go the way that we'd

00:54:17.07 originally planned would you be offended Geoff if in future

00:54:20.23 I do make your top condiment any it on a

00:54:23.16 show would I be offended well like is it gonna bring up

00:54:26.23 you know is it gonna bring up the past because I actually I genuinely want to

00:54:30.01 eat that like yeah it sounds like there was never a question of is it good what

00:54:35.12 you made sounds delicious is it uh is it if you do it no if Andrew does it

00:54:41.01 probably

00:54:42.21 if I'm just being honest because I know how you would treat it and handle it and

00:54:46.19 deal with it and I know how he would and you would be respectful and he would be

00:54:51.12 funny okay now I don't know how to process that because I wouldn't

00:54:56.04 you process it over however you feel it's not meant to be an insult I just I

00:55:01.03 just think I know both of your sense of humors I know how you handle situations

00:55:05.02 and I think that I would I think Gavin would be a little uh Gavin knows me uh

00:55:10.05 better than just about anybody and I think that he would handle it in a way

00:55:13.11 that would keep me from blowing my top maybe it would be

00:55:17.07 maybe it should be the first thing we do in person oh

00:55:20.12 a cooking like a cooking statement no just like they're in the middle of

00:55:25.05 the table yeah once again I don't want to get into a

00:55:28.12 whole I don't want to get into a sauce versus condiment versus dipping sauce

00:55:32.07 versus whether I was taking it too far or whatever all I'm saying that was

00:55:36.00 never what I didn't I didn't know about the french

00:55:39.04 conversation I didn't understand the breaking bad of it it was never

00:55:43.20 communicated to me and it's it's weird that people would say my my

00:55:47.17 my dipping sauce or my condiment was too complicated because you have to make

00:55:51.12 potato tots because that was a part of it for everybody I just want to be

00:55:54.12 judged on the same merits as everyone else I

00:55:57.15 like that Geoff's two clarifications were

00:56:00.19 the audience is wrong for assuming this and also you guys are wrong and it was

00:56:05.02 edited out why I was so right those are your two clarifications no my

00:56:09.09 clarification is the audience seems to has misconstrued

00:56:12.20 that tater tots were a part of my ingredient were a part of the process

00:56:16.05 and they're not and two that I wasn't a part of the

00:56:19.00 french conversation those are my only two points of clarity and I don't think

00:56:22.13 and I don't think that those that is that on the audience in any way I'm just

00:56:26.03 cleaning up a miscommunication I even gave the audience the benefit of the

00:56:29.09 doubt and I said I can understand how they would draw those conclusions

00:56:32.23 because of nick's amazing job of editing it but he edited out the vast majority

00:56:37.18 of that conversation and once again rightly so so I just

00:56:41.07 wanted to clear up those two little things it's not an attack on the

00:56:44.13 audience or it's not attack on either of you I feel like I was polite and

00:56:47.16 respectful to everyone involved what I've learned from this experience is I I

00:56:52.17 would put and I didn't know this I would now put

00:56:55.06 definitions of sauce in the same category of people being like I don't

00:56:59.03 want to talk politics it's going to get heated don't talk about sauce

00:57:02.09 definitions it's I I tweeted because I made a venn diagram because I went in

00:57:07.01 because uh I was trying I wanted to find

00:57:10.02 common ground within the episode it just we didn't it didn't work but

00:57:13.15 people are like I don't consider olive oil a sauce and I'm like well then what

00:57:18.13 is it like what would you consider what is olive oil

00:57:23.07 that's interesting like is an oil what is oil I think it's so clearly a

00:57:27.22 sauce is it a base uh well let me read everyday health.com

00:57:31.23 uh well it's gonna ah because I'm curious now too uh olive oil is a liquid fat

00:57:37.11 well you don't no one's like you want some fat on your salad

00:57:41.16 like what do you mean I'm just saying what the definition of

00:57:44.17 it is on Wikipedia it says olive oil is a liquid fat we should Andrew you should

00:57:50.08 try and make the highest calorie salad possible I'd why

00:57:54.11 why okay it's listed as a cooking oil okay culinary it's it's listed as a

00:57:59.22 staple cooking oil but you often arguing dipping sauce it's

00:58:05.05 also used extra virgin olive oil is mostly used as a salad dressing or an

00:58:09.22 ingredient in salad dressings so but it can be dipped in like a bit of uh oil

00:58:14.02 and vinegar with a bit of Italian bread yes I had that last night I had that
