00:00:00.00 Foreign.

00:00:09.11 [Music]

00:00:17.17 How old do you think Tito Ortiz is right now oh that's weird because he's a he's

00:00:23.02 a sports guy so like when you hit 32

00:00:26.02 you're viewed as ancient which like you have to apply a different I'm gonna.

00:00:31.13 Guess That Tito Ortiz is probably in his early 40s like 42. Is he still fighting

00:00:38.02 sort of he was the head of Oscar De La Hoya did an MMA event with him and Chuck.

00:00:44.00 Liddell that was a disaster I don't think he's fought since then and it

00:00:47.18 closed like it was such a bad event that it kind of bankrupted delhoya

00:00:52.01 um at least that's what he said so he's sort of fighting but not really

00:00:55.17 he used to be a politician he went in largely off of trump and then he got

00:01:00.00 thrown out after eight months for I think he was Huntington Beach I watched

00:01:04.03 a 3030 I believe it was on that fight you're talking about with him in Chuck.

00:01:09.04 Lidl and what a like what it was for them

00:01:12.17 um I looked it up he's 47 years old okay oh by the way uh well welcome to the

00:01:18.09 F**kFuckFacePodcast Geoff Gavin Andrew uh he's 47 years old so it's actually the same

00:01:23.08 age as me which was shocking but I was wondering how old do you think Tito

00:01:28.06 Ortiz would have to be you're how what you're your age right now which is what

00:01:33.10 26 or something 28 yeah so you're 28

00:01:35.23 years old a Tito Ortiz is 47. There is no world when you put there's no way in

00:01:39.11 which we put you and Tito in a Ortiz in a room together to fight that he doesn't

00:01:43.09 kill you pretty quickly oh it murders me

00:01:46.16 yeah within him but how old does he have to be before you've got a shot do you

00:01:51.12 think could you like could a year 28

00:01:53.21 could a 60 year old Tito Ortiz kick your

00:01:55.18 ass probably uh what could a 70 year old Tito Ortiz kick your ass I don't know I

00:02:01.10 don't think a six because you need to put T to work Tito Ortiz is an MMA

00:02:06.04 fighter so him at 60 is like 120. Like his body is so [ __ ] I think I could do

00:02:11.02 60 but that is the cut off how about is Arnold Schwarzenegger that's a great

00:02:15.05 question he's gonna be 70. I'd guess I'm

00:02:18.20 sure he could do okay piss out of Andrew still

00:02:21.12 I agree do you think yeah at what age do you think you could beat up Arnold

00:02:26.07 Schwarzenegger he's 72 now we all agree he would beat your ass he's 75 he's 75

00:02:32.05 75 oh Jesus I would say 85. I feel confident do you

00:02:36.00 think because your back is longer it has more chance of breaking um

00:02:41.20 that's an interesting question if I'm on the bottom I'm doing bottom control I

00:02:47.17 don't know that'd be tough what do you mean the box I'm saying like if he takes

00:02:53.01 me down right then if you're looking for like submissions yeah I'm thinking like

00:02:58.06 mixed martial arts like Jiu Jitsu I don't know if having a long back is a

00:03:01.23 disadvantage because I don't have long legs that definitely is what you want

00:03:05.23 you open up for triangles and sweeps and.

00:03:08.06 Nick's got a good point you'd have to uh

00:03:10.08 break his punches block the punches with your nose that's true that frees up my

00:03:14.12 hands you've got a secret weapon do you think his do you think his wrist and

00:03:18.04 fist will break before your nose does because maybe that's a tactic right

00:03:21.17 there I think you just I think you just unlocked this it's not at what age can I

00:03:26.05 beat up Arnold Schwarzenegger it's at what age will his body disintegrate

00:03:31.15 trying to fight me that's really not about me it's we're waiting for the

00:03:35.02 point in which he will just crumble at any movement that's what I need

00:03:40.08 disintegrate well if you uh audience member if you

00:03:44.04 have a access to Arnold Schwarzenegger or Tito Ortiz uh and are interested in

00:03:49.17 having either of them fight Andrew at some point in their geriatric days let

00:03:53.18 us know see if you can help facilitate this 85 year old Arnold Schwarzenegger

00:03:58.12 versus Andrew I would pay 100 bucks to see that I I

00:04:02.04 feel like the Schwarzenegger thing is so out of the realm of possibility but I

00:04:07.06 worry because the Tito Ortiz no it's very possible yeah it feels psychic

00:04:10.21 feels like for fifteen hundred dollars and just being in the same place he is

00:04:15.14 you could get Tito Ortiz to fight someone all right yeah but but not for

00:04:20.15 13 more years he's only 40. He's gotta hit 60. That's the can everybody.

00:04:24.15 Tito Ortiz nonsensical quote like this is a trash talk that he did this is this

00:04:28.21 is word for word what he said jealous of him this guy can't even put a [ __ ]

00:04:33.20 sentence together man you kidding me right now he's reaching for he's.

00:04:37.06 Reaching For Those Grapes he's trying to make his wine and the wine is already

00:04:42.11 singing Center like violin with that cheese and that wine we'll see you

00:04:47.08 November 24th what the [ __ ] does that mean what was the wine in that analogy I

00:04:52.00 don't know and you should hear him do it

00:04:54.04 because it's so much slower and like him

00:04:56.00 trying to Pro like it's just it's a mess he's a mess like but he it sounded like

00:04:59.12 he was trying to say that he couldn't make the wine but the wine was already

00:05:02.20 singing yeah I feel like he mixed so many metaphors at once and like he's

00:05:07.02 trying to do a violin thing it's just it's a disaster of a clip you know how

00:05:11.10 they refer to people as punch drunk and like if you get it it's essentially I

00:05:15.06 guess CTE right it's kind of we're talking about the Antonio Brown earlier

00:05:18.15 it's uh you just get hit enough times in your life that you're just loopy from

00:05:22.18 then on out yeah traumatic brain damage yeah but do you wonder if it's like oh

00:05:27.23 they just got hit in the head so many times they're slow or do you think a

00:05:31.16 person can only can get punched so many times that they're just always ready for

00:05:35.20 a punch and anytime they're taught like like maybe he's not mentally slow maybe

00:05:39.23 he just speaks slowly because he's just like always on guard he's just like he's

00:05:44.00 like for the rest of his life he's going

00:05:45.21 to be waiting for a punch to come at any moment in his life you know what I mean

00:05:50.02 do you think so or do you think it's the other way when if you know how to fight

00:05:53.20 you're not as worried about it like if somebody tries to make a move you have a

00:05:58.00 confidence that like I'll deal with them it's no problem I definitely I

00:06:01.14 definitely went into my fifth root canal a different man than I went into my

00:06:05.18 second I'll say that because you did experience yeah so it's like because I'd

00:06:09.09 had a thousand yeah so you do learn to take a punch well how many times Geoff

00:06:13.06 how many times have people punched you in the head or face in my life

00:06:17.23 because I didn't you get uh like a fist straight down on the top of your head

00:06:23.18 once what oh I got I oh when that the Fester

00:06:26.23 yeah I could never I always get mixed up between fester and porch I got hit on

00:06:33.02 the head by Fester I ran from well I ran from both of them I got hit on the head

00:06:39.14 by Fester because he caught me uh I did not get caught by porch

00:06:43.21 dude it's bad enough to get whopped on the head like a cartoon by a guy named.

00:06:48.11 Fester uh you do not want to hit get hit by a guy named porch a guy named porch

00:06:53.05 has the name porch for very specific reasons

00:06:57.02 yeah that's a great name you don't want to [ __ ] with porch porch is like a

00:07:01.19 background character in like Roadhouse is the vibe I get from porch yeah porch

00:07:07.16 is the he's the size of a literal porch yeah if my memory serves uh I I probably

00:07:12.22 been in I you know it's funny because you brought up two fights I would

00:07:16.02 completely forgotten about and I wouldn't have counted Gavin uh I've

00:07:20.01 probably been in 1012 fights in my life Maybe

00:07:24.07 maybe you got hit where I got hit yeah and with the early ones a lot worse than

00:07:30.01 the later ones uh uh oh all fights suck in the exact same

00:07:33.14 way to me okay uh I mean I never I never suffered catastrophic injuries I never

00:07:39.06 got like I got jumped in the Army once by uh 13 Marines I think I've told that

00:07:43.16 story maybe another podcast did you get like soap in the socked like what was

00:07:48.00 going on no I never got I never got that so what happened what So what had

00:07:51.22 happened to us what happened was uh I was at a place called the defense

00:07:55.04 information School in the Army it was in Fort Benjamin Harrison Indiana it's no

00:07:58.23 longer there it moved to uh for Maryland not that it matters but if you're from

00:08:03.07 Indiana and you're like I've never heard of Fort Ben Harrison and I live in

00:08:06.19 Indianapolis it's because it's gone but it used to be there and I was there uh

00:08:10.02 and so that's cool it was it was a joint school so it means

00:08:13.11 it was a it was a rarity in the military

00:08:15.14 they mean it means it was the journalism school right journalism and broadcast.

00:08:21.11 School uh so they taught all soldiers Marines Air Force Navy and Coast Guard

00:08:26.20 the same curriculum so they were mixed classes so I had classes with Marines

00:08:30.19 and Air Force and all those guys and girls uh and it was one of the only

00:08:35.08 schools in the Army like that and so we shared barracks and my like the Army

00:08:39.15 boys were on the first floor and then the Marines had the second floor and

00:08:43.23 then I want to say the Air Force had the the Marines and the Air Force alone and

00:08:47.17 then the Navy maybe had the third floor and then I think the Air Force had their

00:08:51.10 own accommodations because they were so [ __ ] fancy uh and then the fourth

00:08:54.14 floor was like the Army ladies and then maybe some other uh ladies from other uh

00:08:59.05 other branches too I think it might have just been like the ladies floor uh so

00:09:02.20 anyway one what would happen when you were called short time which is when

00:09:07.03 you're graduating and you're you're moving off uh to go start your duty

00:09:11.13 somewhere once you graduate your school uh assuming you didn't wash out like

00:09:15.19 most people uh you there were Traditions you would do like one of the Traditions

00:09:19.21 was the you would take buckets of water and you would run around to the other

00:09:23.16 people that were in the class before you and you would throw the water under

00:09:27.08 their door and like flood their bedroom so I was doing that one night because as

00:09:32.00 because I passed the goddamn journalism school and it was my right to do it

00:09:35.07 because I spent six [ __ ] months at that school and I absolutely deserved to

00:09:39.06 throw the water under the door like everybody else got to do with the

00:09:42.17 history of the defense information School uh but it's suddenly a big

00:09:47.08 [ __ ] deal when Geoff does it uh uh it was a big deal

00:09:50.10 because I went on the wrong floor I did it on the Marine floor and the problem

00:09:54.22 was the Marines who went to the journalism.

00:09:57.12 School weren't the only Marines there there were also Marines who did other

00:10:01.04 jobs I think these guys worked for like the Marine post office or something

00:10:06.13 honestly and uh don't [ __ ] with the Marine post officer uh and so they they

00:10:11.12 always a batch of dudes that had just been there for like a they had just

00:10:15.12 processed in so they had been there like four or five days they didn't know what

00:10:18.20 the [ __ ] was going on they didn't know the rules of the land so when some

00:10:25.04 140 pounds six foot tall scrawny Soldier

00:10:28.09 is running gleefully down their hallways screaming and laughing and giggling and

00:10:31.23 filling up a water bucket in a in a water fountain and then throwing it

00:10:36.07 under people's doors uh they didn't have a sense of humor for that and so about

00:10:39.22 it was 13 of them I remember uh grabbed me

00:10:43.01 they punched me around a little bit but what really hurt was they threw me down

00:10:47.05 a flight of stairs oh Jesus Christ yeah and then when I got to the when I hit

00:10:51.19 the ground I was going like backwards in slow motion and they were looking at me

00:10:55.06 and by the time I hit the ground they also went down the stairs to continue to

00:11:01.06 kick me and then eventually I remember thinking like well I'm

00:11:04.04 falling away from them.

00:11:06.03 I hit that and I was like oh why are their boots still here

00:11:10.23 but uh very very quickly after that uh somebody came and broke it up before I

00:11:16.03 got seriously hurt that's the closest I ever got to get like really damaged in a

00:11:19.08 fight I just I can't stop thinking about

00:11:22.22 how one like needing to call for help at defense information is like the worst

00:11:27.00 location there's no more embarrassing place to be than to need help oh my god

00:11:32.00 dude not only that but yeah that thing where you're doing something with your

00:11:35.11 friends and then you turn around and all your friends are gone like just

00:11:38.09 completely gone they're just like little clouds of smoke where they used to be

00:11:41.16 and Suddenly It's You versus the entire United States Marine Corps yeah well the.

00:11:46.22 United States Marine post office Corps it's a ferry

00:11:49.21 I could be misremembering that but I think I think that's what it was I think

00:11:52.22 they were going to like a postal training or something they were

00:11:56.10 definitely they definitely went postal on me God damn uh how about you gav

00:12:00.13 getting uh smacked in the head yeah how many times have you been hitting the

00:12:04.03 fight uh I mean no serious fights like we had like end fights where I got

00:12:08.15 punched yeah of course uh yeah but nothing that like rocked me yeah I think

00:12:13.06 my most of my head injuries have just been like standing up in a cupboard too

00:12:16.16 fast and stuff you never got you never got like just in a fight at lunch at

00:12:20.12 school with some other kid who was just like I don't know I'm just gonna try to

00:12:24.01 use some British sling but I don't have any is there some probably some some

00:12:29.12 dude who was it was a proper wanker now I got I got buttons some chav who

00:12:35.13 was giving you uh the bad stuff yeah like a big dog pile

00:12:38.23 but it but you know on to a scale where like the whole school comes oh yeah yeah

00:12:43.16 you try to throw a bucket away on the other door what did you do how did this

00:12:47.18 result in you being the sole Target uh well usually it was it started when like

00:12:51.19 people would be playing football at lunch and all the all the backpacks

00:12:55.23 would be in a big pile and sometimes you would just get chucked into the middle

00:12:59.13 and then the person who checked you shouts bundle everyone stops playing

00:13:03.17 football people come running out of buildings and swarming the field and

00:13:07.05 suddenly you're trying to get out of there before too many people had them

00:13:10.21 even sometimes you know you got like 17

00:13:13.01 people on top and you're just you're like and you're like trying to push

00:13:15.10 people out of the way and then you take a knee to the head and then you just

00:13:18.09 have to go fetal until it subside yeah add a few of those that's a great game

00:13:21.21 they were always fun though it was always it was always like really epic

00:13:25.23 and scary to see like 50 to 60 kids running towards you about to die

00:13:31.03 friend happened to my phone said he really like he it was it was pre the

00:13:37.18 cool hadn't been cool but he knew it was coming so he was just like leaping over

00:13:42.02 all the bags he'd somehow ended up in the middle but he got his ankle like

00:13:45.18 hooked on someone's strap and he was just really strong it was like he was in

00:13:49.13 quicksand of bags and then suddenly like people started coming in from the sides

00:13:53.14 it was like a zombie movie and he he was

00:13:55.16 somehow able to stay on top like someone would dive on him but he would like

00:13:59.01 angle himself and ended up just stepping on them so he was getting like higher

00:14:02.18 and higher as the bundle was growing but in the end he just succumbed and he was

00:14:06.22 like probably on top of five people but five people were on top it was and I was

00:14:12.03 just watching like I refused to bundle on my own friend

00:14:16.05 but uh I also didn't help him and I I watched it just looks so cool how

00:14:20.05 often did bundles occur like was this every day someone would get up oh no

00:14:25.19 this was probably maybe once a month would be a significant like you know

00:14:31.06 approaching a hundred people bundle I'm like oh Jesus

00:14:33.23 yeah and it was always just always all the blokes like girls

00:14:37.11 wouldn't get involved so you'd end up with just a little girls

00:14:40.17 just stood on their own while everyone was bustling do you think uh do you

00:14:44.20 think they still bundle to this day at that school I hope so like it wasn't a

00:14:48.22 tradition you started you inherited it right yeah yeah I think that's how most

00:14:53.23 school stuff goes you can also get grundened what's that it's just like the

00:14:58.19 uh it's like a dumpster on Wheels okay you just get loved in one of those oh

00:15:04.08 yeah another inherited tradition how about you Andrew I have you I assume

00:15:08.13 you've bit you've have you been kicked by as many kids as you've kicked in your

00:15:13.04 life yeah actually because it's zero the number is zero on both fronts so yeah

00:15:17.13 that's that's a factual factual statement Geoff I haven't kicked anybody

00:15:21.06 I don't think I've ever been kicked punched in the head yeah not really like

00:15:26.05 not no great stories relating to it definitely you have

00:15:30.14 this indestructible nose when it's just never been tested it's just you can you

00:15:34.20 can kind of sense it and here's the thing like my head is so big it's gonna

00:15:38.16 get hit if I was in a fight there's just no way around it it's it's an absolute

00:15:42.23 thing but I've avoided it for the most part I don't ever want to hear about you

00:15:48.09 getting hit by anyone for any reason yeah I don't it hasn't happened in a

00:15:52.12 long time good I had one I I wish I had like a fun School Story with Gavin or

00:15:56.12 like a good school fight it was like a kid punched me once and I said why and

00:16:01.19 then they walked away and that was it that was my big school brawl

00:16:05.14 this is why did you do that they had no response they're just like I'm angry and

00:16:09.22 then they left zero excitement I used to get I used to get popped from time to

00:16:14.18 time just from my mouth I used to have a real smart mouth when I was in high

00:16:18.01 school I had a real I had a real problem

00:16:20.02 with being sarcastic I thought that went away

00:16:24.01 so much better than it was what we did yesterday hold on before we

00:16:28.21 do though can we talk about this Antonio.

00:16:32.00 Brown tweet that Eric sent us well we're

00:16:34.11 kind of on the subject of getting hit uh and talking about sportsy stuff I'll

00:16:38.18 just read it Eric sent this to us right as we were starting the pleasantries

00:16:41.20 Gavin Antonio Brown if you don't know him he's uh he's a wide receiver uh in

00:16:46.01 NFL football he was a famous one he played for a lot of teams uh was

00:16:50.18 considered really really talented but also kind of like a loose cannon um

00:16:55.15 so here's the quote he wrote on his Twitter my biggest regret in my career

00:16:59.20 doesn't involve calling my GM a cracker or showing up to the Raiders Camp late

00:17:04.01 in a hot air balloon with frozen feet or

00:17:06.12 throwing rocks at that UPS driver and it definitely doesn't involve me taking my

00:17:10.14 shirt off and doing a Victory lap around

00:17:12.14 the Jets stadium mid game while throwing

00:17:14.11 up Deuces that's how he ended his career

00:17:16.15 in the NFL by the way that was last year

00:17:19.06 my biggest regret is that I'll never get

00:17:22.02 to see me Antonio Brown play a game live

00:17:24.20 sure I can watch the game afterwards but I can't imagine what that was like for

00:17:28.18 you all to see something like that like watching The Beatles or Jesus perform at.

00:17:32.06 Red Rocks Antonio Brown on his biggest regret

00:17:36.01 yeah he compared him see he compared to seeing him play football to watching

00:17:41.08 Jesus perform live at Red Rocks that's such a Kanye mindset it is yeah and

00:17:47.15 there's things he's I mean there are other scandals that he's part of that he

00:17:52.04 did not decide to mention um he's had quite the career over the

00:17:56.01 last few years there's only so many characters on Twitter that's true uh

00:18:00.16 so yeah we we should absolutely talk about what we did yesterday Gavin and uh

00:18:04.09 I'm actually glad to talk about it because I was I told you guys I would

00:18:08.07 have a uh a prototype of a of a fruit glove for this weekend and I and the

00:18:13.03 reason I don't is because of what we did yesterday can I just say somebody who

00:18:17.11 wasn't part of what happened but has seen images of it it is it looked like

00:18:21.23 it was an incredible time and I don't exactly know what was going on with

00:18:26.03 Gavin but it appeared to be like some form of torture device is how I describe

00:18:30.23 it like if somebody tried to make an ironing board a torture device is sort

00:18:35.03 of what I I was able to see but it looked like a lot of fun yeah I

00:18:38.23 definitely felt like I was on some sort of rack well technically you were I wish

00:18:43.09 we could release the images that Andrew's talking about on the on social.

00:18:47.10 But Eric says we should hold on to them because he doesn't want to give stuff

00:18:52.00 away yeah we should wait till to actually release the images what if we

00:18:55.17 blur 90 of it okay if you want to get Gavin Gavin if you want to blur night 90

00:19:01.06 percent of the image well I said we yeah we as you so yeah you go nuts no I

00:19:05.16 just watch him I want to know what the 10 would be what would you like them to

00:19:10.01 see and the 90 rule what's getting eliminated

00:19:13.23 there's an image that's so disturbing and so funny I had it sent I had Eric

00:19:19.07 send it to me last night and I was showing it to Emily and it's so funny

00:19:22.12 Gavin says that because the first thing she said she's like you gotta show that

00:19:25.13 to everybody I was like we can't Eric doesn't want to uh and she goes maybe

00:19:29.06 you could blur everything and just that be the point of the image is that Emily

00:19:33.06 said that yeah she said it last night to

00:19:35.20 me almost verbatim to what you said it's amazing yeah so uh you two are thinking

00:19:40.12 alike I don't know how I feel about that great ha ha ha I am in so much pain

00:19:47.21 really so what

00:19:51.17 Spence any longer so what he's referring to is yesterday we filmed episodes one

00:19:58.11 and two uh of the of the show that we've been talking about our video show that

00:20:02.19 we've been talking about for a while now

00:20:05.20 I pitched it about a year ago internally called does it do it's a it's a in

00:20:11.09 infomercial docu-series reality show where uh we go in and we we test the

00:20:16.16 efficacy of As Seen On TV products to determine if they are right for you or

00:20:20.05 not uh and we've been talking about doing it for like a year we've mentioned

00:20:22.08 it on this show a few times not too much uh because I don't know when we were

00:20:26.03 ever gonna make it but we made one and two yesterday and all we're doing might

00:20:30.04 add is we're just we're just testing we're just doing like a b testing for As.

00:20:34.21 Seen On TV products so why would you be sore I think I broke my hand and my ass

00:20:39.05 into in two different incidents dude I'll be honest man I didn't want to turn

00:20:45.15 around when I heard you hit the ground we were you know we were sprinting for a

00:20:51.16 thing for a test and Gavin a media really hit the ground

00:20:56.09 and it sounded it sounded like if you take a side of beef like you go into one

00:21:01.05 of those uh like meat trucks and you get like half a cow it's not like if you

00:21:04.15 held it about seven feet above the ground and just dropped it and let that

00:21:08.07 meat slap against the ground that's what it sounded like when you hit the ground

00:21:11.19 and it wasn't even like a good it wasn't like it looked good like I went through

00:21:16.08 a bunch of stuff and it looked too cinematic I just slipped onto my ass

00:21:20.07 so it's like all the pain but without anything that looked any good and it was

00:21:24.09 all because I was trying to push Geoff through the set

00:21:28.23 Gavin wiped out so many times while we were doing this and Geoff I don't think

00:21:34.11 watched him do it I watched it every time and grimaced like oh we're gonna

00:21:39.16 have to like take Gavin to the hospital there was one where he fell and just

00:21:44.13 laid there holding his wrist and I went there's no way his wrist is not broken

00:21:50.13 it was bad it was [ __ ] bad I got out of the the Uber after I got home and I

00:21:56.05 was just like oh I just feel like I've been beaten up it was like a post bundle

00:21:59.08 feeling [Laughter]

00:22:02.14 I'm just feeling my age I think like slipping onto my ass I've probably done

00:22:07.15 maybe 50 times in my life but now it's like it's really registering to the

00:22:12.22 point where I'm like getting up and sitting down with groans because it

00:22:18.07 hurts yeah your body becomes a grown tube when you hit a button foreign

00:22:25.11 tubed every time I've stood up or sat down uh for the first time of the day

00:22:30.22 for like the last seven years of my life probably [Laughter]

00:22:35.09 now I'm just picturing the grape lady it's like a palette of spilling cheese

00:22:42.04 oh man great lady came up the other day at home for some reason even though

00:22:46.12 everybody has seen it to her a million times and Italy and I still sat down and

00:22:50.12 re-watched the grape lady probably 20

00:22:52.08 times in a row it never stops being funny

00:22:55.21 she's the gift that keeps on giving man there's a sound that comes from people

00:23:01.16 that's it's so it's from so deep within when they're really hurt like you watch

00:23:05.20 someone like fall off a roof and get winded it's not like a scream it's just

00:23:09.19 like it's just so you can't replicate it yeah

00:23:14.01 so good yes it's like the grape lady The.

00:23:18.10 Grapes pierced her to her core like that

00:23:21.06 is the deepest pain that we've heard and it was because of grapes it is intense

00:23:26.14 deep guttural pain yeah the wine was singing like oh my God it's like if you

00:23:33.13 needed a sound effect for death that's what it it's like it's just the most

00:23:39.04 pain and not wanting to exist it's terrible that's hilarious

00:23:44.16 oh but I think it went really well uh I don't know how Gavin and Eric feel but

00:23:49.13 um it was it was a little hard because I I was telling this uh to some other

00:23:53.01 people yesterday I I initially wrote down the pitch for the show and

00:23:56.05 developed the one sheet for it like over a year ago and I haven't thought about

00:23:59.23 it much since then in terms of like sitting down and actually making the

00:24:02.20 show because I already came up with the idea a year ago it's in my head

00:24:06.05 somewhere right and so yesterday when we sat down to finally make it I was like

00:24:09.12 [ __ ] how long has it been since I looked at this information I think what you

00:24:13.19 said I don't really remember what this is yeah I had to sit down and

00:24:17.17 re-familiarize myself luckily Eric had to run a show which helped a lot

00:24:22.11 um uh he did some awesome producing but uh yeah I think we're gonna film an

00:24:26.04 eight episode season and we think two but we can't film anymore for like a

00:24:31.03 month because Gavin's got schedule problems so Eric when do you think it'll

00:24:36.20 come out uh I think that the first episode of PR honestly if I can get

00:24:41.10 an editor on this which is with our bandwidth tough uh I think we could get

00:24:46.15 something out ah man this episode comes out on like the 24th I bet I could get

00:24:51.15 something out next week like wow in terms of like by the end of August I'd

00:24:56.05 like to have one episode out and I know that might drag because it's one episode

00:25:00.02 then a second episode probably like the following week and then who knows when

00:25:04.04 we can do the rest but I'd rather have something out and have people yeah watch

00:25:09.20 and give us some feedback to see if they enjoy it and then really

00:25:14.04 like let's film like 10 in a day yeah we could just do like they are so fun they

00:25:20.05 were so fun to do I would love to do like 10 in a day you're gonna kill

00:25:24.23 gavica yeah I haven't tried for the record I didn't

00:25:29.11 try to hurt Gavin at all 100 no and this is

00:25:32.20 absolutely on Gavin it was all me every single injury I took and I didn't even

00:25:38.18 expect to do any sort of stunt the entire day it just kept happening I mean

00:25:43.14 it was even every single thing that happened to it was my fault well you

00:25:46.16 said you were trying to shove Geoff through the set so like yeah definitely

00:25:50.13 it's undeniably honest I decided we should do a race at one point

00:25:55.12 oh it was Gavin saying we should do a race and then Geoff just keeps going what

00:26:01.06 what do you mean how do we race what do you mean and then Gavin just going go

00:26:07.21 ready go go ready go it was great yeah I don't want to Hype it up it wasn't like

00:26:12.23 a it was it was very goofy yeah this isn't gonna be like this isn't like this

00:26:18.05 isn't some big rooster teeth first production that we spent tons of money

00:26:23.10 on and it's gonna be like a 30 minute episode I think the episodes are

00:26:27.13 probably eight or nine minutes yeah maybe remember think face it's very dumb

00:26:33.02 but but I will say this the set that I had in my head Eric captured perfectly

00:26:39.05 and that was I mean it was like a one for one perfect set I was so happy with

00:26:44.12 like the color palette and our design team Michelle Sontag in design with that

00:26:49.13 does it do logo like oh it's perfect oh it's it nailed it like just it's a it's

00:26:55.14 a shame you messed up the costume I didn't mess up the costume hey

00:27:00.09 hey Gavin I got the right size for you you fit perfectly in that shirt

00:27:06.14 well it wasn't what I asked for you said extra media that's large that's why you

00:27:12.09 asked for it doesn't exist [ __ ] I'm gonna defend Eric here if somebody tells

00:27:17.08 you what their shirt size is extra medium what are you gonna buy them large

00:27:22.06 no that's not how extra Works no no because with small extra small is

00:27:28.08 smaller than small with large what's extra large extra large is larger than

00:27:34.06 large extra medium large one only one only one that's extra

00:27:42.01 being small it there's one the rest are bigger no extra medium could not be more

00:27:47.15 medium it's like absolutely straight in the middle medium that's me

00:27:52.22 um you're describing medium I'm actually

00:27:56.05 I asked what I asked for I actually went before Gavin got there Eric had the

00:28:01.03 costumes laid out and I went over to see which one was mine and they were both

00:28:05.08 the exact same waist and the exact same shirt size I looked at Eric and I was

00:28:09.06 like Gavin's not gonna be happy if he finds out he and I are the same size now

00:28:14.01 he's supposed to be going rough I wrote extra Medium as a small slack

00:28:19.02 joke and you took that to mean Lodge and I just don't think that's what extra

00:28:24.17 media means well I I just I don't know how you defend that [ __ ] this yeah I

00:28:30.08 really don't I'm with you Eric [ __ ] this oh but I'm with Eric too

00:28:38.19 much to be an [ __ ] I just thought you know I just still end up with the media

00:28:44.16 I can see your confusion

00:28:52.12 how can you agree with me and still argue.

00:28:58.21 I mean it's not what I would have bought

00:29:02.00 but I can see why you did what the [ __ ]

00:29:04.14 what the [ __ ]

00:29:06.14 [Applause]

00:29:09.10 Now word from our sponsor better help taking care of yourself and finding ways

00:29:14.10 to support your mental health is so important I personally recently took a

00:29:18.05 little break to recharge and it has really helped me feel more refreshed

00:29:21.23 other things I do sometimes to help with my mental health is listen to music or

00:29:26.02 have relaxing bath but there's also better help online therapy I've had to

00:29:31.02 sort through all kinds of issues through therapy and it has been incredibly

00:29:34.04 helpful to me it has helped me within that moment as well as giving me tools

00:29:38.11 to help process certain issues when they arise so I personally would always

00:29:42.07 highly recommend trying therapy better help offers a variety of ways to

00:29:46.10 communicate on their platform whether it

00:29:48.10 be video audio only or even live chat so you're comfortable in whatever

00:32:33.23 useful is it the end of the Redemption year no I think that happened already

00:32:39.10 this is uh the final day that I'm uh of my uh my my bike ride Banning because of

00:32:45.11 the vasectomy tomorrow as of tomorrow I can ride my bike again that's exciting

00:32:49.15 and how's your scrot rot the jock itch is under control yeah I mean it's still

00:32:54.10 there it's still discolored but they you know they say that that's normal and

00:32:58.02 it'll still be there for up to eight weeks but uh I'm taking the pills I'm

00:33:02.21 like a week into like uh two weeks of antibiotics or whatever and they gave me

00:33:06.17 a much bigger tube of cream and then I'm in no pain but I'm still daily applying

00:33:12.13 jock itch cream and taking a jock itch pill every day so I'm still I'm still

00:33:16.13 wow I'm still just focused on Dick Health uh dick Area Health every day of

00:33:21.07 my life as I have been for what seems like six weeks straight yeah so this

00:33:25.13 will be yeah more than six weeks right now I can't and you've never had this

00:33:29.15 issue before and now it's just it's part

00:33:32.08 of your life this is and it's like it it just it perfectly framed my vasectomy I

00:33:37.03 got it two weeks before it went away for the vasectomy as soon as the vasectomy

00:33:41.01 started to wean off the vasectomy it came back yeah it's one of those things

00:33:45.13 where once you get it you're more prone to getting it again later or is it so I

00:33:50.02 think it just had a terrible run I think I just had a bad run I think it didn't

00:33:53.06 totally go away you know and I remember like the the dude when the pharmacist I

00:33:56.20 think I said this last time the pharmacist did tell me when I got my

00:33:59.18 pills and stuff he was like you might need more than this these things are

00:34:04.00 persistent I was like shut up dude uh so I'll be apologizing to him if I see him

00:34:07.19 again so is it just mainly around the front like it didn't work its way behind

00:34:11.23 you didn't get like like in that in the athlete anus uh no no it's just it's

00:34:17.16 just like on my thigh my right thigh and then up a little bit um

00:34:22.21 kind of like where the waistband is would go around your pants kind of like

00:34:28.20 uh in two spots like yeah so just in like sweat locked areas I

00:34:33.19 guess so yeah I'm actually I'm just actually wondering because I had been uh

00:34:38.17 uh not wearing the my my bog standard swim trunks this year you know the ones

00:34:42.22 that I had like eight pairs of that I was just only wearing I decided to mix

00:34:45.20 it up a little bit this year so I've been wearing a bunch of different shorts

00:34:49.02 and I'm wondering if maybe I just am disagreeing with a fabric but uh I mean

00:34:52.09 clearly it's the jock itch so it's probably not it yeah well at least it's

00:34:56.19 not spreading and it sounds like there's

00:35:00.07 any more yeah you've hit it hit a cap of it I think I'm on the back nine

00:35:05.08 I did some homework oh [ __ ] what'd you do uh I watched hands on a hard body oh

00:35:11.01 oh that's great and when I got to the credits I noticed a very special name in

00:35:17.05 there Arnold vosloo Matthew McConaughey Arnold freaking fossil I told you what

00:35:24.06 does he have to do with that I have no idea my brain still rejects that that's

00:35:29.07 not Billy Zane I really have an issue with that every time every time I see

00:35:32.20 him as the mummy my brain just goes I think that's Billy Zane I didn't hate

00:35:37.04 hey Andrew until right now I thought that was Billy Zane yeah you thought

00:35:41.08 Billy Zane was immotep absolutely yeah we're talking about this on the show I

00:35:45.12 had that Discovery like a year ago thinking that emotep is Billy's ain't I

00:35:50.08 didn't know that I mean I guess they got the same they same face and head

00:35:57.15 I think Anna vasel is from South Africa or something I I didn't even know his

00:36:02.17 name that will always just be Billy Zane to me

00:36:06.06 that's crazy I wonder what he would like a different Arnold vosloo but

00:36:12.16 that's a hell of a name that is quite the coincidence

00:36:16.11 how many yeah how many Donald vars lose in film are there Arnold wazley

00:36:23.11 I don't know yeah I'm looking at IMDb and he's that's

00:36:28.19 Arnold vosloo that's listed there as a special thanks okay

00:36:33.00 you're seeing that those two dudes look alike yes you're telling me yeah

00:36:38.00 those two those two those two I don't know how many twins look alike

00:36:47.15 yeah I don't know how you can't I don't know what you don't see they look the

00:36:52.11 exact same no I get it and those two they definitely look alike I never made

00:36:55.16 the connection until this moment but you're right they look I always think of

00:36:58.22 Billy Zane with hair I think that's the thing I think of Billy Zane like in Twin.

00:37:02.21 Peaks see I think I've just missed hair Billy

00:37:06.02 Zane I don't think I've seen a lot of Zayn movies I haven't seen Titanic I

00:37:10.05 didn't see Twin Peaks my only point of reference for Billy Zane is not a Billy

00:37:15.01 Zane movie yeah me too Geoff you know what it is it's it's a Billy Corgan

00:37:20.23 like hair no hair Smashing Pumpkins thing ah Billy Corgan I don't think a

00:37:25.08 lot of people have seen Billy Corgan with hair and I think that's what we're

00:37:28.22 dealing with here I think you're right I think you're right so you thought.

00:37:33.00 Imhotep was running around the Titanic well I didn't know yeah I guess yeah

00:37:36.01 when I heard Billy Zane was in the Titanic and my brain would went oh wow

00:37:39.14 he's in that too yeah because I've never seen the Titanic

00:37:43.15 so it's not like I watched and was like ammo tep is doing [ __ ] but just the

00:37:48.02 knowledge I always thought Billy Zane was a bit elvisy like I always thought

00:37:51.12 like he could have done like Elvis in a biopic I could see that in the the photo

00:37:55.12 that Gabby was consuming that's Titanic or is that what is that that's Twin.

00:37:59.00 Peaks Twin Peaks okay no yeah I could see it I could see some Elvis there what

00:38:02.15 did you think of hands on a hard body Gavin Oh I thought it was great and that

00:38:05.21 guy you would describe it was phenomenal the air conditioner guy oh it's one of

00:38:10.02 my favorite scenes from any movie ever it's a great monologue the genuine it's

00:38:14.14 like an office moment the way he pivots to genuine fear about talking about his

00:38:19.19 house going 15 below zero that's all right

00:38:22.21 it just builds so nicely I mean not to spoil anything but like the reasons why

00:38:27.13 certain people get eliminated is so perfect for their character that like

00:38:31.09 you couldn't script it better I'll be honest though for a documentary about a

00:38:35.05 subject they sure [ __ ] didn't film a lot of stuff that happened no it's mainly

00:38:39.06 character interviews I want to say right I haven't seen it in a long time but

00:38:42.06 it's a lot of like them away from the truck talking I wonder how they even

00:38:45.12 would have shot that because they didn't

00:38:47.17 have much time beyond the truck I wonder if all those interviews are post

00:38:49.05 competition

00:38:53.23 how they would have captured those moments I think they were grabbing stuff

00:38:58.21 as it went on like in the breaks a lot that'd be wild to like 10 of your 15

00:39:03.17 minutes spent talking about the things that are currently happening it's such a

00:39:07.20 weird did you also watch American movie or just hands on a hard body I've still

00:39:11.17 got to watch American movie I think you'll like American movie even better

00:39:15.14 hands on a hard bodies pretty [ __ ]

00:39:17.21 great movie they're both great I just it's you get more of a deep dive into

00:39:22.12 the characters in uh American movie you get like you get more time with them

00:39:27.10 I'll say and you get more invested in their lives which I think helps and

00:39:32.11 usually credits though that's a great that's a cool credits for

00:39:37.00 or an American movie hopefully Arnold Bosley or at least Billy Zane yeah

00:39:43.09 well that didn't help at all.

00:39:48.16 I like credits for an American movie that didn't work Google

00:39:56.04 didn't think that was specific enough never mind lots of uh lots of feedback

00:40:01.05 about our serial discussion from the comments

00:40:05.04 lots of uh we really opened up some cultural doors there and apparently

00:40:10.18 bicycles are just like it's like what a Frosted Flake is to a cornflake oh

00:40:15.13 really like a sugared frosted uh Rice Krispie but a lot of people saying

00:40:19.13 they've never seen him so I think maybe they're done

00:40:21.19 and that sounds good though like adding more sugar to Rice Krispies

00:40:26.05 I don't see why that would be a bad thing no that would be great I'm gonna

00:40:31.01 sell some on eBay or something get an old box

00:40:35.05 like how inspired would you eat cereal oh pretty expired yeah pretty expired it

00:40:40.13 also depends on the cereal like what ingredients are are in it or

00:40:44.23 on it largely on it I wouldn't want to do something that was

00:40:49.16 like marshmallow Centric like Lucky Charms that'd be tough but Amazon does

00:40:55.11 not have bicycles cereal I tried Cinnamon Toast Crunch for the

00:40:59.07 first time in my life like five days ago four days ago I cannot believe that

00:41:05.02 that's a cereal it is great it's delicious but it's just sugar it's just

00:41:09.21 cinnamon sugar in a bag with texture I couldn't believe how sugary it was you

00:41:14.06 know what's weird I [ __ I love cinnamon and I love sugar and I love

00:41:18.07 cereal but I don't like cinnamon toast crunch I know I'm in an extreme minority

00:41:23.02 but I just something about it doesn't doesn't go together for me it's so

00:41:27.22 interesting because to me it just tastes like a cinnamon treat you would get I

00:41:32.17 know there's no difference to me so that's fascinating I wonder what it is

00:41:36.05 just don't associate cinnamon with breakfast maybe I don't know that's

00:41:39.21 totally fair because it was jarring to eat it I could not imagine having this

00:41:45.04 as like a breakfast start to my day it's a dessert it's a great dessert

00:41:49.21 the uh the audience uh also seems very keen on the idea of us doing some sort

00:41:55.03 of a supplemental cereal tasting thing uh so I guess we should probably do that

00:41:59.05 at some point maybe maybe we can do that

00:42:01.23 during maybe we could all have cereal to kick off our office day

00:42:06.12 oh damn Andrew can't get involved yes cereal from [ __ ] Canada but

00:42:10.02 that's what I'm just gonna eat my own cereal isn't the whole point that you're

00:42:13.02 gonna have cereals that you haven't had before well yeah we'll just mail them to

00:42:17.09 each other and stuff okay well that's that's a different conversation I'm on

00:42:20.23 board I'm just saying I think we need to follow through it's I think this is one

00:42:24.07 of those things we shouldn't let Daniel no I agree but we also have the chips

00:42:28.00 I'm excited about the chip off let's get the chip off going then we can do the

00:42:31.03 cereal yeah stuff's really backing up that's

00:42:34.19 good because he won't leave Canada for Christ's sake that's true I said I

00:42:39.22 wanted to leave it's very clear wait I thought so true November Vegas in

00:42:44.14 November we're not going to Vegas in November oh but I said that's what I'd go

00:42:49.22 have you ever said there publicly all right like do we announce that I think

00:42:54.15 we kind of for some reason we're not doing that now yeah yeah I think we

00:42:58.10 talked about it didn't we I think so well either way we're not going to Vegas

00:43:02.23 in November yeah I'm pretty sure we did Nick's right we did did we oh I don't

00:43:06.19 think we did okay then we're announcing it here we're not going to Vegas in

00:43:10.20 November well that doesn't look like it yeah

00:43:18.01 the Vegas in November just [ __ ]

00:43:20.09 that's not what we're talking about we're talking about the show yeah oh

00:43:25.20 yeah well it's probably not gonna go oh probably why do you keep putting things

00:43:30.17 on it qualifiers or whatever who can say anything definitively anymore in 2022.

00:43:35.20 Everyone else got to do their live show and we've done to us well yeah we were

00:43:40.03 good yeah it's because we were gonna do ours in June and you guys went oh I

00:43:44.20 don't want to do that I don't I don't want to do that so we pushed it back I

00:43:48.17 don't think now we're not doing it listen I will take ownership of the fact

00:43:53.03 that I wanted November that I pushed for

00:43:55.01 November this is not my fault this is an insane to imply that this is in any way

00:43:59.22 my fault if I have done June we would have done

00:44:03.06 it it would have happened I will say this it would have happened in June

00:44:07.23 yeah you Son of God I'm really I don't really know how you're absolved like you

00:44:12.12 changed the date I don't know are you kidding me are you kidding me you're

00:44:17.14 gonna blame me for this I thought we were pretty clear yeah

00:44:20.21 that's outrageous I'm not gonna get into why that's an outrageous statement

00:44:24.12 that'd be unfair to me but I don't think I'm the one that dropped the ball I'll

00:44:29.19 just say that I'm not the one I'm not I'm not getting

00:44:33.15 into what's happening but it's you can't blame me he said Eric dropped the pool

00:44:37.11 I'm not saying Eric drop the ball at all I'm just saying that Paul may have to

00:44:40.14 have dropped and it wasn't me somewhere a ball is on the floor I just don't know

00:44:44.05 whose legs it said you know who wouldn't have dropped that ball Antonio Brown

00:44:48.13 no worries that ball we would be in Vegas in November hey maybe we should

00:44:53.04 instead of whining about all this stuff we're not doing let's focus on what we

00:44:57.23 are doing we're gonna watch mvp2

00:44:59.18 tomorrow morning

00:45:02.07 yeah it's really it's a monkey movie morning on Friday that is really

00:45:06.23 happening Andrew if you've been working on your previously on uh I wrote so the

00:45:12.01 problem is we were gonna do this like five months ago so I re-watched oh I'm

00:45:17.02 sorry yeah the date changed you can't really blame me for that one so

00:45:20.21 what that is you know I guess I don't want to talk about who dropped the ball

00:45:25.23 okay I don't know what that was about I'm just saying that balls people were

00:45:31.11 busy we had to move it so I took all these notes and uh so I have to go back

00:45:35.09 and find my notes on the the point by points on the movie okay do you think it

00:45:39.04 makes sense for me to record it independently or I feel like it would

00:45:42.09 make more sense to just open with that so people don't have to look for us

00:45:46.18 what's the format are you explaining it do we get a nice slides how like what

00:45:51.22 happened I didn't even consider slides how no I was just gonna explain it

00:45:56.06 ideally it should be a PowerPoint.

00:45:58.17 I don't know or Google Sheets if you don't if you don't have MS Office Google.

00:46:03.22 Sheets is fun that's true I'll take a sheet you want a PowerPoint

00:46:08.18 okay yeah and by that I mean I will post photos into the Discord while I talk

00:46:13.02 about it I'm willing to do that that's PowerPoint that's great but then we miss

00:46:16.14 out on the Transitions and stuff oh [ __ ]

00:46:19.13 okay I'm gonna well I guess I'll be screen grabbing tonight from [ __ ] MVP

00:46:23.12 if you're gonna do transitions can you do star wipes I like those well I'm not

00:46:29.03 gonna watch banana wipes banana wipes what would a

00:46:32.21 banana wipe look like it's not a problem shape of a banana

00:46:37.23 ah well first of all I realized that I dropped the gun on this what is what are

00:46:42.14 the wipes what are we even talk is that like a transitional effect what are we

00:46:47.10 discussing I like how much of a yes man you are

00:46:50.03 you're like absolutely we'll get this types in there yeah what's a star way

00:46:59.11 can I tell you what I think a star wipe is where my brain immediately went like

00:47:05.05 a scene transition with stars going from left to right into the next thing that

00:47:10.14 is what I imagined yeah mostly or like I mean there's there's yeah yeah that

00:47:15.04 works okay oh I think I think Gavin may have submitted a gift yeah there you go

00:47:20.15 there's a gif of a Star Wars that's a it's a bit of a fancy one I wouldn't be

00:47:24.17 asking for that level but yeah usually oh those okay yeah I noticed star wipe

00:47:29.00 is then yeah so what I think a banana would be like a [ __ ] yeah it would be

00:47:33.13 like a banana peel into the next scene yeah yeah okay

00:47:37.19 well none of that's happening but I'll do my best to try to guess

00:47:43.03 you've got a whole 24 hours well you got a whole at least 18 hours to work on

00:47:47.11 this I'd it would be shocking Gavin I just

00:47:50.10 learned that what F5 does you think I'm gonna [ __ ] do banana wipes

00:47:56.04 oh it's on my keyboard I'm gonna Google banana wipe and see what comes up banana

00:48:02.09 wipe I'm so excited I got Eric asked a question about mvp2 and I didn't realize

00:48:07.12 it was in our face slack I thought Eric just messaged me that and so I gave it a

00:48:11.21 description and then I regretted it because like oh these are spoilers these

00:48:15.20 are key spoilers for the movie that we're gonna see tomorrow so all that

00:48:21.13 [ __ ] was a that was a I found this that is a banana wipe it's a doormat

00:48:25.20 it's a doormat banana banana peel that says Don't Tread On Me

00:48:29.11 that's pretty funny Andrew have you started uh shopping from the end caps

00:48:33.06 you want to talk about that oh maybe that could be next episode

00:48:37.16 yeah it's a little bit to go into maybe next episode

00:48:41.10 yeah I can't wait to see how you didn't do it

00:48:43.12 just a little bit to get into don't get ahead of yourself it's a little bit to

00:48:47.01 get into you got 18 hours before tomorrow morning to go shopping at end

00:48:50.18 caps no it's uh it's a whole thing uh I will say I had a great disappointment

00:48:54.14 last night I'm sitting on a broken chair I broke my it finally happened did not

00:48:59.20 happen during a recording that's very sad my chair has been on the verge of

00:49:05.10 breaking for like four months I uh I fell over in it [Laughter]

00:49:10.16 back in like February when I was having like the really bad foot issues I was

00:49:16.02 rolling out of my chair onto my bed so I could just I avoid having to put any

00:49:20.06 pressure on my foot and I did it one time but I forgot to raise the armrest

00:49:25.06 so I just took the whole chair down with me and it has been in a bad spot since

00:49:30.09 that point and pop a wheel off or something uh no it's like the my my seat

00:49:34.16 part has turned into an analog stick for the range of movement it allowed so I

00:49:40.06 was like this is definitely gonna break and I hope it's during the show it was

00:49:44.06 not I dropped my phone I went to pick it up while staying on the chair and it

00:49:50.04 just cracked forward so now my chair is constantly at a forward tilt unless I

00:49:55.15 push back on it and whenever I get out of my chair it goes to the highest hype

00:49:59.06 setting it can go it's a great issue I would like to walk your room with a

00:50:03.12 clipboard like a a house inspector to see just write down everything that

00:50:08.08 needs to be replaced there's been there have been some things

00:50:12.09 there have been some issues for sure I had to clean

00:50:16.16 um somebody came through recently to check all the smoke alarms and while I

00:50:21.17 was cleaning things I noticed in the corner of the ceiling was still

00:50:25.03 partially Blue from a time I dropped the Slurpee and just flung it everywhere in

00:50:30.12 my room from like five months ago so I had to get rid of that I remember that

00:50:34.19 yeah I went on a real run of dropping drinks to the point now where it is I've

00:50:39.00 never been more scared than when I have to hold two drinks in my hands if I've

00:50:44.15 wanted each hand there is a genuine deep fear rooted in past trauma I throw them

00:50:49.15 they just launch out of my hand I need one hand to brace for impact because I'm

00:50:53.14 almost certainly gonna fall or drop or trip or do something if I have the

00:50:58.09 largest size drinks I could possibly have in my hands

00:51:01.22 I'm gonna be I feel like all the times we've hung out in real life in the past

00:51:05.13 I've never been worried for your safety but now I'm just gonna be like I can't

00:51:10.01 believe you never fell in front of us well I guess you fell yeah yeah

00:51:15.13 I can't believe I never saw you roll an ankle on a curb or anything oh

00:51:20.14 technically Geoff has seen that too but it was in the dark and I don't think he

00:51:24.10 noticed um I'm trying to think if I ever just

00:51:28.07 straight up well no there's a time where I was in a room

00:51:32.06 see I don't you're not very observant necessarily Gavin where I was visiting

00:51:36.14 the office and I was in a room and you know what I was looking out for you

00:51:41.11 walked in like that hey like said to the people in

00:51:44.23 the room walked through went to a different room was there for a little

00:51:48.19 bit walked back out I was just looking at you the entire time waiting for you

00:51:52.21 to like see me and then I was gonna be like hey and you just didn't you just

00:51:56.18 left you had no idea that I was in that room oh you know what it feels like huh

00:52:01.19 yeah I do yeah I can relate to that chef

00:52:06.03 I'm probably just like I'm gonna do that Zero thanks what are you gonna do about

00:52:10.04 this new uh double drink carrying phobia that you have because it sounds to me

00:52:14.10 like we need to do some sort of a drink carrying immersioned obstacle course

00:52:20.04 therapy where we can uh like recreate your room outside and then run you

00:52:24.20 through drills oh holding two drinks yeah I don't

00:52:27.12 strengthen your ability and your confidence so that you don't have to

00:52:30.14 worry about this that's what I do need you're right I need to gain my drink

00:52:35.13 confidence back yeah you need carry confidence

00:52:39.04 what's your ankle integrity at right now

00:52:43.05 like percentage-wise that's good I'd say my ankles are 100

00:52:47.05 that sounds like Marathon huh Marathon talk

00:52:49.18 yeah you know for sure yeah you know those exist we'll do this we'll get

00:52:53.21 around to it when else are you gonna be a hundred percent that's the thing I

00:52:59.07 don't want to immediately go back to 0.5

00:53:02.02 on both so there's I'm kind of enjoying this stretch of a hundred before I put

00:53:07.13 myself back through the ringer huh I I think that's no way to live life yeah

00:53:12.20 in what way are you potentially gonna miss out on

00:53:16.11 experiencing a marathon because if fear you like Kevin you like to live

00:53:21.10 your life .5 ankles at a time like what are you saying I'm trying to if anything

00:53:27.14 I'm arguing I want to be able to enjoy things

00:53:31.16 by having functioning ankles you clearly

00:53:33.23 want to do a marathon you're never going to be able to do it at less than 100

00:53:37.16 percent so what do you need to start the

00:53:41.06 marathon I need some more time at 100 is

00:53:43.11 what I need that's fair you just need to drink it in yeah yeah I just need to

00:53:48.22 enjoy it a little bit before I crash the plane again

00:53:51.08 there needs to be time there's reasons why I didn't do the burger challenge

00:53:57.06 back to back to back I need time these things take take a toll

00:54:01.03 oh they're tough but I'm excited one day it will happen hopefully soon hopefully

00:54:05.14 like in a month if I get a month of good ankle time no issues I'm in this month

00:54:10.20 is enough do you guys ever watch that show Hard.

00:54:15.02 Knocks absolutely yeah this season is a governor you've probably not seen us a.

00:54:21.01 HBO show and each each season they follow one of the worst performing NFL

00:54:25.10 teams from the previous Seasons spring training so like players trying to make

00:54:30.06 the team getting cut Rookie's coming in trying to make a name for themselves and

00:54:33.19 it's just like a docu-series that's just like six episodes and it's just it's

00:54:38.09 literally just like the team trying to build themselves up and get ready for

00:54:42.00 the season and this year it's the Detroit Lions because they only won

00:54:45.06 three games last year and uh the first episode is it was the only one

00:54:49.01 that's out but the first episode literally has the coach sitting in front

00:54:52.19 of all the guys uh sitting in uh an air-conditioned uh theater and he's

00:54:56.23 given them this pep talk and he goes pay attention to how you feel right now

00:55:02.18 how you feel right now soak it up and enjoy it this is the best you're gonna

00:55:08.11 feel till next march you're going to get progressively sore and more injured and

00:55:13.16 in shittier of every day from today for the next like 10 months so just accept

00:55:19.01 it and acknowledge it and move on but but soak up today and enjoy today

00:55:23.05 because today is the last day you're gonna feel like this that's all it was

00:55:26.07 running through my head the whole time Andrew was talking about being 100 it's

00:55:30.01 funny because that just needs more time he needs more time to soak it in yeah I

00:55:33.21 do I need to soak it in a little bit more I like a month was it was the

00:55:37.21 amount though like that's not very long how long would you give I was trying to

00:55:43.15 find if I was someone with the ankle problems that you had and you wanted to

00:55:47.02 really enjoy the 100 ankles I probably I probably won a year

00:55:51.13 a year okay but here's the thing if I say a year I'm gonna get killed for that

00:55:56.07 I feel like yeah there's no way that that's gonna fly you

00:56:00.06 are setting him up for failure feels like they did after a month just a month

00:56:05.22 he's like all right time to get out there and risk both

00:56:09.09 ankles again yeah I think a month is fair I will say a month can be a long

00:56:13.16 time like I haven't talked about this but uh Emily uh Emily went out of town

00:56:18.05 to go visit her family and Millie went to go stay with her mom and I had eight

00:56:22.22 days just recently completely and totally alone uh it was just me and the dog I

00:56:28.02 didn't see anybody I didn't talk I I I did go to the movies with Jack uh on a

00:56:32.23 Saturday uh but for like eight days pretty much straight I didn't see or

00:56:36.22 talk to anybody or interact with human beings at all and that was only a week

00:56:42.19 and that was at least a month of my life

00:56:45.23 that it took uh so a month can be a very

00:56:48.06 a month could feel like a year if you're alone in my house with just a bulldog

00:56:52.13 and nobody you easily could have reached out for a lovely bike ride or well I

00:56:56.17 came here yeah he's on break no it's a good it's a great Point yeah I am I'm

00:57:01.08 not complaining I'm not complaining I'm not complaining about it I needed the

00:57:04.09 time to decompress uh I had just spent a a pretty hellacious couple weeks uh

00:57:08.22 dealing with Millie had her big jaw surgery and so we were you know that was

00:57:12.09 like the culmination of like years and years of like preparation and stuff so I

00:57:17.17 was kind of like needed a week to kind of just like come down but uh but yeah I

00:57:23.00 guess I could have reached out I was here I didn't I'll tell you I'll be honest

00:57:27.17 with you for some reason I thought you weren't I was like yeah gab won't be

00:57:30.16 around or Dan will be in town or something so I just like yeah I just

00:57:34.05 stared could have wrote me a letter I could have also texted you I have your

00:57:37.15 a heavier that's true I'm not complaining I wasn't saying like

00:57:40.21 uh I'm just saying I'm just saying I found out quickly that a week can feel

00:57:44.11 like a hell of a lot longer than a week so a month to Andrew could be like a

00:57:48.03 year what it depending on what he does with it yeah just yeah it's the time

00:57:52.00 there are certain weeks that are extremely long and other weeks that go

00:57:57.17 by immediately so I feel like Andrew and myself have hardly been talking yeah

00:58:02.23 ever since the end of uh survive Block Island people are gonna make a lot of

00:58:08.02 assumptions about that statement you don't play Halo anymore we should I mean

00:58:12.20 this is episode 117. This is this is we should play Halo I've still gotten I've

00:58:18.02 done every weekly challenge since Halo infinite released I'm still doing that

00:58:22.06 so and if Co-op still isn't out Co-op still isn't out Forge isn't out yet but

00:58:26.03 that looks like it's coming out soon and some of the stuff people built in it is

00:58:30.19 insane a lot of people who wanted to wanted us to try and do.

00:58:35.16 Halo 2 lasso without sorry no I didn't I didn't think that would

00:58:40.09 ever be done it's amazing that somebody did it I've been meaning has it been

00:58:44.23 done now yeah somebody did it like last week and it was the person that was the

00:58:49.15 closest I think it took him like eight hours or seven hours maybe how how is

00:58:53.18 that how is that possible so I guess one of the it's only been done on the

00:58:58.04 original Halo 2 Xbox version because there's something with I think like the

00:59:02.07 frame rate that prevents the ability to shoot frequently like there's a slower

00:59:06.22 firing rate on the old console so I don't think anyone's been able to do it

00:59:10.23 on the Master Chief Collection which has a higher firing rate

00:59:15.07 um but it's a lot of like glitches and jumps and

00:59:17.14 this is a guy that like put in a lot of practice ahead of time like I think his

00:59:21.13 thing was speed running Halo 2. I could be wrong I don't know a lot about the

00:59:25.12 person that did it I just couldn't imagine being in the boss fight for like

00:59:29.15 regret where you have to like climb on and punch him in the face and this.

00:59:33.22 Elites all underneath you and then if I die there I'm back at Cairo station I

00:59:38.10 can't get my head around that feeling yes I I can't imagine get beating Cairo

00:59:43.08 station yeah yeah a very small percentage even accomplished that it's an insane

00:59:49.12 it's an insane feat that the person accomplished it's amazing well

00:59:55.10 congratulations to streamer gervilin I think it's your Valen

01:00:46.13 podcast that is a video show uh about 10

01:00:48.23 minutes long we'll let you know but in addition to that I feel like we should

01:00:52.23 say because I've seen people asking about it and people are going like they

01:00:56.04 haven't mentioned it since they initially talked about it the animated

01:00:59.12 faces are coming there it's dated they're actually we have a release date

01:01:03.10 I don't know if it's been announced I don't know if I should give that release

01:01:07.18 date because these things tend to slip uh but we have uh we have there are

01:01:12.22 multiple episodes in the pipeline we've seen

01:01:15.06 two or three and they're fantastic and they're really really awesome and

01:01:19.23 they've done an amazing job making us look uh funny and like humans real

01:01:24.17 humans uh and so those will be by the way

01:01:29.02 the animated pickle one the the pickles on Gavin's ports that's one of the
