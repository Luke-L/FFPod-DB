00:00:00.00 Foreign.

00:00:07.22 [Music]

00:00:14.23 Hello and welcome to another episode of the F**kFuckFacePodcast my name is Geoff Ramsey

00:00:21.00 with me as always Andrew Panton and Gavin Free my two favorite people in the

00:00:26.10 world sorry Millie but you're not listening to this anyway so it's okay uh

00:00:31.12 what episode are we at does anybody have any idea 121 I believe yeah once I once

00:00:37.22 I quit chronicling uh your volume uh etc etc season I just completely lost it

00:00:44.11 I'll be honest I was a fan of the volumes of the chapters of the years and

00:00:48.12 the volumes I was I was too Gathering I was too I don't I I feel like we weren't

00:00:53.19 against it as much as I didn't understand the system Andrew and Eric

00:00:58.11 refused they were very they were very against it uh they're very clearly

00:01:03.08 against it they said no no more Geoff fine you know we have no Nick and Eric

00:01:08.15 today we wore those little guys out this morning Gavin we went out uh it was

00:01:13.04 baseball's round two how'd it go I'm very excited to hear about this well let

00:01:17.09 me you know what I mean I know how I think it went let me ask you gab how do

00:01:21.00 you think it went uh I think you came out there you were potentially in worse

00:01:25.21 shape you've been recently injured easily in worship and uh you cracked out

00:01:31.13 more hits than you did last time are you serious he I think he had a streak of

00:01:36.15 about 15 hits at one point it's a chef I had a good morning I'll say heaven is

00:01:42.00 right dude uh I am in worse shape than last time I hit the balls that is uh not

00:01:48.20 by design it is the unfortunate side effect of of having uh the jock itch and

00:01:54.14 the uh the bike falls and the vasectomy uh I just haven't been able to get on my

00:02:01.02 bike or do any kind of exercise all pretty much all summer and so I came in

00:02:07.03 about 10 pounds heavier and Wayward I came very close to vomiting twice

00:02:12.12 really yeah I had to take breaks to go sit in the.

00:02:15.19 Dugout and pour water on my head yeah you have to sit in the breeze and he was

00:02:21.04 just sort of LED over the way not to hell yeah I was I was

00:02:25.20 very close to vomiting very close but I was able to hold it in

00:02:29.21 um yeah and so we went to a different ballpark this one uh the fence was at

00:02:34.17 315 feet so not the I don't know maybe 200 the other one was I will say I

00:02:39.23 [ __ ] tried my hardest I did not hit one out of the park damn but I got close

00:02:46.15 yeah I was I was I was pinging 270 uh pretty pretty consistently I think one

00:02:52.03 of them looked pretty like 290-ish from where I was did yeah and I think I'm I'm

00:02:57.06 like uh I'll go ahead and say it I'm 100

00:03:00.06 sure I can hit one over that fence uh I I don't want to make excuses a being out

00:03:05.17 of shape but b um that bat I use the same bat you know because the only one I

00:03:11.08 have it's getting pretty Gammy it probably weighs an extra four pounds and

00:03:15.10 it's got like dirt and [ __ ] sticking off of it and grass it's probably like an

00:03:20.05 inch wider than it was it's not the best bat in the world to hit the balls with

00:03:25.08 anymore but you know I I prize consistency

00:03:28.05 um and then the pitching machine this time was Wackadoo I would say like

00:03:32.07 Andrew probably one out of every four pitches was a strike over the plate

00:03:37.03 really and that got pretty frustrating because I hit about

00:03:40.19 200 balls today maybe 225 somewhere around there was my limit and uh and

00:03:45.14 that's it that's it like from this point on we're gonna do it again we have

00:03:49.01 another 250 balls that's gonna be where we do this that's where we're gonna

00:03:52.13 that's when we do the different dips of paint and Gavin okay and and Nick and

00:03:57.01 Eric can hit and we can just everybody can have their own color signature and

00:04:00.09 we you know uh let's get a pitching machine for that

00:04:03.22 one let's get a better pitching well yeah sure now that you guys are gonna

00:04:05.14 hit we'll get a better picture because I don't know if it came across in the

00:04:10.15 videos last time but that pitching machine is it basically is like a a leaf

00:04:14.10 blower tube cutting off yeah the spinning Tire inside and every time you

00:04:18.22 drop a ball in the tire grips it and throws the ball but what you don't

00:04:21.22 really see is that the tire is now spinning at like 30 the speed that it

00:04:26.02 was before so you can't immediately dump another ball yeah because yeah not very

00:04:30.09 fast so you have to wait for it to spin up to speed and if it goes too fast and

00:04:34.05 it goes too high it's the nightmare that

00:04:36.04 thing so is it the same machine that you used yeah it's the same and was it as

00:04:41.18 bad the first time or has it just it's gotten worse it's gotten way worse

00:04:45.02 fascinating yeah way worse uh and it's frustrating too because like the first

00:04:49.14 pitch will be uh nine feet high and then the second feet will hit hit the ground

00:04:54.13 three and a half feet before the plate and then the third pitch uh hooks that

00:05:00.01 takes a dog leg right at my crotch and then the fourth pitch

00:05:03.09 so I got I started to get so frustrated and I just like I stopped trying to hit

00:05:07.12 dingers and I just tried to because I was just getting bored of like watching

00:05:11.09 pitches go by and I I was having a lot of luck signing him like the signatures

00:05:16.08 look way better this time around because I was liberal I was Bernie Sanders with

00:05:21.15 the paint dude and uh how it was slinging everywhere

00:05:25.14 and uh so I just thought I was like [ __ ]

00:05:28.16 it I'm gonna swing for every single bad pitch and I was able to connect with 99

00:05:32.11 of them just because I wasn't trying to put it over the fence

00:05:35.18 um it was just so much fun though so I uh I didn't bring my big camera this

00:05:39.12 time just because I need to use it soon for other work and I don't want it yeah

00:05:43.15 covered in paint or smash so I use my phone and now the back of my phone has a

00:05:47.12 nice sort of bumpy house paint job and there's a little bit of black paint on

00:05:52.06 my green card which I'm gonna try and scratch off at some point

00:05:56.23 on the back of it I've been uh I've been pulling uh black

00:06:01.23 paint out of my arm hair all day um except for except for the right side

00:06:06.14 where I was like oh weird there's no black paint on this side I wonder why

00:06:09.14 and then I realized I remembered over the weekend uh I or Monday for Labor Day

00:06:14.00 I grilled uh like a really nice steak for Emily and I and uh I was not paying

00:06:18.04 attention to what I was doing I was listening to a podcast or something

00:06:21.13 while I was doing while I was grilling and I scored it a little bit too much

00:06:25.07 lighter fluid and I set up a bomb that burned all of

00:06:28.23 the hair off of my right arm didn't cause any damage to the skin but

00:06:34.15 I came back inside and I held it up to Emily and I was just like look at this

00:06:38.14 and she was like oh my god do we need to go to the hospital and I just like I

00:06:42.19 just took my hand and brushed my arm here and it just all hit the ground in

00:06:48.07 like little little bird nug little nubbins it was that's a clear example of

00:06:52.08 how Emily are different because if you came in like that my first thought would

00:06:56.04 be oh my God are the stakes okay fantastic

00:07:00.01 well Geoff I think you're stronger than a

00:07:03.01 machine is what we've established you're Better Built than the machine used to

00:07:08.07 pitch the ball you have only improved over time when it has lessened here's

00:07:13.12 what pisses me off about it too um I I hit a rhythm about a hundred

00:07:18.23 balls in when I was like I was really really starting to see the ball I was

00:07:24.01 making contact nine out of every 10

00:07:26.20 pitches that I swung at and uh and I was

00:07:30.06 hitting them pretty consistently like to about 250 to 275 dead center field and

00:07:35.02 that's also like right as I'm dialing in

00:07:36.23 and I'm starting to hit my groove that's

00:07:39.03 also when my body starts to shut down uh for lack of cardio and so like right as

00:07:44.03 I was like starting to feel it I started to feel it uh the other way and so it

00:07:48.01 was like a constant battle between like man it's like the epitome of the mind is

00:07:53.12 willing you know but the body yeah the body's a [ __ ] [ __ ]

00:07:56.23 Um yeah I I'm actually I was thinking about on the way home I'm actually kind

00:08:02.01 of mad at myself for the alcoholism thing because if I hadn't been so

00:08:06.20 distracted by booze in my 30s I could have played so much [ __ ] baseball it

00:08:12.14 is so much fun and I feel so like I don't know maybe it's just like

00:08:16.08 growing up in America and watching baseball all the time and playing little

00:08:19.06 league and [ __ ] but I just feel so connected to it like it just feels like

00:08:23.04 it just like it just feels I feel good at it you know like I want to do it more

00:08:27.00 yeah at one point after you came back for a rest after hitting probably 80.

00:08:30.18 Bulls uh you said you it was off to you with slept over trying not to vomit you

00:08:36.00 just went back and you were like man I hate this age [Laughter]

00:08:42.08 it's easy to forget that out of the [ __ ] 47 year old dude out there doing

00:08:47.20 that you know so are you gonna try to pursue playing baseball recreationally

00:08:52.08 or do you think it's specifically the hitting part of the game you enjoy do

00:08:56.01 you think you'd have fun in an actual game or you're on second base or

00:09:00.01 whatever just waiting yeah I would love to play like Sandlot baseball uh I love

00:09:04.08 I love playing I like to pitch um I would love to play I'm scared to

00:09:08.15 death of playing in field it's too it's too much math it's too many it's too

00:09:11.14 mean it's like too much knowing which scenario to throw to so I much prefer to

00:09:15.20 play Outfield um but uh we're worst case scenery just

00:09:19.13 throw the ball home you know you can't go wrong yeah uh

00:09:22.13 oh it's baseball gets stressful in the moment it's it's all about making snap

00:09:25.20 decisions and making the right snap decision based on the environment and uh

00:09:30.06 but I don't think so because I'm just not good at scheduling stuff now you

00:09:33.10 know I'm at the age where it's like it's hard for me to show up on a point at an

00:09:37.06 appointment or in order to want to make an appointment and so I just like life

00:09:40.16 life so gets in the way you know every day I just don't think it's a reality

00:09:44.13 but I'll continue to hit these baseballs as long as the audience wants

00:09:48.07 autographed baseballs it is so much fun to do and I'm so excited to get Gavin

00:09:52.20 and Eric and Nick involved too that will I think way more signed balls from this

00:09:58.02 batch so I think if you buy from this slot you'll you're more likely to get a

00:10:01.16 a nice paint stain yeah interesting I didn't I didn't I didn't strike out a

00:10:07.12 lot uh today um also uh uh Blaine and Andrew showed up to help uh

00:10:12.22 not you Andrew the uh Ericsson Andrew showed up to uh to help uh catch balls

00:10:18.09 and that was really appreciative too so I want to say thank you to them

00:10:23.12 um sweet yeah Wayne gave me sunscreen and lent me a hat

00:10:26.16 Blaine gave Gavin uh I thought he was being funny but I don't think he was no

00:10:32.02 he was being he knew when he was doing well I don't know

00:10:35.01 he brought a tube of the most viscous sunscreen it was like it came out like

00:10:39.08 toothpaste and he just was squeezing it on my hand and it was like you got

00:10:42.22 enough you need more and he just kept squeezing it into like a big dog turd on

00:10:46.13 my hand and uh I couldn't rub it all in I was offering it around and eventually

00:10:50.16 I just made it on my shin and I just kept the mound of sunscreen on my shin

00:10:55.15 for the entire day what used to get from

00:10:58.19 my leg and stuff did you see him use the sunscreen Gavin

00:11:02.04 no no interest let's see how you're feeling tomorrow [Laughter]

00:11:15.00 Nick can I tell you guys um before we get off the baseball thing

00:11:20.06 I uh I I encountered a little bit of friction with my with my girlfriend over

00:11:25.12 this for like the first time oh no not bad but like the other day uh she was

00:11:31.08 actually last night she was like uh what

00:11:32.10 do you got going on the rest of the week

00:11:34.06 and I was like oh I'm getting up and I'm hitting the baseballs tomorrow morning

00:11:37.19 and she goes really I was like what do you mean and she was like

00:11:40.23 you can barely walk you just go you're just now getting over your bike injury

00:11:45.23 before that it was the jock itch and the

00:11:48.10 and the vasectomy and then the jock itch before that like you have been you've

00:11:52.11 been you've been a neutered physical mess for like three months and you're

00:11:56.08 and do you remember how you felt after the last time you hit the baseballs and

00:11:59.14 I was like I felt pretty bad and she was like you were [ __ ] up you were [ __ ]

00:12:03.04 Up for three straight weeks and I was like yeah and she's like and you're

00:12:06.20 gonna do that again tomorrow and I was like I guess so and she's just like

00:12:11.21 and then uh and then today I was so excited like I

00:12:15.18 knew I was in worse shape but I was thinking like I'm gonna stretch better I

00:12:19.05 know what to expect so I think I'll probably fare better right uh physically

00:12:22.22 and I feel by the way I feel [ __ ]

00:12:25.02 great right now um I came home I immediately ran a hot

00:12:28.19 bath filled it with epsom salts got into the bathtub and thought I'm just gonna

00:12:33.21 sit here and let my muscles relax and I'll be completely okay I looked at my

00:12:38.21 phone and it said 1219 p.m and I thought why does that matter to me I

00:12:42.19 don't have face till three o'clock why would I care that it's why does 1219

00:12:48.06 seem bad and I was like uh so then I like slowly looked hit my calendar and

00:12:52.15 sure enough I was supposed to be at rooster teeth at one o'clock to do this

00:12:56.03 interview show thing and I was like God damn it and I had to rush out of the

00:13:00.13 bath and then throw clothes on and then immediately go to work I took off I took

00:13:05.19 a 45 second bath and then immediately you now know my pain when I when I saw

00:13:11.21 Kevin you wanna when he beat the Halo time you can now relate to the sadness

00:13:16.21 of realizing you have to get out immediately as soon as you get dead

00:13:20.23 absolutely dude I feel your pain it sucks what's kind of interesting about

00:13:25.07 all the baseballs we hit is that I'm pretty sure some of them were hit while

00:13:29.06 the queen was alive and some of them were hit after she died like that's

00:13:33.20 exactly what we were doing I think the moment Queen Elizabeth died yeah my

00:13:38.20 condolences uh to like honest condolences to to everybody uh affected

00:13:43.23 uh by the Queen's death that's very very sad of it and um however life I read a

00:13:49.18 stat today and I texted to you and Eric Geoff the uh the queen has the queen was

00:13:55.19 alive for 30 of all the presidents she was the queen yeah isn't that crazy she

00:14:00.20 was the queen during the presidential I'll get 14 different presents let's say

00:14:04.23 30 of our country essentially I mean it doesn't shake out that way because of

00:14:08.15 like how many terms the president had but yeah but still it's roughly and

00:14:12.04 Harry S Truman who only exists in history books distantly exists in

00:14:16.16 history books to me was the president when she uh took over the monarchy that

00:14:21.22 is insane yeah Winston Churchill was the.

00:14:24.20 Prime Minister when she became Queen and then she just put in the newest prime

00:14:29.18 minister that just happened this week and those two people were born 101 years

00:14:36.01 apart those two prime ministers she also she also uh presided over 15 Prime.

00:14:41.12 Ministers if I if I've survived for 30 of the

00:14:45.09 presidencies 15 Prime Ministers but not the Game of Thrones books finishing I

00:14:50.20 would be so [ __ ] mad I would be livid be so frustrating [Laughter]

00:14:58.16 She was still born like 60

00:15:00.19 for the first Game of Thrones books no I understand but it's just it is they're

00:15:04.21 taking forever they're taking a long book If I Was A Game of Thrones fan I

00:15:08.08 don't know if she read the books I don't know what she was into from a literary

00:15:11.22 perspective but I'd be like what are you doing like I get it's tough but be so

00:15:16.22 frustrating I got news for you I think we're all gonna be frustrated I don't

00:15:22.15 think that's I don't think JJ or George R Martin said JJ Martin I don't think

00:15:28.06 George RR Martin is in any danger of finishing those last two books anytime

00:15:32.19 soon and he uh let's just say he hasn't he hasn't lived as healthy a life as the

00:15:38.07 queen did I suspect how old is he he's got to be in the 60s or 70s right I'd

00:15:43.05 assume 70s yeah but I just don't think there's any need for him to finish I

00:15:46.12 just don't if I was him I don't know why I would finish that's a weird thing I

00:15:49.16 guess it's not gonna please everyone people are gonna be annoyed he's 73.

00:15:53.11 Yeah he's he's basically made something so successful the people are annoyed at

00:15:57.10 him that it's not finished I disagree I think that it will please I think that

00:16:01.06 the books will please everybody because here's the deal the T the people that

00:16:05.05 love Game of Thrones the TV show aren't necessarily reading the books and but

00:16:09.14 everybody who reads the book I don't know anybody who's read the books who

00:16:13.07 didn't like them I wonder how close the ending of the show matches with what he

00:16:18.23 planned on doing very different interesting yeah supposedly very

00:16:22.04 different and that's part of uh maybe he was thinking of doing it the way the

00:16:26.16 show did it and then just thought it's such a weird scenario yeah it's a

00:16:30.20 great it's it's it's a free a b testing right they throw it out there yeah

00:16:35.19 it's like putting your book into Early Access I'll do something different with.

00:16:39.10 Clegane then all right.

00:16:41.21 I have a clip oh no but a clip Kevin has a clip oh I was informed of this

00:16:47.15 yesterday and I've decided to not be concerned because last time I went on

00:16:52.23 the aggressive and it actually helped me I don't remember what the clip was but

00:16:57.16 it's the first time that it wasn't directed at me

00:17:00.06 so this time I'm just gonna let it happen I'm not worried about it I

00:17:04.09 haven't planned anything what's your clip Gavin uh this is a clip from an

00:17:10.04 episode two weeks ago September 2022. Previously my chair had been

00:17:15.00 broken for months and I had continued to use it out of the hope that it would

00:17:19.19 completely collapse while we're recording at one point it finally it hit

00:17:24.10 its last legs last night I ate [ __ ] and I was so disappointed

00:17:29.01 that it was not on the show I had been hoping so this was after you talked

00:17:34.05 about it breaking last time this has happened yes this was that was after it

00:17:37.22 was broken but I was still making it work and now I have to go buy a new

00:17:43.03 chair because I didn't dump you off it dumped me yesterday okay um September

00:17:48.16 2021 oh yeah

00:17:54.17 broken desktop chair for this podcast start

00:17:59.01 my dream was that it would break while we were recording

00:18:03.20 that's the same story back to back and uh yesterday I dropped something and I

00:18:09.10 went I bent down to pick it up although the chair and the chairs broke finally

00:18:13.22 it was the end dumped me on the floor and then obviously we've got

00:18:27.10 all over that last one's from the Fourth of July party I like the fact that you

00:18:32.20 are a Serial chair breaker almost once a year now we get a story like the

00:18:39.07 one that you told last week that surely wasn't the same chair that was a

00:18:43.23 different cheer story just happened very similarly both and so like right around

00:18:49.15 the same time like it's about every September that's fast September 2022

00:18:54.00 September 2021 and then in November 2020

00:18:57.16 you told the uh the Fourth of July one but

00:19:00.11 I think you talked recently about how your chair was breaking and you hoped it

00:19:05.01 was going to break it how many chairs have you broken I've broken three chairs

00:19:10.05 you've just documented all three all the

00:19:13.09 chairs that broke so how I don't know if I told the story of the podcast how the

00:19:16.21 last one I had broke why it got broken was that there so it has armrests on it

00:19:21.19 that like go up and down and it was a time in which I had really hurt like I

00:19:26.10 was dealing with an ankle issue that was really bad and so my bed is level with

00:19:31.03 my chair and so I would roll out of the chair into the bed and then roll out of

00:19:36.20 the bed onto the chair so I'd go back and forth I rolled onto the bed

00:19:40.19 forgetting to raise the armrest and I took the whole chair down with me and

00:19:45.21 that is what initially [ __ ] that chair up because I took it I landed on it on

00:19:50.20 its side and then it was chair three that was chair three yeah so it was what

00:19:56.07 was the issue with chair two because chair too the day before cheer two I

00:20:01.13 owned for like a decade and it just progressively broke over okay it was

00:20:06.17 just a natural failing of it the the chair three had only a one year life

00:20:11.15 lifespan like almost a perfect year and it's ever since that fall it could never

00:20:17.07 fully recover and then I partially broke it a second time sort of in a similar

00:20:21.19 way to the second chair where the front was tilted the entire time uh and then

00:20:26.02 it just it finally gave when I I went into the Tony Hawk Grind Mode trying to

00:20:30.15 pick something up I that was that was I was so excited for

00:20:35.02 next year's chair story I can't I don't I don't know what's gonna happen I don't

00:20:40.00 want any more trading stores I have a question here Gavin are you saying that

00:20:44.10 you've been using the same chair this entire the entirety of this podcast yeah

00:20:49.12 oh yeah I got this chair in 2016 I think how many chairs have you

00:20:53.19 gone through I'm on my third chair he's on Geoff's on the third chair what about

00:20:57.14 you I the others didn't break but like well one of them broke the first one was

00:21:01.10 like half you know how like uh like the Hydraulics break on a chair and

00:21:05.02 it won't stay up anymore just like slowly sinks down I got rid of one of

00:21:08.07 those and then I got a second chair and it was just uncomfortable so now I'm on

00:21:11.11 my third maybe my fourth chair honestly I feel like uh I feel like it's a this

00:21:15.23 is a revolving chair podcast it is yeah that was I didn't mention it either that

00:21:19.18 was one of my favorite things that broke on once I went into the Tony Hawk like

00:21:24.13 before that when it was really broken but not fully dead the Hydraulics broke

00:21:28.08 on it so every time I'd get off of it it would slowly raise to its highest point

00:21:33.02 and it would shut down whatever it was fantastic it's a lot of fun I'm sad that

00:21:38.05 that chair is dead I think we should get you a chair that

00:21:42.06 will last maybe a custom chair ah yeah I'm not opposed to that idea at all I'm

00:21:47.17 fine with this chair right now I'll get a year out of this ideally and then

00:21:51.23 maybe so is this a new one you've got now yes it is well relatively now I

00:21:56.03 guess whenever the last one broke since that point yeah here's something I want

00:21:59.22 to talk about that you just reminded me of okay I saw a thing I I saw as it was

00:22:05.10 posted I believe on the subreddit there's a tick tock of a cup that got

00:22:09.00 invented they took some of the gurpler technology what it's a real thing

00:22:14.04 I wish I could find you know how in my design document I pitched the idea of

00:22:18.02 like a deck a cards when you fan it out like that would be the top that you

00:22:22.08 close there's a cup that does that let me see if I can find the post yeah I

00:22:26.16 need to I need visuals I'm confused if this is the thing that I came up with

00:22:31.01 and someone else also came up with and created or if I saw it before I don't

00:22:35.02 remember how I came to that point of Designing the group let's see if it's on

00:22:38.18 the subreddit or actually I know where I could find it but it's if you remember

00:22:42.16 like my cup ridiculous designer had the parachute it had the wings on the side

00:22:47.19 of it but it had Wheels yeah just you want to

00:22:51.12 slide it down uh but the main one of the

00:22:53.22 main points of design was I wanted a top that you could fan to close so it could

00:22:59.20 be open or closed so in the event that you're worried it would it would spill

00:23:03.22 uh one second here

00:23:07.03 um have you ever broken a chair Gavin uh oh I must have broken one at work at

00:23:12.14 some point I would imagine you've broken everything breakable at work uh

00:23:17.14 well I mean Jeremy burnt my desk [Music]

00:23:21.05 that's true hey while you're looking for this can I just say uh on a whim I

00:23:27.00 looked on the store just before we started recording do you know what's

00:23:32.18 what we still have more of that's still in stock

00:23:36.04 uh grow tubes grow tubes yeah we have done a phenomenally piss-poor job of

00:23:42.17 telling you oh terrible that the ground tubes are in the store I'm sure by the

00:23:49.03 time you hear this they'll be gone but they've been in the store for like three

00:23:53.13 weeks and nobody has cared or noticed we haven't posted a single time I think we

00:23:58.02 might have posted once like right when they hit uh but we certainly haven't

00:24:02.18 talked about it and promoted it like we do like if we could sell a thousand bat

00:24:06.19 knobs and a thousand uh uh Pink port a potty Tiki mugs I would think we could

00:24:12.01 sell I think the growing tubes are arguably great we're arguably more

00:24:17.17 desired uh for sure and uh than those other two items and we just uh

00:24:21.10 we've had like 600 of them just like sitting there collecting dust and I just

00:24:25.12 I can't believe uh I can't believe we've done it's I'll I'll take the plane for

00:24:31.18 it it's all my fault I [ __ ] up this uh I in my head because they were at RTX

00:24:36.14 uh and you could buy them at our convention then they had already been

00:24:39.14 out and they had already existed and I just have not been able to flip that

00:24:44.17 switch in my head well it's been it kind of came at an unfortunate time where

00:24:48.07 they were available in our store around the same time we were filming survived.

00:24:53.10 Block Island meltdown yeah so we're all busy doing something else and then by

00:24:57.11 the time like that was such a an event to get through that by the time we

00:25:00.20 finished that it just sort of I think slipped all of our minds for different

00:25:04.07 reasons yeah I hope uh I hope we do a better job with this round of baseballs

00:25:07.13 because we put some work into them today I'm sure we will and it sounds like all

00:25:11.04 of the issues have been sorted out with the store as far as release time goes

00:25:16.09 yes I think so I think so okay yeah so here's the the cup so you can see it has

00:25:21.23 a Twist oh it's like a sphincter lid and you seal it and it's the coolest

00:25:27.09 thing I've ever seen though that was part of my design yet the Fanning you

00:25:32.17 twist it you could seal it and through you're so brilliant I think I might be a

00:25:39.04 little like maybe 10 cup genius I I don't think the other things are

00:25:42.09 radical if it's oh if it's on the straw you could tighten the straw yeah I mean

00:25:47.18 I didn't even that's an innovation I did not consider but it just it's weird to

00:25:52.04 come up with something and then see it actually executed in a way that is

00:25:56.12 better than you could have imagined but it's still like the base idea is the

00:26:01.15 same I think you need to do we still have access to online law firms I think

00:26:05.09 that we should we're gonna hire our Lord to shoot the [ __ ] out of tick tock

00:26:10.07 yeah an old system what has happened with the

00:26:14.23 gerp lair why we have we sold those yet just talking about stuff I'm excited

00:26:20.12 we're getting them we're getting them made they're being made I don't know

00:26:24.12 what the status of them is but uh I I feel like it's just the same thing we

00:26:28.21 always say supply chain you know yes like [ __ ] it's harder to get uh get

00:26:32.13 manufactured um but yeah we're definitely making

00:26:35.18 gerblers and I anticipate the gerbler being hopefully the all-time like best

00:26:40.18 received best best sold item uh the space has because I I really do think

00:26:46.22 that that's uh that's pretty nice I think it's too useful laughs

00:26:51.23 we haven't got them in our hands yet Kevin I feel like the face Nails useless

00:26:58.18 crap knob oh what if we drill a hole in the bottom of every gurbler.

00:27:06.03 I didn't about using the gerbler a monthly subscription for the plug to

00:27:11.06 seal the whole like it will be [ __ ] up in a way that

00:27:14.21 we did not anticipate I think that's locked in like there will be some issue

00:27:20.20 with it it'll it'll be spelled it'll be like gruple or something

00:27:26.04 foreign well I just ran out baseballs I just

00:27:31.11 want to say I'm impressed Geoff you did a great job it sounds like I'm excited to

00:27:36.08 see the products released I honestly thought that you would have had a drop

00:27:40.16 off because I've never done the baseball things but as somebody who did Burgers

00:27:45.22 multiple times every time I did Burgers I felt like I lost a little bit of

00:27:49.12 myself and each attempt after was a step back or it was more of a struggle even

00:27:55.09 if I did better like it just was a more difficult thing to get through so the

00:27:59.03 fact that you have only improved in your hitting even though your body is in a

00:28:03.22 worse State oh it's truly impressive well I thanks man and I I appreciate it

00:28:08.15 I will admit that I was a bit afraid that I I I over performed because it was

00:28:13.23 in front of my girlfriend and her parents the first time you know which uh

00:28:19.06 a lot a lot of pressure I could have like that could have like

00:28:23.10 her parents could have walked away and been like you you gotta dump this dude

00:28:26.22 he's [ __ ] he can't hit a 45 mile an hour ball to save his life and we had no

00:28:31.16 beans waiting for us this time nice yeah no beans this time either so it was it

00:28:35.15 was affirming uh to get the feeling that it wasn't beginner's luck I I I

00:28:40.06 appreciate that foreign

00:33:01.05 um do you do you guys anything else because I had one other thing I mean one

00:33:05.18 small thing but yeah you could do yours first no you do your small thing well I

00:33:10.09 okay I just I need to pull something for

00:33:13.12 it so if you want to go first okay uh so I feel like everybody was excited about

00:33:19.08 uh I was really excited about the end cap

00:33:23.03 contest and there was a lot of potential a lot of possibility and I thought it

00:33:29.05 was a clever a clever contest and I uh I

00:33:32.05 feel like it had been a while since we'd had something like that and I think

00:33:35.23 maybe that's part of part of what was so exciting about it uh having a good good

00:33:39.02 old face uh competition going on and then it kind of fell flat because it

00:33:43.18 turns out that Canada has wider end caps than aisles right like like it would

00:33:48.19 have been harder to eat off the aisles and ignore the impacts

00:33:52.02 because all the useful [ __ ] is there yeah which also kind of makes sense if

00:33:56.12 you think about it you go into a grocery store you're in caps are where all the

00:34:00.05 important [ __ ] uh is in Canada you don't

00:34:02.05 even have to go down the aisles so [ __ ]

00:34:04.05 them uh it's just where all the bad cereal is I guess uh but I wanna

00:34:08.18 competition I want to come

00:34:13.12 on uh of actually I was reminded of an old uh RvB bit

00:34:20.05 um that like a joke throwaway joke and RvB about Griff eating uh based on the

00:34:26.11 alphabet and then Emily was like doesn't Andrew have uh has that uh like Bingo

00:34:33.19 thing on his desk right do you still have the Bingo machine

00:34:37.19 where you can I do bubbles that's in my closet here's what I propose

00:34:42.22 what if we did a contest and it could be one of us it could be all three of us I

00:34:47.03 like the idea of it not being me but uh where we put 26 balls numbered one

00:34:51.14 through 26 into your bingo thing okay and you pull one out and whatever number

00:34:57.07 you pull out there's a letter associated

00:35:00.12 with that number uh A through Z right so you pull out okay the equivalent of the

00:35:05.15 letter I now for the next week you can only eat food that begins with the

00:35:10.12 letter I oh okay God you could have some bad

00:35:14.07 weeks you could have a lot of baked zinc so what's the the goal would be to go

00:35:19.08 through all 26 so this would be a 26

00:35:22.16 week thing no the goal would just be like that it's just that it's just a

00:35:26.04 random way to pick a letter so we could just potentially pick three numbers and

00:35:30.01 we'll each take one and that's our food for the week yeah potentially like Gavin

00:35:33.16 you could get B and you could be like oh

00:35:36.05 it's Burgers all week for Gavin and then next best I can get X and I have to

00:35:40.09 re-pull because there's no food that's x uh you know you could get C and be like

00:35:46.06 I guess I'm eating a lot of coconuts and chicken you know cheese D it's like I

00:35:52.01 hope I like dumplings uh hey but you you were just you're confined to anything

00:35:56.04 that starts with that letter okay so just let's do an important qualifier

00:36:01.13 here okay if I pull C could I have Grill can I have grilled

00:36:06.09 chicken or is that a g yeah I think C is chicken

00:36:09.22 okay so any variation of it so if I had teriyaki chicken that's still just

00:36:14.20 chicken the tea doesn't matter yeah okay is that too easy there

00:36:19.14 if you guys see it's pretty [ __ ] easy it is pretty easy

00:36:23.22 what are you gonna do with an in uh it's a lot of nigiri what if I think

00:36:31.16 this is a fun idea we could all new potatoes there you go you can have them

00:36:37.21 yeah sure you can have nugs [Laughter]

00:36:43.18 I really like this idea I know you don't you ideally didn't want to be involved

00:36:48.14 with this Geoff but I think it would be fun if we each had the poll like no I

00:36:52.14 agree I agree and what if we just do it for the weekend this weekend

00:36:56.15 now weekend is too easy I think a full week I think and this is a thing that we

00:37:01.16 could come back to in the future yeah I think like the next time we record we

00:37:06.01 pull our numbers between that recording on the next one we uh we I can show the

00:37:11.05 pictures of all the food fantastic idea yeah do we want to do a thing where we

00:37:16.16 pick what letters are in the rotation each of us I think it's got to be all of

00:37:21.13 them you want to put all the letters in I'm just I like the idea of potentially

00:37:25.07 us picking like oh I really want P Pizza I could live off of pizza easily that'd

00:37:30.19 be a great letter to have if I put it in wanting it for myself but then Gavin

00:37:35.04 pulls pee do you are you saying that we should

00:37:38.15 have the ability to eliminate letters like a lot like yeah like Rainbow Six.

00:37:43.07 Siege like you're like no nobody nobody can play tachanka this game uh we voted

00:37:48.12 against it yeah like that kind of idea or it could just be all of them I just

00:37:52.03 think there's a lot of choice we can make as far as how we select these

00:37:56.12 letters and if we want because nobody wants like an X

00:37:59.23 yeah uh apparently there's I found a list of 19 foods that start with the

00:38:05.01 letter X oh well there you go what is one of them this is a lapa punch

00:38:10.06 uh xantham gum my favorite oh Xavier soup oh I love an Xavier soup

00:38:18.17 the soup combines dumplings with chicken stock that actually does a salty and

00:38:24.10 simple meal that's great yeah it's a steak what's that dumplings and steaks

00:38:28.04 steak topped with Worcestershire sauce asparagus beers Swiss cheese and olive

00:38:34.03 oil that's less appealing but that might be okay uh CME

00:38:38.05 that sounds like a lot of Chinese food dried shrimp that have been sun dried

00:38:41.08 and shrunk to the size of a thumbnail the shrimp are added to a variety of

00:38:44.20 Asian dishes and okay there's some stuff out there if we were

00:38:48.12 able to do it I'm gonna let you guys know now I'm Banning like B or C I'm

00:38:52.06 gonna ban the most common letters if we do the Banning otherwise uh I say we

00:38:55.21 just do the 26 letters okay do you assume you want to do full

00:38:59.23 alphabet or do we want to do a thing where we we pick letters to be in the

00:39:03.14 hopper I think philosophy I don't know I have no idea I think I think full

00:39:09.03 alphabet full alphabet how how is this a

00:39:12.06 food xylitol is a chemical compound used in many foods blah blah it can't be

00:39:16.21 consumed by humans it's highly toxic to dogs you can't just have a cup of.

00:39:21.23 Xylitol well you sounds like you shouldn't that's terrible

00:39:25.22 well let's just [ __ ] pray nobody gets Z well like I don't even know like foods

00:39:31.11 that begin with you what what can you have uh uh

00:39:36.00 what about so it has to be the food name it can't be a restaurant right so if I

00:39:41.03 if I thought of a you place I couldn't eat anything from there unagi is good I

00:39:48.03 mean I oh God this is brutal uh uh does not get you ha ha ha

00:39:55.02 you get to eat something called ugly fruit I feel like we should have the whole

00:40:01.23 alphabet in there and you get what you get some people might get very lucky

00:40:06.22 yeah now okay so A variation of this because let's say as I said if I get p I

00:40:12.06 could easily eat pizza every day of every I could go a month on Pizza no

00:40:17.05 problem yeah can you use is there like a cap on how many days you can use a

00:40:21.21 letter for like if you put P down is it worth two days of the week and then you

00:40:26.01 have to switch to something else no I think that over complicates it well

00:40:29.15 we're trying I think it's already kind of complicated like we're drawing we're

00:40:34.01 drawing balls for letters and but that's fair I just I just feel like it'll be

00:40:37.18 because that was the problem with the end caps is that it wasn't funny because

00:40:42.09 it was easy if we all have one easy letter

00:40:45.06 then I just that makes it funny though if someone gets a b and someone gets a q

00:40:51.20 yeah like if if Gavin gets pee for pizza and I get B for burgers and Andrew gets

00:40:57.17 q that is that Quince okay well what about whale eggs

00:41:02.07 you have to eat something that is from each letter you have to use all your

00:41:07.08 letters within the week what do you mean if we all we well we're pulling three

00:41:12.03 letters each right no I thought we're only pulling one letter are we only

00:41:15.01 playing letter we're pulling three letters total we each could win was this

00:41:19.03 three got it I thought we were each pulling that's where the confusion was I

00:41:23.17 thought we were each pulling three letters because it was already confusing

00:41:29.20 I was like I don't think it is yeah I had worked this a different I thought

00:41:33.22 we're gonna pull like three letters each and then you'd have a choice between

00:41:37.11 those letters each day of what you can use

00:41:40.00 see because I thought it would be like a

00:41:41.18 tension thing where oh [ __ ] I pulled a z

00:41:43.20 in the first round I'm begging for like a b give me a c in round two that's what

00:41:49.03 I thought in my head not that we'd each only have one to work with I got it okay

00:41:53.10 I think one is funny

00:42:03.05 26 less what no it was not I think I heard what you said created a completely

00:42:09.14 different more convoluted game in my head and then was continuing off of that

00:42:14.21 premise yeah it's very straightforward what you're saying so we just have to

00:42:19.23 apply so will a b one one a two B yeah I think you just I think like that yeah

00:42:25.08 got it I'll get that set up for next time we record and we'll use the English

00:42:30.07 alphabet that'll make the most sense yeah yeah can you guys think of an

00:42:35.12 experience that was cool but was completely lost on you it would be cool

00:42:40.03 to a lot of other people but you would like the wrong person to experience it

00:42:44.05 oh I've probably had a lot of those uh yeah I'm trying to think of hmm like

00:42:49.09 impressive are you thinking like you went vacationing somewhere or you saw

00:42:54.22 like some for me recently I was just thinking I

00:42:57.23 was trying to remember like all the stuff I've done in the last 10 years

00:43:00.23 because I hit uh 10 years at Rooster Teeth I was like man we've done a lot of

00:43:04.19 stuff in that time and like our MLB 2012

00:43:07.15 video which was I think the first let's play I was in after I came back was I

00:43:11.20 looked at it and it was you know two million views or something and it just

00:43:15.07 literally said 10 years ago like not nine it was like passed over to 10 I was

00:43:19.23 like Jesus I was thinking of some of the other stuff I did and uh it's looking

00:43:24.19 back through my phone I was like oh wow yeah I went to uh

00:43:27.15 I went to like a late night talk show and I remember before like after I first

00:43:32.02 moved here I was watching more like talk show content I'd see it pop up on

00:43:35.18 YouTube more I'd be like and I was always confused I always got Jimmy.

00:43:39.01 Fall on and Jimmy Kimmel mixed up and I just could never picture the right one

00:43:44.05 in my head for for the longest time and then I remembered I went I went to the

00:43:48.08 recording of one and I don't remember which Jimmy it was

00:43:53.10 and I know I've been to one was it the what are the names of the shows the late

00:43:59.12 show or the what's the other one uh I have no idea the actual titles are The.

00:44:04.18 Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon or uh I don't know the Jimmy Kimmel show I think

00:44:10.06 yeah and I just remember thinking like man I used to get them mixed up and now

00:44:13.19 I can picture them in my head better but I I know that I went to see a recording

00:44:17.23 and I have absolutely no idea which one it was and I'm just thinking like that

00:44:21.22 would that that was an experience wasted on me like it was a cool experience but

00:44:25.16 it I just took nothing away from it like I don't even know who who I was seeing

00:44:30.10 and I was kind of embarrassed that I went and that's the experience I've Come.

00:44:36.14 Away with just wasted on me hmm I would wager that like half of the video game

00:44:42.03 should I've been to uh like premieres or like of launch events and stuff it's

00:44:47.20 just like at some point they just kind of like

00:44:50.07 I don't know they just kind of all are the same thing and then you're like this

00:44:53.21 would probably be a really cool like E3

00:44:55.18 like after the second time you go to E3

00:44:57.18 you're like man this would be a lot of fun for somebody to come in my place who

00:45:01.16 hasn't been before because it's already like wearing thin pretty quickly with me

00:45:06.00 you know yeah and there's definitely been some experiences for me where my

00:45:10.22 cool experience was like an introduction to that game or to that genre and I'm

00:45:16.05 not a fan of it at the time and then because of that experience I'll look

00:45:19.23 into it and I'll get really into it and I'll become a fan of the thing that I

00:45:23.10 was at before I was a fan and I'm like damn now I would ask all these different

00:45:27.14 questions yeah you've experienced stuff in the wrong order sometimes I have that

00:45:31.22 I have that with bands a lot or I used to I don't go to shows anymore but I

00:45:35.05 would like see a band and not know who they were or have heard of them but not

00:45:38.05 be into them like there's this band I really like now one of my favorite bands

00:45:41.18 in my life this band called Hot Water Music and I saw them play live and they

00:45:45.19 the lead singer got well there's two lead singers but one of them got so

00:45:48.22 [ __ ] drunk three songs in that he had to sit on the ground and prop himself up

00:45:54.10 on a like continue singing I was like this is

00:45:57.12 [ __ ] dog [ __ ] and these guys suck and

00:45:59.22 then six months later I was the biggest fan of that band ever and there's been a

00:46:04.03 lot of a lot of those so it's like I wish I could see them again and know the

00:46:08.11 lyrics and to the songs and appreciate them you know yeah

00:46:12.17 I'm trying to I'm sure I've had a lot of those nothing comes to mind I've had

00:46:16.16 times where maybe I didn't understand the

00:46:19.22 value of the experience yeah exactly so like I had one where it was back when I

00:46:25.13 was just doing Achievement Hunter stuff behind the scenes I went through a

00:46:30.23 phaser I was trying to get early game copies for the office and I had

00:46:35.16 developed a contact at Sony and kind of became friends with them like very

00:46:40.19 that's friends is a strong word but we communicated and was friendly and then I

00:46:46.00 got an email randomly saying that I was invited to PlayStations behind the

00:46:50.10 scenes E3 showcase that year and I had no plans on going D3 it was back when.

00:46:55.07 Rooster Teeth would go to E3 and so I forwarded it forwarded it to Trevor I

00:46:59.23 believe I I don't remember who I said I sent to someone that's like hey I got

00:47:03.10 invited to this thing do you want like do we want to cover this does somebody

00:47:06.15 in the office want to go in my place because we have an invite I just can't

00:47:09.22 I'm obviously not going and it was like yeah sure well we could reach out to

00:47:13.06 them so then I emailed the pr person back at Sony and the vibe I got was very

00:47:17.10 much much like no we don't just give these away we can't just no you can't

00:47:21.06 just give your invite to somebody else like I think they took it as like this

00:47:25.16 very uh prestigious like exciting thing to be part of that you would see these

00:47:30.03 games and so for me to write back cool can I give this to somebody else they

00:47:33.22 were not thrilled with that response and I never got a reply back on it was

00:47:38.08 essentially just yeah we do not like we're gonna have to talk to about if

00:47:42.15 we're okay with this and I never heard past that point but that is an

00:47:46.16 experience where I just I thought it was like sort of an open invite type thing

00:47:50.15 and I think it was more behind closed doors than I realized companies that

00:47:55.23 value themselves very highly are incredibly easy to piss off yeah foreign.

00:48:05.10 I have pissed off a few companies in my day uh yeah that's that's definitely

00:48:10.13 true hey I realized something that we didn't talk about yet that we probably

00:48:15.17 should [ __ ] talk about and just completely slipped my mind uh we had our

00:48:21.04 first office day oh yeah we did we had an office there to mention that yeah and

00:48:27.09 it was wildly successful I thought I thought it was a lot of fun I didn't

00:48:31.12 really honestly know what to expect going into it I'm excited for the next

00:48:36.07 one because I feel like I have a better idea for it and uh I can plan more

00:48:41.00 accordingly yeah so like the way it worked is we you know I had this idea I

00:48:44.23 presented it to y'all y'all loved it Eric took it to face Jam another podcast

00:48:48.18 on the network they did it first and then bragged constantly about how

00:48:53.05 successful it was and how they came up with a bunch of new shows and so but I

00:48:58.06 thought put a lot of pressure on us oh definitely 100 and I'm sure nobody else

00:49:02.16 on Earth felt the pressure but us us and probably Gavin didn't feel it at

00:49:06.19 all but I certainly did I'm like these [ __ ] took her idea and they're

00:49:10.11 gonna do it better than us now now we gotta we gotta outperform I just think

00:49:13.16 you're a cooler customer I don't think you're affected by stuff I'm so I'm so

00:49:17.05 nervous about the show did I tell you about the freak out I had a couple of

00:49:20.11 weeks ago no no you know like when you when you have a little bit of anxiety

00:49:24.18 and you wake up from something that usually you'll be able to fall back

00:49:29.10 asleep to but instead your brain just starts thinking in insane Loops I woke

00:49:33.15 up extremely worried about how I couldn't put my finger on the fact that

00:49:38.14 this show I couldn't I couldn't figure out why this show works

00:49:42.23 I was like we're making it and it's good and I don't know how we're doing it

00:49:49.04 freaking out because I couldn't like put it into words like

00:49:53.22 what what's working about it like what are the pitfalls to avoid how like when

00:49:59.04 is it gonna become [ __ ] and like people don't like it anymore

00:50:03.21 that's freaking out oh man well that's terrible I love how

00:50:07.19 passionate you are about this this uh shell and um I uh I share your

00:50:14.10 trepidation and your fears I've constantly I'm nervous about about my

00:50:20.01 face uh it really does feel like somehow we captured lightning in a bottle and I

00:50:25.02 honestly it's best just not to think about it

00:50:28.04 if at all possible but but to go back I certainly wasn't trying to insult you in

00:50:32.08 any way that you don't care about space I just feel like you're you're just a

00:50:35.12 cooler customer you're more unflappable you know like you're harder to get under

00:50:38.20 your skin about this kind of stuff you know what it felt like to me Geoff what's

00:50:41.23 up with the Eric thing in the face it would be like if we had just invented

00:50:45.22 basketball and he immediately showed us Steph Curry

00:50:49.12 I was like we just had this basic idea of how this could work and that it might

00:50:55.01 be beneficial and immediately oh yeah no we did amazing we did all these amazing

00:50:59.20 things he's like yeah I really like the electric ball in the basket here's a

00:51:04.19 windmill dunk yeah I mean well we're trying to staple the

00:51:08.12 hoop to the backwards yeah exactly how do you think

00:51:12.20 you make a ball out of paper so but let's run through it so we had it

00:51:18.09 and um I felt very good about it uh we agreed to be at work at a certain time

00:51:23.05 and then we zoomed in uh Andrew I got there a little early I grabbed the white

00:51:29.10 board and first off okay but by the way there's some there's there was some

00:51:34.16 subtle uh whiteboard aggression going on that I I feel like I gotta call out we

00:51:39.06 talked about it in uh sausage talk oh yeah well that never mind I won't talk

00:51:43.15 about it because you'll have to listen to sausage talk we should probably talk

00:51:46.22 about what that is so uh grab the Whiteboard wrote down a bunch of ideas

00:51:51.10 for like merch and thought starters and just like directions we want to go

00:51:54.22 things things that are like like dangling [ __ ] that's dangling out there

00:51:58.02 that we need to like tie a bow on and figure out and then everybody came in

00:52:01.18 and we sat around well first off Gavin showed up a little later Eric and Andrew

00:52:06.03 and I had the funniest conversation I've ever had I don't remember what it was

00:52:09.19 but I just remember thinking like we got to stop talking because this is

00:52:14.07 I remember what it is I actually have it in my notes for a thing to talk about

00:52:19.12 because it's a topic that I've had you you and Eric unknowingly put a whole

00:52:23.07 different angle on it I thought I previously had that I've talked to Gavin

00:52:26.20 about I feel like being able to see a place and this kind of sounds

00:52:31.16 counterproductive but being able to see a place makes me want to visit it more

00:52:36.09 than if we were in a time period in which that thing would just have to be

00:52:40.15 described and my example of this is you know that place in Greece where it's

00:52:44.10 like all the the white houses and like the blue roofs yeah yeah like to see

00:52:48.09 that visually beautiful if you met somebody who traveled all that way let's

00:52:52.11 say they had to like take a boat like this is planes maybe not around in a

00:52:57.22 world in which travel is difficult they went there came back and tried to

00:53:01.10 explain why you needed to go there's no way they could sell me on it yeah white

00:53:05.09 houses and blue I could do that like I could just paint my house stuff because

00:53:09.01 there's nothing impressive about that so I was gonna it made me wonder how far

00:53:13.21 would I be willing to travel for something like that and honestly

00:53:17.11 probably not more than four blocks I wouldn't go further it's gonna take a

00:53:23.05 lot if you just describe a landmark to me it's gonna be very difficult for me

00:53:28.05 to be willing to leave my city that was uh maybe okay so when when Geoff

00:53:32.23 and I were in Belgium we went through an Alleyway that was the best smelling.

00:53:37.15 Alleyway we'd ever smelled probably some waffles uh this is like an old story

00:53:42.04 from the old Pocus how far would you travel to smell the

00:53:47.13 best Alleyway that you've ever smelled

00:53:51.00 I've got it no I don't know about that food is definitely more of a needle

00:53:56.23 mover for me 100 but I'm thinking like it smells pretty goddamn good outside my

00:54:01.13 hubby's Bagel sometimes like I don't I don't feel like I'm like you got good

00:54:04.18 you got good smell I feel like I got good smells in my area I'm telling you

00:54:10.02 this would blow it out of the water yeah he's not kidding dude like I think I

00:54:15.01 still think about it sometimes without hyperbole like not being silly it was

00:54:20.18 like it was Unreal and it might have been like it might have been like the most

00:54:25.03 satisfied I've ever been in my life in a

00:54:27.17 moment was in that Alleyway just looking left and looking right and it smelled

00:54:32.02 just as good in both directions and I can't even put into words the smell of

00:54:36.17 this is like Old World mixed with waffle

00:54:39.02 mixed with whatever the [ __ ] else is in Belgium it was like it was it was I

00:54:44.17 would fly there again just to go to that Alleyway I feel like my heart could

00:54:48.06 smell it yeah yeah you won't even smell it with your nose right you responded

00:54:52.08 with your you were smelling it with your spirit yeah.

00:54:58.02 I would I would go to the next town over oh to smell that Alleyway I'm not

00:55:03.03 leaving my Province or state but I would go one town over for that that sounds

00:55:08.10 pretty good but whatever you're also a person who doesn't like going downstairs

00:55:12.22 so I feel like that's pretty good well no no no not necessarily I'm open to it

00:55:18.19 I just need an experience that moves me that sounds moving I could go there

00:55:22.19 once the stairs also you're you're like creating an additional hurdle once I get

00:55:28.02 past the stairs I'm willing to go wherever it's just this is me to go

00:55:32.02 through the stair no I'll go I'll go way

00:55:34.11 beyond that but what got it changed what I had never considered and this is what

00:55:38.10 was so [ __ ] funny I don't remember what it was called but Eric was showing

00:55:43.19 Geoff what these it was like a type of long dog it was a dog breed that is so

00:55:48.02 weird especially Eric loves those the he's a big fan of the long dogs and it

00:55:53.18 turned into a conversation of like what if your point of reference for Animals

00:55:58.21 was was very simplistic and being like seeing a giraffe and being like you

00:56:02.13 would not believe the [ __ ] dog I saw.

00:56:06.03 I would travel the globe if somebody described to me an animal that they

00:56:10.22 encountered that I could see if they were like you will not believe this

00:56:14.15 [ __ ] horse and it's a giraffe I'm all in about that that moves me that yeah

00:56:18.19 that's wherever for that that's what it was Eric just tried to describe like how

00:56:22.08 to describe an elephant to somebody who's never heard of or seen an elephant

00:56:26.10 before you're like no trust me it's as big as a house it's as big and it's nose

00:56:30.14 touches the ground and its ears its ears are like its ears are the size of three

00:56:35.13 men standing next to each other and you'll be like you're [ __ ] crazy that

00:56:40.15 doesn't exist Andrew how far would you travel for to see a chair there's an

00:56:46.01 animal that looked exactly like a wooden chair imagine like the first the

00:56:49.22 cheapest chair in The Sims but it was like a sentient creature how would you

00:56:55.00 how far would you go to see that walking around I'm eating oh I'm we're

00:57:00.02 going on about I don't care I'm getting on a boat for that I will go

00:57:04.11 to a different part of the world to see the chair animal 100 percent

00:57:09.13 I will be so mad the entire time I'm on the boat I'll be like Jim better not

00:57:13.13 have [ __ ] lied about what they're saying is I'm gonna be so goddamn mad I

00:57:18.17 make it to Ireland and there's no goddamn chair animals well I think that

00:57:23.02 the fear we had on that office Day morning that what we were creating was

00:57:27.17 content uh was founded because this was clearly content uh about I would you say

00:57:33.00 like a half an hour into the thing we decided just to record uh what we were

00:57:38.07 talking about and and kind of in the spirit of uh Eric's Eric Eric's job

00:57:43.07 supplement yeah that we made where it was just Eric trying to schedule us for

00:57:47.21 26 minutes so we recorded about an hour and 15 minutes of us just like office

00:57:52.03 talk and uh we called it uh we decided that like this is either gonna be

00:57:56.08 episode the next episode of [ __ ] face or

00:57:58.09 it's gonna be its own show uh I think it was different enough to be its own show

00:58:03.14 but yeah we uh we described it as like a pier behind the veil or like

00:58:06.23 getting to see how the sausage is made and then Gavin didn't understand that

00:58:11.01 reference so it became sausage talk and so I think we've got a new show

00:58:16.08 coming out at some point called sausage talk that's just us talking about like I

00:58:20.09 guess the behind the scenes [ __ ] yeah it's it's a weird thing because I don't

00:58:26.04 think it was necessarily all that funny but I think it's an interesting insight

00:58:30.21 into it's also the very first production

00:58:33.14 meeting we've ever had for face anything yes it's kind of fun that that was

00:58:37.18 recorded we didn't want it to be an episode of Face just because we got the

00:58:41.00 disadvantage of we're all in the same room except for Andrew yeah I remember

00:58:44.12 going home from that and remembering the

00:58:46.11 name sausage talk and I was trying I was trying to remember the phrase that it

00:58:50.05 came from because I kept forgetting it and I was like what was it this is like

00:58:53.13 peek behind the sausage

00:58:56.17 like you have to move a sausage

00:59:01.23 uh so anyway I don't know when it's coming out it may already be out uh

00:59:06.23 maybe out before this episode yeah but there is supplemental content either

00:59:10.21 that just hit or that's coming called sausage talk I guess we'll record one

00:59:15.05 every office day so once a month so that'll be 12 of those a year unless

00:59:20.01 we're using office day for something like the pizza video or or hitting

00:59:24.07 baseballs or or like or MVP which is coming I think next week actually oh no

00:59:28.17 it's not because nope yeah what was meant to be it was meant to be tomorrow

00:59:33.14 but then we realized that big Uno stream is tomorrow yeah yeah

00:59:38.10 uh so uh also uh we promised uh at some point in in space that y'all would do a

00:59:43.15 like your recap of your experience of survive Block Island together and so

00:59:48.13 after we filmed sausage talk episode one volume one year one we filmed uh that

00:59:54.10 and I I'll say no more about that other than it was I think it went about 45

00:59:58.17 minutes was that interesting at all because I felt very in my own head about

01:00:02.18 that I wasn't sure if I was clear at all

01:00:04.22 I thought I think she convoluted that no no I think it is and I think Eric felt

01:00:08.05 it was very interesting and I think because I asked him the same question uh

01:00:11.15 because you and I like the three of us were like involved in the production so

01:00:15.10 we were pretty in the weeds with it and you it's kind of hard to sell seductive

01:00:19.22 sometimes we were pretty we were deep in the sausage we were we were we were

01:00:23.14 knee-deep in the sausage weeds and uh Eric assured me that it was pretty good

01:00:27.05 I I do think that we wrapped it up at about the right time I do feel like it

01:00:30.11 it if it had gone on much longer it would have it would have started to drag

01:00:33.14 I feel like it is one of the few things we've made as this face team where it

01:00:39.06 wouldn't stand alone as a piece of content like you actually need to have

01:00:44.15 seen survive Block Island I think and if you listen to it every every second of

01:00:48.17 that series will be spoiled so make sure you watch it first if you have any

01:00:52.06 interest in watching it yeah I only have one regret from that recording there's

01:00:55.11 one thing I I should have brought up that I I completely forgot about but

01:00:59.19 maybe we'll talk about that later talk about it next sausage you could do

01:01:03.21 an add-on a little pickup nah I don't think it's worth it's like a weird it's

01:01:08.08 weird that we didn't mention it but not worth it being an add-on I'll talk to

01:01:11.20 you about it after we record all right all right uh speaking of should we stop

01:01:16.13 yeah I guess we should wrap up this is fun this is a really relaxed nice hour

01:01:21.01 it was really great catching up with the two of you Eric got off lightly by not

01:01:25.20 being here because uh unfortunately extra medium was gonna come up again

01:01:31.08 based on some stuff I've read in the comments of this podcast so thanks to

01:01:35.20 all the comment levers who have filled me in over something he was

01:01:40.08 saying on face jam and we will be taking that up with him

01:01:43.02 I have dude I'm excited because I have no idea what it is but I do know that

01:01:48.23 Eric is [ __ ] over the extra medium talk which only only makes me want to

01:01:53.23 dive deeper into it so good and uh I guess this will be the

01:01:57.04 last one of these we record for because we're not doing next week right but

01:02:00.23 we'll do the following week yeah I believe that's correct too I imagine I

01:02:06.14 assume so uh love you both dearly uh Gavin have a fantastic vacation Andrew

01:02:12.06 uh I hope you uh don't have to travel as far as four blocks if you don't want to

01:02:17.20 and uh we'll see you guys uh next time on face

01:02:21.21 bye that felt weird the buy felt weird that was a weird shot that was a weird

01:02:26.19 bite Gavin typically goes by and then I think to myself I should say bye but I

01:02:31.05 never say anything you said I was trying as if you would you were just sitting

01:02:35.02 down in a lounger it's very guttural to me it was like it was it was low it was

01:02:40.12 gotta roll you're right it's like I'm gonna just shut up it's like

01:02:44.21 what that buy was your dad goes to work all day long he works in a factory he

01:02:49.19 comes home he's no [ __ ] fun at the end of the day he sits down he's eating

01:02:53.12 his dinner and you're and your mom is like I'm gonna go play Bingo or with my

01:02:58.07 friends and he's like bye and he like raises him like I don't give a [ __ ] get

01:03:01.18 out I'm so [ __ ] done with these people and this yeah I would apply that

01:03:05.19 to someone like uh remember Geoff when we would record an entire let's play and

01:03:08.19 then the pile go out and we'd lose every single piece and then we'd have to sit

01:03:12.13 down again to record it immediately it was it was a buy from that sort of

01:03:16.21 mindset yeah should I try it again can I try to do different a proper Gavin buy

01:03:21.08 yeah let's have a recipe in the moment Redemption why are you making this about

01:03:24.23 me because you have a very distinctive buy I'm gonna I'm gonna try to hit it

01:03:28.05 okay by the way you're very self-conscious this episode buddy

01:03:33.00 well you stepped over Gavin's laugh try it again

01:03:38.07 a little loud what is that gonna be on his thoughts of Discord I'm only hearing

01:03:42.12 I yeah you're cut you get the beginning he's getting cut off okay so I'm gonna

01:03:45.20 talk a little bit and I'm gonna immediately trip bye

01:03:50.02 that sounds like that is like you're crossing the road and a car has like

01:03:54.22 come up the curve a little bit and you're like

01:03:58.02 and they're going very fast and all you can hear is bye I give up I Surrender

01:04:04.04 oh goodbye stop dude don't do it that way it's weird

01:04:10.09 it's creeping me out bye bye bye now that was a weird one really who's now
