00:00:09.13 [Music]

00:00:15.07 I guess I should say I got the bread put

00:00:18.20 the work and now I've lost the breakfast it's very small

00:00:22.19 it's a very small thing I keep losing it I got it to

00:00:27.05 no I didn't throw it away air cast did I throw it away I didn't throw it away I

00:00:32.06 tightly wound up a bag that had two bagels in it

00:00:36.01 and I was like this could hold it and I got it to the point where it did

00:00:41.01 prevent it from opening the bag then I took a bagel out and I put on my desk

00:00:45.12 and then I moved it somewhere from that I don't it's somewhere on my desk I

00:00:48.13 think but it's very small you bend it didn't you it's tough to find I

00:00:52.11 definitely did not bin it well I've got the bread clip here what

00:00:55.20 episode is this by the way all right hold on second I'll do that hello and

00:00:59.23 welcome to the 110th episode of the F**kFuckFacePodcast my name is Geoff Ramsey with

00:01:05.05 me as always Andrew panton and Gavin free

00:01:10.02 uh ones from england one's from Canada doesn't matter which uh I'm from america

00:01:15.06 and Gavin you're gonna try and experiment I think I was supposed to do

00:01:18.21 this in 108 and I forgot but uh I now have the bread clip and some bread so

00:01:23.17 how did first off how does it feel like let's give it give it give us some uh

00:01:27.08 some audio texture how does it feel in your hand what is it sturdy do you like

00:01:31.07 the magnet well the first thing I've noticed is that it's made of metal but

00:01:34.22 that bit isn't magnetic it has a separate magnet on it it's got a little

00:01:39.14 magnet on it sort of defeats the whole purpose in a

00:01:43.05 way but all right uh got some bread I'm gonna try it now because in my head

00:01:47.06 this was this there's no way I wasn't gonna get this on here but here we go

00:01:50.19 let's try yeah I know I was the same and then I got a loaf and it's really

00:01:54.00 difficult you need to really wind it tight you need to make the top narrow

00:01:57.16 and you need to slide it up there's no putting it through the front you got to

00:02:02.15 slide it in the hole it's a slide mechanism

00:02:06.21 oh wait is it a full loaf of bread that you're trying to do how much bread is in

00:02:10.21 this bag I'm just go I'm not using the bread bit yeah you're just using the bag

00:02:16.02 what do you mean what is it just an empty bag no it's got like the nubs on

00:02:21.06 the end you just wait that's what I'm asking I'm asking

00:02:25.05 how much of the loaf is in the bag probably why does it matter I'm not

00:02:29.16 because it's a weight for the neck it's a weight differential for the bag

00:02:34.06 and the maneuverability of it has a full loaf you don't have the same

00:02:37.20 maneuverability in the back I've done this before have you done this Geoff have

00:02:41.09 you tried this yes okay well I didn't know that okay I tried it first

00:02:45.22 oh I don't even remember that but I the bagels work because there was less

00:02:50.17 volume I'd say in the bag itself that allowed more manipulation and flattening

00:02:56.06 of the bag to get it through this blows yeah

00:03:00.10 listen it's a prototype it's early it's version one things that we solved a it's

00:03:05.18 pretty it's very aesthetic it's got a pr it's a it's a it's a it's a beautiful

00:03:09.02 sky blue it's got cool uh date on it says our name that's cool nailed it out

00:03:14.12 of the park first try right there got it it's got a magnet on it sticks to metal

00:03:21.05 stuff boom nailed that feels sturdy nailed it doesn't bend

00:03:25.04 absolutely nailed that unfortunately that's where it starts to fall apart

00:03:29.07 turns out should have bent a little bit no worries we'll work on that for

00:03:33.16 revision two what you have right now though in version one is a great

00:03:37.14 commemorative bl red clip much like when people buy commemorative spoons and

00:03:42.12 thimbles they don't really use them to sew and eat soup they hang them on the

00:03:46.14 wall god my mouth I just [ __ ] this you're struggling yeah it's just like I

00:03:52.08 feel like my mouth's full of saliva all the time okay so I I ripped the bag and

00:03:57.22 the the magnet flew off and um the megan's gone now I've just got the uh

00:04:02.06 the blue bit it's tough it's yeah I think I'm gonna put I'm gonna put on a

00:04:05.09 chain and wear it I think that's how I'm

00:04:07.22 gonna use it well I think what you could do honestly you put it on a chain and

00:04:11.03 then you have like a singular bagel in a bag and you run that through the hole

00:04:14.15 and then you have the bag supporting the bag so it's like a double chain

00:04:18.04 situation that would be the luck have like one slice of bread and a bag being

00:04:23.11 held up by your chin just in case you never know when you could use a slice

00:04:28.06 or a bag man I wonder how many of these we bought I

00:04:30.18 have no idea how many the store has people buying it I don't think you know

00:04:34.00 they'll buy it yet yeah I mean they probably are

00:04:37.04 they're definitely out by the time people hear this but not not when we're

00:04:40.21 recording this can I can I give an important update I

00:04:44.05 meant to give last time that is right it is genuine the joy doesn't end it just

00:04:49.22 keeps on going with the whole Jake tombs Thomas thing yeah so I recorded a thing

00:04:54.13 and I need to like edit it down and chop it a little bit of him learning because

00:04:58.10 after we recorded I talked to him in a group and he he learned that he's been

00:05:03.04 saying tom's wrong his entire life and he was not happy about it and it was a

00:05:07.02 big discussion of like we are sacrificing the fact that we can hear

00:05:12.04 him say tombs and it is [ __ ]

00:05:14.08 hilarious every time he says it um so there's sort of a sense of loss

00:05:18.00 the fact that we we had lost tombs I'm I'm not exaggerating the exact same

00:05:22.11 night he was we're talking he's like you know

00:05:25.02 what's funny is I don't even typically use like toms that type of thing I'm

00:05:29.02 more like I'm in the role aids camp you know roll aids like the watch

00:05:33.13 and there was a pause that's a long silent pause and you're

00:05:37.16 like excuse me he said rolaid's like the watch and we're we're like is that on

00:05:43.07 the packaging didn't you come up with that

00:05:46.02 and he said no this is uh it's a Jake original for you and he genuinely we

00:05:51.12 lost toms and tombs Jake thinks Rolexes are called rolaids and it's been the new

00:05:55.12 thing that has taken the last week he went to a wedding and I was like oh you

00:05:59.14 see anybody open any gifts and he's like

00:06:01.22 nah I didn't see it I was like oh so you didn't see anyone get a roll aid and he

00:06:05.22 said nope didn't see it I was like does your dad have a relay Jake he's like I

00:06:10.19 don't know he might I'm not sure he genuinely thinks this so it's it's just

00:06:14.19 an endless treasure cove of of words that are slightly wrong I mean at least

00:06:20.23 with tombs you could have just misread the word yeah how do you get roll aid I

00:06:25.05 have no idea and I'm not he's not doing a bit he just genuinely thinks that role

00:06:30.21 aids is rolex and it's great it's been getting him and

00:06:35.05 it's so much easier to prompt him to do the rolaid rolex thing it's fantastic

00:06:40.15 I'll Gavin dispose to the photo that looks ridiculous that looks good I think

00:06:44.19 that looks good I like that I think that's I think that's going on that's

00:06:49.06 flashing right there I'm a chain guy what is the thing on your is that the

00:06:53.12 skateboard from tony hawk ride what is that thing on your floor is that oh it's

00:06:57.22 just something to no it's just something to stand on like a little rocker when

00:07:01.14 the desk is in stand mode what you have a thing you have a thing

00:07:06.13 to stand on when it you're standing for your desk

00:07:09.18 yeah it just came with a desk I don't know why I don't know if it's good for

00:07:13.22 you or anything oh I just stand on it and it's like a you balance I don't know

00:07:18.12 I feel like that defeats the purpose of the standing I'm still standing I'm just

00:07:22.01 standing on something that's not the floor yeah but I feel like the whole

00:07:25.04 thing of you stand because you don't want to sit and you're you're like

00:07:28.10 avoiding a mechanism it would defeat the

00:07:30.09 purpose of the standing desk if I raised it as high as it could go and then sat

00:07:34.00 in a lifeguard chair I think that would be pointless but I think this is tough

00:07:37.22 you're just getting a good view you're making sure nobody's sneaking up on you

00:07:42.00 no snake is going to get you in the life

00:07:44.19 that's a real throwback it is are you gonna wear that like is that is

00:07:49.07 this genuinely part of your wardrobe now can people I mean I'm wearing it now I

00:07:54.15 don't know how long it'll stay on I typically find it really annoying to wear

00:07:58.04 jewelry even watches is annoying what is there any exception to your

00:08:02.14 jewelry I mean I'd wear a roll age but that's about it yeah roll aid

00:08:06.15 I looked I googled to see if there's maybe a like a commemorative rolaid's

00:08:09.16 watch or something they never made that it doesn't matter it's tragic oh I'd

00:08:14.02 love to to get Jake a roll aids watch did you see what papa john's did Eric

00:08:19.19 Gavin I was gonna say I'm so used to talking like dumb food [ __ ] with Eric I

00:08:25.11 instinctually said somebody sent this to me right before

00:08:30.08 he recorded it's a [ __ ] monstrosity maybe you'll defend it

00:08:34.03 I [ __ ] hate it papa john's is doing a branston pickling cheese stuffed crust

00:08:39.07 no in the us ah no I'm assuming this is in in Europe

00:08:43.14 in the [ __ ] you think in the us do you think they're [ __ ] brave enough

00:08:49.03 to do that in the us also I need to clarify is papa john's in

00:08:53.13 Europe or is it just coincidentally another pizza chain named papa john's

00:08:57.22 that has nothing to do after Dennis the menace I don't know what to believe is

00:09:03.09 that the same logo not really dude bransta's been around for a hundred

00:09:08.23 years look has it well it says since 2019-22

00:09:13.05 [ __ ] gross that's terrible is it to celebrate the 100th of the century of

00:09:18.00 Branson pickle I love the idea that papa john was the

00:09:21.11 one that was like we need to I need to eat this that sounds

00:09:26.12 absolutely phenomenal I would horrible wow papa john's is everywhere

00:09:32.06 that doesn't surprise me isn't is Shaq papa john now because papa john's sucked

00:09:37.20 and he got kicked out of poppy Johnson yeah I think he's on the board or

00:09:41.01 something right he's like a bunch of chain restaurants I

00:09:44.10 believe of theirs yeah he's a savvy businessman Shaquille O'neal I've

00:09:48.22 never looked at a crust and thought this needs pickle like it's just such a

00:09:54.10 terrible look it's not pickle it's [ __ ] onion right no it's isn't it

00:09:58.14 pickle I mean I've uh it's like mainly pickled onion well I mean you read the

00:10:01.21 ingredients it was like a bunch of different stuff I don't even remember I

00:10:05.00 just remembered not liking it I think we should get we should try and get you

00:10:08.04 some of that and I want some too Howard I don't think there's any way to get I

00:10:11.16 assume it's only in Europe well let's Google I mean pizza travels well but I

00:10:17.05 don't know if it travels that well we need someone to just take you on a plane

00:10:22.04 illegally you know like in movies where like they tape the drugs or the money to

00:10:27.16 them for like walking across it's just pizza boxes

00:10:30.01 yeah why are available they also make Branson pickle cheese sticks oh I'm just

00:10:34.00 imagining somebody walking through the airport looking like a [ __ ] roblox

00:10:37.11 character with like the boxes on each corner of them just a big blocky try to

00:10:42.00 be stealthy what's this limited edition cheese sticks

00:10:46.00 that's the same thing yeah it looks like it's only in the uk

00:10:50.04 it's terrible I'm gonna have to make a trip yeah terrible anyone want to come

00:10:55.16 no well no I thought for any reason no the answer

00:10:59.05 is no you will not set foot in the united kingdom until

00:11:03.17 uh until after November there's an order there's a wait list

00:11:08.00 I didn't go to Vegas that was all I was just kidding as a joke

00:11:12.16 I'm not in Vegas right now remember that he's gonna be in Vegas that was a whole

00:11:18.15 big hole he ha just kidding oh man I can't believe you

00:11:22.05 wouldn't go to england with me uh I went after November I think that's

00:11:27.09 pretty clear so if an opportunity came up after the

00:11:30.21 after the Princeton pickle and cheese once it's long gone I'll I'll gladly

00:11:35.02 gladly get do an england trip with you I

00:11:36.23 just don't want to set foot well I don't want to be in the same place that there

00:11:40.20 is a pickled crust sounds dangerous we could make how do you make a

00:11:45.05 yeah we can make this no we can't no we can't no we can't we can't and we don't

00:11:51.15 want to we could we could it's possible how do we make this have

00:11:56.00 you ever made a crust in your life no I assume it's just rolling cheese into it

00:12:01.09 right yeah okay folding some cheese in I guarantee you

00:12:05.07 we could make this and it'd be perfect for face cooks the food the cookbook

00:12:11.01 that we have never made the spirit we'll need is someone in england if this is

00:12:15.03 still on someone just to rip the crust open and just give me a reference photo

00:12:19.04 and then I'll try and make it that's a great idea I'd love to see that I want

00:12:22.19 to see your interpretation of it and then I would I would go to Austin to eat

00:12:26.22 it well oh my god Gavin Gavin this is the pizza you can cook in my pizza oven

00:12:32.04 in my backyard so I've been demoing it sit oh it's just a circle oh my god

00:12:36.03 thank Christ this weekend Emily was like is Gavin gonna make a [ __ ] pizza or

00:12:39.10 what and I was like I don't know I don't think so she goes I'm paying to have

00:12:44.06 this thing torn down like tomorrow pizza all right so that's it after you

00:12:49.15 make the branston pickle stuffed crust pizza we're ripping that thing down so

00:12:54.02 we can put a pool in just like pulling the pizza out and then the

00:12:58.10 sledgehammers immediately start

00:13:03.01 oh that's perfect I think you should keep that but I'm not gonna though but

00:13:07.18 that's perfect dude that's super exciting in three years I've made zero

00:13:11.12 pizzas since we made that we since we had the discussion in my backyard of you

00:13:16.06 making a pizza in that thing we've made zero pizzas

00:13:20.15 it clearly doesn't get used however however

00:13:22.21 this is a pro this is a perfect way to use it I could not be more excited I

00:13:26.19 would argue that you can go to a place to swim you can't go to a place to make

00:13:30.12 a pizza I think the pizza oven is significantly more valuable an authentic

00:13:34.16 pizza of an experience obviously every people have ovens ovens can work but I'm

00:13:39.09 saying like an authentic pizza oven experience

00:13:42.08 you can't just walk up and use that I mean I could just go to there's like

00:13:47.18 five wood-fired oven pizza restaurants are like a five blocks from me yeah but

00:13:52.01 you're not used to what's it in the way of though what's it in the way of

00:13:55.19 yeah it takes up a lot of [ __ ] space what are you gonna put there like a

00:14:00.04 chair you've got chairs I'm gonna put a pool there

00:14:02.14 right there where the pizza thing is part of it yeah but the pool will cut

00:14:05.14 into it a little bit yeah probably I would rework the shape of the pool also

00:14:09.18 we [ __ ] tried to dig in your backyard before we know what it's like you're not

00:14:13.06 gonna dig a pool there you get three feet there's no [ __ ] way I like that

00:14:18.01 Andrew throws himself in this we tried to dig a hole but we are not gonna be

00:14:22.17 digging a pool the pro a dude with a crane is gonna dig

00:14:25.14 and a [ __ ] earth mover is gonna be digging the pool hole it's not gonna be

00:14:29.05 us with shovels out there you're gonna get a four foot pool and one foot of it

00:14:32.15 will be below ground the rest will be sticking out that's a lot

00:14:36.13 if also if you get a [ __ ] crane to dig up your yard you better [ __ ] try

00:14:41.13 to cook beans in that hole you better make a real goddamn hole with that

00:14:45.01 beanie I don't want any goddamn excuses a Gavin with a hammer also

00:14:49.13 I don't think we ever released that video I don't know if we ever will but

00:14:53.05 what a [ __ ] this may be my favorite video that has ever come out of the show

00:14:56.10 that baseballs what's that the bean hole yeah I don't think the bean hole video

00:14:59.12 ever got released I could be wrong it's never because you're serious no it's

00:15:02.12 never come out I put I put them in the folder like two months ago really I was

00:15:06.08 like hey I've got these videos done let me know if you want any changes wait

00:15:09.17 because the full baseball video never came out either yet did you do that as

00:15:13.08 well oh no it didn't why do I do it why do I do it wait wait wait wait wait

00:15:15.05 they're available I've been waiting I've been waiting for you to be done yeah me

00:15:18.20 too I didn't know they were playing this slack ages ago I've never seen any of

00:15:22.11 them I'd love to gavin's overkill achievement came out and then before

00:15:26.05 that it was Geoff at the plate reel and then Geoff at the plate they were my dick

00:15:30.02 off on those I'm so excited to see them you didn't tell anyone this is gonna be

00:15:34.08 really exciting we're gonna find oh they were out are you serious I put them in

00:15:39.12 the slack you idiots oh did you put them

00:15:41.10 there's no way you put them in the slack.

00:15:44.00 I don't remember you saying these are done like I went to the Google drive

00:15:48.23 folder and I was like uh this one needs music anyone got any notes no I didn't

00:15:54.15 what are you talking about is that you saying this is done or

00:15:59.12 yeah like watch the thing I've edited it where is it I'd love to see it

00:16:03.15 you're a fool you're a bunch of people I don't if it was just

00:16:07.18 three different edits out the door in the same way no one's even watching I'll

00:16:11.03 be honest I was under the impression you just got too busy to deal with it you

00:16:14.16 had you had slow-mo guys stuff and that you just like forgot about it and I was

00:16:19.03 like it's not a big deal like we already

00:16:21.07 got content out of it so I was like it's

00:16:24.00 no big deal now it's a really odd amount of time I wish you would I wish I would

00:16:27.02 have what put it in the slack well I don't know that you did I'd really roll up

00:16:32.19 where to where maybe it was when I maybe it was one of

00:16:36.23 the times I quit Facebook where is it Eric where'd you get that

00:16:40.01 well I searched you said any notes on baseballs I think it should probably

00:16:44.10 have some background music and then you didn't and then that was and that was it

00:16:49.22 sorry do I need to do more than that I I said does anyone have any notes on

00:16:53.04 baseballs silence and then nothing why did I bother right but I didn't know it

00:16:58.12 was done what she wanted to be very much trying

00:17:01.18 to say this is done when when was that posted uh like may 3rd oh god

00:17:07.20 I this is a weird now I know you're annoyed and you have

00:17:11.14 every right to be we all missed it because we thought we were being

00:17:16.04 courteous to you this was miss with the best intent I thought you were just

00:17:20.07 super busy I thought you were super busy and that you just hadn't gotten around

00:17:23.12 to it and I wasn't going to be like where the [ __ ] are these videos that you

00:17:26.20 said you would do like I was just like so no one's bugging me about it because

00:17:30.20 you think I'm busy I've already posted them and I'm thinking oh I guess nobody

00:17:35.00 I guess they've gone up or nobody had any notes we're being respectful of your

00:17:39.06 time I I will say I can't find I'm looking and I can't find the bean hole

00:17:44.03 one completed but I don't know if that was completed or not again if it was

00:17:48.08 done is that not in the same photo I'm I

00:17:50.06 don't I just have the direct link to the video I don't have the link to the

00:17:53.12 folder yeah it's just a link to a base maybe that might be on you that part

00:17:56.21 that one might be on me I mean they're both in there

00:17:59.15 okay but again I don't have I'm not sure like I don't have the folder

00:18:04.23 okay so I've messed up that one I I assume

00:18:38.00 Facebook unknowingly the [ __ ] we're opening the Facebook

00:18:44.13 this podcast is such a piece of [ __ ] no we need more we need money and people

00:18:49.16 and it doesn't work without it here's what I'll say uh no one from the

00:18:54.12 audience has asked about these videos so they may not even want them no they

00:18:58.21 definitely I want I feel like I want them I feel like I haven't seen anything

00:19:02.08 about them I just assume they came out and everyone was like oh

00:19:05.23 can I how do I see the how do I see the bean hole yeah where's the bean hole

00:19:09.12 video I'm not locked in on this I have to send you though because I can't do it

00:19:12.18 yeah because I can't afford I can't like back out of this video and yeah like up

00:19:16.13 there no it's just asking me how else I want to open this so yeah okay I'm so

00:19:21.16 happy I'm taking the blame on bean hall but uh I I did put baseballs up over two

00:19:26.06 but you put baseballs up finished it's done I just I wanted to

00:19:30.04 know if you think I should have music on it but I didn't know it was done you're

00:19:33.18 asking for notes we didn't give notes but you didn't say okay never mind then

00:19:37.03 it's done I have to say okay I have to say uh I I

00:19:40.15 need notes by the way it's done what do you mean that's that means what do I

00:19:44.08 mean you asked for notes and then didn't say anything else about it ever so I

00:19:48.08 didn't sorry I asked for notes I'll say something immediately after what

00:19:54.08 Gavin we gave you a month to let us know it was done and you just never kind of

00:20:00.05 got back around to it man I want it on the record Gavin I'm on your side on

00:20:05.00 this I'm with you I just missed it

00:20:08.15 was there I somehow missed that message I I don't want to be on either side but

00:20:14.12 I will say uh I I think that Eric brings up a point if you present it as does

00:20:19.04 this need background music it probably does do you think he could throw some in

00:20:23.09 it sounds like it's not done can you paste what I wrote Eric uh

00:20:29.00 yes it is right here this is from okay so this is from Wednesday may the 4th

00:20:34.00 and it is uh can you believe the can you bleep the faces too while you're at it

00:20:39.07 oh oh video so I still so it's not done he's giving it seems like it's done

00:20:44.07 this was uh uh Gavin posted a link to the Google drive

00:20:47.20 where baseballs lives on which any notes excuse me

00:20:51.14 any notes on baseballs I think it should probably have some background music and

00:20:57.16 I still need to bleep the faces that there's no indication that this is

00:21:03.09 complete it's in I'm just doing finishing touches stuff any notes before

00:21:06.21 I export it for the final time so we don't have the funnel so we don't

00:21:10.05 have the final export is what you're telling me why would you have the final

00:21:13.22 why would you give notes on the one that's being uploaded what are you

00:21:17.14 talking about oh I'm just saying we don't have it I'm

00:21:20.20 not saying you know where it lives or whatever so where is the final version

00:21:25.01 yeah because I don't have that I've never how do we get access to the final

00:21:28.17 version I'm sorry I thought this was a collaborative process I thought that if

00:21:32.12 you wanted changes or if suddenly Geoff was like oh it shouldn't be this long I

00:21:36.12 thought I'd probably still cut it down before I waste time timing it to music

00:21:41.06 bleeping words that aren't going to be in it I thought maybe that was a good

00:21:46.08 time to get some feedback I apologize I was clearly wrong let's let it just sit

00:21:50.04 there no no no no for six weeks and I'll

00:21:53.11 just shut I'll just shove both thumbs up my ass how about that

00:21:57.07 I need to be I genuinely am so sad I didn't see that I'm really sorry I

00:22:00.16 missed it because I would have loved I would have given any note I would have

00:22:03.19 given so many notes I would have been the nerdiest note person of all time if

00:22:07.17 I saw that video dude I'm so sad I missed I'll be honest it's a very Geoff

00:22:11.13 move to uh look at a video that's been uploaded and be like wow why is that 16

00:22:15.21 minutes it should have been four I absol now I will say I absolutely agree with

00:22:21.01 you on that yes what did I have standards

00:22:24.11 you have standards after it's done you don't have time before it's done

00:22:30.19 if I listen okay I very rarely I very rarely have time to give notes

00:22:36.08 uh and I trust you guys until after where you're more than happy to what are

00:22:41.17 you talking about when am I doing that we need to factor in how contentious

00:22:45.16 baseballs was for a time Geoff almost quit this podcast because we posted a

00:22:50.19 photo of him missing baseballs it was very close

00:22:53.10 yeah at least at least uh even though this one didn't come out the other three

00:22:57.04 about baseballs came out so I think I'm so excited to watch this I'll be honest

00:23:01.03 with you gav it totally sounds like we dropped the ball on responding to you in

00:23:05.02 all seriousness we should have either said no it's good to go go for it or I

00:23:08.04 don't have time to I'm not going to watch this I can't be bothered export it

00:23:12.19 or what whatever response you got no response so that is on us but but in our

00:23:18.02 defense I will say there were 3000

00:23:20.10 [ __ ] baseball videos all at once and I just missed this one but I saw all the

00:23:24.04 other ones it's the one that took like seven hours to edit um so sorry that's

00:23:27.13 all right that's right I don't to be honest I don't know why I thought it

00:23:30.12 would have went up I clearly hadn't bleeped

00:23:33.20 honestly just the silence of it I just thought oh something's happened with it

00:23:37.09 I thought there's no way it just sat there in the slack unattended I'm so

00:23:42.06 glad we decided to record two of these today I know like how long this could

00:23:45.20 have went I'm so excited to watch the bean hole video I cannot wait yeah I've

00:23:51.09 never seen it I can't wait to get the link to it

00:23:53.21 yeah I would say a little a little appear behind the veil for the audience

00:23:57.04 there was a discussion we recorded 109

00:23:59.13 and 110 back to back today because Eric and I have to go out of town for vidcon

00:24:02.23 next week and uh so there was some discussion

00:24:06.03 about whether we had enough material for a second episode today and I think we

00:24:09.17 were all kind of on the fence on it if we had decided not to do this it might

00:24:14.01 have been another six months before we found out about these videos

00:24:20.06 when we did the second like the next set of baseballs that probably would have

00:24:24.18 come up again I'm like oh it's too bad that we never got that video this it

00:24:28.13 could be weeks yeah yeah yeah talking about the

00:24:32.08 immense pizza oven follow-up to a video that didn't come out

00:24:36.06 that's true nobody's ever seen the well I audience I apologize in one of the

00:24:41.05 videos we have a whole conversation about how gavin's going to cook a pizza

00:24:44.21 in my pizza oven I guess you have Geoff you need to you

00:24:47.09 need to save part of your destroyed pizza oven for the museum

00:24:51.05 because it's hard to floor if cooks the pizza

00:24:54.00 you got to save a chunk of it yeah it's very important to that

00:24:58.02 it's a pizza wall gather how are you doing man I just remember how busy

00:25:02.03 April and me were I'm trying to squeeze those in for no reason hey real real

00:25:06.17 fast camera real fast can I ask you a question

00:25:10.19 which socks are you wearing today [Laughter]

00:25:14.02 I'm wearing the old style oh okay

00:25:20.06 that is funny oh that's actually I'm not even mad like I'm not even mad

00:25:26.19 because it became content on this one but that is mind-blowing

00:25:31.09 do you know why it happened honestly it wasn't like it was sent to one person it

00:25:36.13 was to the there's like 10 people in that slack

00:25:39.23 it had it happened because we have so many things going on all the time like

00:25:45.05 faces just was like it's just like a minefield of bad of

00:25:48.19 bits that we're dancing around it's like we were probably seven bits further by

00:25:52.17 the time that you know what I mean it's like it's it's unfortunate

00:25:57.16 but it's so awesome that we found out and we get to release these videos now

00:26:02.21 doesn't mean we need to no no we need the audience no we do that's the one we

00:26:07.12 do I don't think the audience knew they were missing them we talked about

00:26:12.19 did we talk about how there were so many baseball videos coming out and I've got

00:26:16.12 like my super cut coming I don't think anyone cared no I care I think they've

00:26:20.23 probably been anticipating this for weeks they probably just saw the two

00:26:24.02 baseball videos that were already out and thought that that's what you meant

00:26:28.23 oh I'm so excited then we're putting out stuff like the overkill and oh god

00:26:34.08 we'll talk about we'll get about yeah I can't wait man I wish I could I wish I

00:26:40.00 wish I I wish I had that mechanism internally

00:26:43.18 that allowed me to feel empathy for you in this moment because I think I would

00:26:49.01 like I can see you I can see why I would I don't um clearly

00:26:53.09 but I would I I kind of wish I did I wish I felt bad for you right now

00:26:56.12 because it seems like you're probably upset and I can imagine how annoying and

00:27:00.04 frustrating that would be if it was if it was week off

00:27:03.05 I I just like I've I guess I've forgotten mostly of how

00:27:06.10 how busy all that time was if it was closer to it I'd probably be more

00:27:11.22 annoyed I'm not annoyed it's funny it's a very us thing to have happened it is

00:30:16.15 it's so important to have methods that can help your mental health I know for

00:30:21.05 me when I'm working through something I found listening to music to be

00:30:25.01 incredibly helpful it allows me to be present while

00:30:27.11 comfortably processing things in a way that other media doesn't even though I

00:30:31.17 love movies and video games it's just a different experience I have when I'm

00:30:35.21 listening to music there's also better help online therapy

00:30:40.03 I've talked about it a lot but therapy is something that has made a real impact

00:30:43.07 in my life so it's always something I would highly recommend trying

00:30:47.04 better help offers a large variety of communication methods so you don't have

00:30:50.13 to see anyone on camera if you don't want to

00:30:53.08 it's much more affordable than in-person therapy and you can be matched with a

00:30:58.23 therapist within 48 hours our listeners get 10 off their first month at

00:31:13.01 hey I saw a comment the other day uh and I didn't write down who said it

00:31:18.10 unfortunately but uh somebody said that it was their uh suspicion that

00:31:23.18 future Gavin came back in time climbed a tree and threw the branch at

00:31:30.13 past Gavin and framed me so I have a question why is future Gavin trying to

00:31:35.22 frame current Geoff what does future you have against me because he [ __ ]

00:31:41.03 ignored his feedback on the baseball video is it because this is how it

00:31:44.23 starts it's this yeah if I'd have just heard and that's

00:31:48.12 for the baseballs after I got hit that would have been

00:31:53.05 yeah I wonder why I must have needed to move or maybe uh maybe I was about to

00:31:58.11 get sunburned or something maybe you were either saving your life but I don't

00:32:02.03 know why I'm getting the heat for it like it like it was me because I clearly

00:32:04.04 didn't do it I didn't think there's any way I could have known you would take

00:32:08.10 the heat for it though I mean you knew everything you're in the

00:32:11.18 future that's true does that mean it happened before this episode though or

00:32:17.01 after uh do you have the power to time travel currently that's a good point

00:32:22.00 yeah unless you just let something slip

00:32:25.01 that means okay so it's gonna have to be pretty soon though because I don't know

00:32:29.16 whether I'm gonna be able to climb trees for that much

00:32:34.02 I'm not gonna be coming back in my 70s and doing it am I

00:32:37.15 I was thinking about like old people things have you ever heard a

00:32:41.20 whippersnapper like unironically in the wild I don't think I've ever heard

00:32:46.15 really yeah I'd love to be called a whip per snap what was the context I mean

00:32:50.07 people used to dude I'm so old like I grew up in this like the late late 70s

00:32:55.02 and early 80s people said old people in

00:32:58.02 Alabama said [ __ ] like that all the time really sport and chief and champ and

00:33:02.15 whippersnapper yeah all that stuff oh it'd be great I'd love to I don't

00:33:07.07 think there's any I guess it's an insult I think if I was going to be called an

00:33:10.19 insult that's probably number one on my big board I don't think I've ever been

00:33:13.19 called a whipper and I don't think it's an insult I think it's more of like just

00:33:16.21 a terminology for like a rambunctious kid like whippersnapper yeah you little

00:33:20.13 but I feel like it's typically used in the context of I'm sick of this kid this

00:33:25.05 [ __ ]

00:33:26.08 I feel like negative connotation really interesting my perception of

00:33:30.12 whippersnapper is totally off is it is there an age limit when do you exceed

00:33:35.06 the line of whippersnapper uh when do you age out of whippersnapper but like

00:33:40.13 is that sooner than aging out of climbing trees I think

00:33:44.08 I was trying to figure out is it dependent on the person saying it or is

00:33:49.05 there a clear line like if they're a hundred does the bar move

00:33:53.09 because I would say if somebody who's like 70

00:33:57.12 they're probably maybe like 11 or 12 I'd assume is the cutoff if they're like a

00:34:02.13 hundred I feel like it would be appropriate for them to call like a 20

00:34:06.13 year old a whippersnapper I bet a hundred year old person has called a 70

00:34:11.04 year old a whippersnapper just probably think so I bet that's happened yeah I

00:34:14.21 think that's happened well I will say Andrew uh I think you

00:34:19.09 are more right than I was even that's not I don't ever remember being refer

00:34:24.12 used derogatorily but uh a dictionary kid

00:34:27.12 says that uh whippersnapper is a young impertinent and irritatingly over

00:34:32.13 confident person so I guess it is wow and negative

00:34:36.02 yeah well I always feel like these damn whipper snappers like the the kind I

00:34:39.19 guess I've only heard it ironically that's what I mean but even in the

00:34:42.19 ironic context I feel like it's aimed at somebody who's doing something against

00:34:46.07 the person saying it do you see that picture recently of the queen coming out

00:34:49.19 on her balcony stood next to prince Charles it's basically an old

00:34:53.15 woman stood next to an old man no but one's like her it's her kid but I bet

00:34:58.11 she could call him a whipper snapper I don't know if this is this is like a

00:35:03.01 not British dna thing I don't think I've ever just come across a photo of the

00:35:07.07 queen ever and it's never the me and seeing the queen never comes in the news

00:35:11.21 it was a big jubilee yeah it was the platinum jubilee I don't I don't know I

00:35:16.04 have no you don't know about the platinum jubilee

00:35:19.22 it I am aware of platinum games I don't know of platinum jubilee it's

00:35:25.01 the 70 this year was the 70th anniversary of her reign as monarch ah

00:35:30.01 that's right right Kevin I'm not getting I'm making this wrong yeah I mean not

00:35:34.05 complete respect to her you couldn't measure how insignificant that is to me

00:35:39.00 I [ __ ] I couldn't care like who cares I think she's the second longest living

00:35:42.23 monarch I couldn't care less well I mean you don't have to I'm just saying

00:35:48.12 it was in the damn news it's not in my world I didn't see that news that's not

00:35:53.14 okay come across [ __ ]

00:35:56.05 aren't you part of england or something I saw her with Paddington bear that was

00:36:01.20 she she's on your money yeah aren't you guys she's British

00:36:05.16 yeah but I don't I don't use all right see that picture oh what a cute photo

00:36:10.13 that is a nice photo all right on the left that's a kid so and the guy to her

00:36:16.15 right well he murdered his wife right didn't he kill his wife that's

00:36:21.03 prince William on the right her right not my right her the little

00:36:26.09 the kids no no not the kid her son her who is he prince Charles Charles

00:36:33.07 Charles didn't Charles kill Diana isn't that a thing

00:36:37.09 I thought he killed her I'm sorry she died running from paparazzi in a tunnel

00:36:43.02 with do die fyed I feel like they're I feel like I've heard that he killed

00:36:48.09 her dude and there is a conspiracy theory for every celebrity death ever

00:36:53.11 made but that's not a large one I don't think okay yeah that guy

00:36:56.20 Charles is her son so it's the pictures left but yeah yeah her right yeah that's

00:37:02.08 Charles and Camilla yeah didn't he cheat on Diana with Camilla

00:37:07.02 yes okay so that's right I know something I mean why did you just start

00:37:10.12 saying allegedly every time you put a mouth in the middle well I'm asking

00:37:13.10 questions I'm literally I'm not saying these as facts I've raised both of these

00:37:17.02 as questions I gotta I should I feel like I need to step in and say this

00:37:21.03 before you go too far down this road Andrew uh just so you know Gavin knows

00:37:26.09 next to nothing about england so okay his his English knowledge is brutally

00:37:31.13 limited I've learned over the years so just take take some of the stuff he says

00:37:36.02 with a grain of salt ask me a question Andrew uh

00:37:39.20 I don't even know what that tho are those

00:37:43.02 Williams kids I think that's William to the left right that's William and

00:37:48.18 uh Kate yeah I keep wanting to say McKinnon but it's

00:37:52.17 definitely not Kate McKinnon middle ton I don't middle ton yeah

00:37:57.18 okay those are their kids and she you're thinking you're saying

00:38:02.09 that she could refer to those kids as whippersnappers

00:38:06.10 what she can refer to her son who's next to her who's 70 years old queen you

00:38:11.18 called Charles a whippersnapper goddess it's like an ironic understood

00:38:16.17 understood I don't know anything about the royal family oh you're not part of

00:38:20.14 my how does Geoff know more about it than you though

00:38:23.08 it's not part of my it's not part of my world I don't know commonwealth

00:38:26.22 I don't know what to tell you I don't think about this it's

00:38:29.23 literally more part of your world than

00:38:32.08 mine I just know about [ __ ] because well

00:38:34.09 hey I was in London like a month ago and they were setting up for the platinum

00:38:38.04 jubilee uh but b I just pay attention to the world and what's happening in it I

00:38:42.22 guess my world doesn't contain the royal

00:38:44.22 family it literally does though you're a part of the British commonwealth yeah

00:38:48.21 but it's not it's not in my peripheral like I get what you're saying it's in

00:38:54.02 your wallet I don't I don't have any cash on it okay

00:38:57.14 all right Andrew's Andrew is heavily invested in altcoin he pays for

00:39:01.16 everything with doj no no I'm not absolutely not I could tell

00:39:05.06 you about bayonetta platinum games I know a lot about platinum games flat

00:39:10.04 veined two okay near uh onomata near automata is that

00:39:13.19 how you say that one they make great games I just don't know anything about

00:39:18.01 platinum jubilee is that just a title that she got for raining so long or what

00:39:22.08 is well platinum is just like a you know how like people have wedding

00:39:26.21 anniversaries and stuff like a I see a golden anniversary yeah usually

00:39:30.06 different decades do you think the queen ever used her gold-plated wii

00:39:35.01 there's some video game company that there was some other anniversary of hers

00:39:39.14 they said you think she ever got that do you think the queen has ever played

00:39:44.13 wii bowling I feel like absolutely but she gave it a

00:39:48.20 go I bet there is uh there is like a whole wing of Buckingham palace where

00:39:54.05 dignitary dignitaries and foreign leaders and kings and queens and of

00:40:00.03 other uh monarchies have given gifts to the royal family that just get chucked

00:40:04.12 in and like throw it in that room they get so much of it I'm sure she doesn't

00:40:08.12 see 90 of it yeah I don't think she I actually don't think she needs any more

00:40:12.00 gold so she probably didn't even yeah so is the Nintendo or like another

00:40:15.05 company just did that I think a different company did that I

00:40:18.11 don't think it was a Nintendo okay yeah I think they're like trying to promote

00:40:21.22 their game I don't know it was like 250000 wii or something Jesus

00:40:26.22 so would you say that the queen has more

00:40:29.15 or less gifts than price's right winners have prizes if you're gonna measure

00:40:34.09 those against each other more way more way more yeah okay and she does she

00:40:39.17 doesn't have to pay all the taxes I bet the queen

00:40:43.14 I bet the queen could have a tag sale of Buckingham palace that would blow you

00:40:47.16 away you think the queen would be interested in a metal bread clip

00:40:52.05 she might dude I don't know I just watched the Martha Stewart spread clip I

00:40:56.06 just watched Martha stewart's great American yard sale or whatever I don't

00:40:59.10 know why the queen wouldn't do it Martha

00:41:01.06 Stewart is the closest thing to American

00:41:03.04 royalty we have what was she getting rid of dude she got rid of so much stuff

00:41:08.04 uh she got rid of like a lot of different cutlery she got rid of some

00:41:11.10 really old knives she got rid of a bunch of like really pretty plates and

00:41:16.08 furniture like chested drawers and I don't know

00:41:18.21 you watch it it's on hulu I watched the whole thing

00:41:22.08 uh so that came from whippersnappers huh I guess

00:41:28.10 what a [ __ ]

00:41:29.14 [Music]

00:41:30.17 Do you think this is another thought I had recently

00:41:34.00 uh-oh do you think anyone has stolen the equivalent of like what somebody has

00:41:39.16 made in ocean's 11 and small goods like what's the most value amount somebody

00:41:44.17 has stolen like I don't know like going into Walmart and stealing an apple

00:41:49.18 scrumping an apple or like a chocolate bar or something insignific

00:41:54.05 something very cheap low value but extreme low value but extreme quantity

00:41:59.05 so somebody gotten like what would be the equivalent of a cut of an ocean's

00:42:05.03 heist throughout their life in in apples or candy

00:42:07.15 small items like what's the most anyone without getting caught has successfully

00:42:13.01 stolen in small quantities would that even be feasible could you

00:42:16.01 steal enough let's just say like I don't know like bottles of soda or candy bars

00:42:21.18 well wasn't that kind of the plot of office space to steal like tints of it

00:42:25.22 was yeah yeah yeah but that was like a digital trend that was like how they

00:42:29.15 were moving pennies there was no physical transaction in that I'm just

00:42:33.07 imagining you know how like a serial killer has their trophies like a guy

00:42:36.18 that only steals like oh Henry bars has like 20000 rappers

00:42:41.16 what if someone went around and took all of the first dollars from

00:42:47.11 every business like the framework I wonder how many first I wonder how

00:42:52.10 rich you would be if you had every first dollar in in the world

00:42:55.13 that would be really rich I still obviously have to frame the

00:42:59.07 first one you stole this is a a little bit of an aside but

00:43:02.06 it reminded me I saw the other day that Shaq said he had the largest single

00:43:06.22 purchase in the history of Walmart wow wow I don't know if it's true or how it

00:43:10.22 was verified but apparently he was saying when he got traded by a woman

00:43:14.05 when he got traded from Orlando to phoenix he got to phoenix and had

00:43:17.23 nothing and he just said I'm going to buy everything I need and he went to

00:43:20.21 Walmart it said at like three in the morning and spent about 70000 worth of

00:43:25.05 stuff in one in one purchase from Walmart that was back when he played for

00:43:30.00 phoenix so it's possible some other person

00:43:32.12 has spent more Walmart since then but uh according to him when he played for the

00:43:38.00 phoenix suns he had the largest single purchase in the history I'll give

00:43:41.19 it I'll give money to the richest family yeah

00:43:44.21 could you imagine trying to park a moving truck in a standard parking space

00:43:52.02 you just have to take a whole row and people couldn't even be mad at I love

00:43:56.10 the idea of Shaq like parking his moving truck to the front of Walmart I just

00:44:01.05 feel like we're we're loading up I need chairs I need tables [Music]

00:44:05.18 70 grand does that like go through a checkout yeah yeah he said he he like

00:44:10.02 paid for it with his like so I I didn't I was kind of like half listening it was

00:44:13.06 I was doing something else at the time but uh he said that his credit card got

00:44:16.19 declined and he was like run it again I ain't poor and then they tried again and

00:44:20.01 his credit card got declined then he got

00:44:20.15 to call like American express or whoever and like convince them that it was him

00:44:24.16 and he said he got a call and they were like jack you're never going to believe

00:44:26.08 this but somebody just tried to spend 70

00:44:29.12 000 of your money at Walmart and he's like I'm that guy it's me [Laughter]

00:44:35.01 Eric said imagine being behind him in line that'd be great how many shopping

00:44:40.13 carts he would need or the idea of him trying to like sneak

00:44:44.00 in express checkout like it crosses the line of so absurd that you just have to

00:44:48.10 allow it he said he bought he was like I bought like seven tvs uh you know all

00:44:53.07 stereos I had to buy like underwear toothpaste t-shirts plates like he

00:44:56.20 bought an entire life like everything a person would need to live I guess he

00:44:59.23 just left everything else in Orlando and was like I'll see eventually seven tvs

00:45:04.02 yeah it's about to say I love the idea of I'm getting all the essentials seven

00:45:08.21 tvs we're opening with seven tvs need seven of those

00:45:11.08 what can you do with seven yeah not not start with one and we'll see how many

00:45:15.12 more I need just start with seven you're really committed to the tech at

00:45:19.15 that time too not to like we've had tv talk recently but tvs I feel like are

00:45:24.07 changing like every five years like buying all seven at the same time is a

00:45:28.13 decision all right I gotta figure out what year it was that he

00:45:33.03 yeah they could have been crt yeah oh god all right you need an entire

00:45:38.06 truck just for the crts so he played for the phoenix suns oh no

00:45:44.01 2008-2009 they weren't crts ah 2008 he was getting flat screen that's

00:45:48.23 disappointing that's definite flat screen territory what does show me mean

00:45:55.03 just talking to Eric oh oh no we were we were in a space

00:45:59.01 and Geoff pointed at a tv and just kept going huh right

00:46:02.05 and I didn't know what the [ __ ] he was talking about but it was just a frame

00:46:05.23 around a tv he was so thrilled about it I thought it was pretty cool yeah why

00:46:10.15 does nick said I love a frame around a tv why

00:46:13.22 why nick this just looks nice look at this no but it doesn't it like when it's

00:46:19.03 on it's stylish when it's off I think show the Mona Lisa but

00:46:24.03 I I don't think tvs look ugly tv when it's on art when it's off is how they

00:46:29.06 describe it it's relaxed nick said it's relaxing

00:46:33.23 so look at a frame around the tv relaxes nick.

00:46:40.12 I just know you're so stressed out you're just like

00:46:44.06 I need something to calm me down oh as nick calls it ah glowing art

00:46:50.13 let me turn this tv off I am right there with nick you guys are making fun of

00:46:56.11 him for a totally valid hell yeah nick I

00:46:59.21 just I think see a tv off with no classy if it has an image and it's art like

00:47:06.02 they're displaying that's fine but when you turn off a tv and it's just a blank

00:47:09.21 screen with a frame around it it looks uglier than just a tv does I don't think

00:47:14.01 it does that no I think it always it goes into like an art mode where you can

00:47:17.12 you've sent me a photo of a tv that was turned off completely that had a frame

00:47:21.07 around it I've seen it yeah yeah well that was the rt one that they hand made

00:47:24.20 these are the ones that like you buy no but I didn't the frame like the handmade

00:47:28.09 part of it was great I think that looked awesome yeah

00:47:32.10 they just didn't have they're not listen they're not using it to the to the

00:47:37.07 height of its potential but that's my point like unless they all have that

00:47:41.19 where it's pre-built or whatever they do turn the tv off to bring the

00:47:45.09 masterpieces to life simply press the power button on the one remote and watch

00:47:49.06 art mode turn your blank tv screen into a private exhibit of curated creations

00:47:52.19 why am I trying to sell these [ __ ]

00:47:55.05 tvs I don't even have one I just think it's cool shackled by seven

00:47:59.10 at least what was his jersey number Shaquille O'neal

00:48:02.21 yeah what did he play us I think he probably bounced around depending on

00:48:07.07 what he was playing uh he played for a lot of teams 34 Eric

00:48:12.06 thanks he was 34 in la 32 in Miami 33

00:48:14.17 when he was at lsu 32 on the suns 36 in Boston 32 on the magic and 33 on the

00:48:21.18 cavs so he's just a 32 to 303630 yeah runner there 36 for the celtics is

00:48:28.08 Marcus smart currently here's hoping that number gets retired nobody will

00:48:33.01 ever be 36 again it's tomorrow right game tonight six

00:48:37.08 tonight tonight I thought it was Friday it's Thursday night

00:48:42.08 it's Thursday [ __ ] okay it's in a couple hours

00:48:44.10 Jesus I was not mentally prepared for this well I'm also not mentally prepared

00:48:48.21 for this and I've been trying all [ __ ] week

00:48:52.23 the word the best part is people already know

00:48:56.04 you know you know what's [ __ ] up dude what if they win this game tonight which

00:49:00.13 would be awesome do you know when they play game seven when on my birthday.

00:49:05.23 [Music]

00:49:07.11 That poo yeah that's uh yeah wow that's high stakes you think like

00:49:14.06 talk about talk about good socks bad socks uh [ __ ] that the the risk of them

00:49:21.22 [ __ ] the bed on my birthday and me having to deal with that for the rest of

00:49:28.02 my [ __ ] life wow yeah it's almost like when you drop

00:49:32.04 that derrick white card and you curse that entire game potentially you add

00:49:37.01 that weight on well let's hope they win yeah well

00:49:40.16 fingers crossed I think they'll win tonight I'd be shocked if they lose

00:49:44.01 three in a row Gavin said Eric asked Gavin what the final score

00:49:48.08 for the game will be and Gavin said 80-94

00:49:51.05 that would be an incredibly low scoring game oh what's the number

00:49:56.17 I mean it could happen but given the playoff I mean at two of the best

00:50:01.14 defenses in basketball I think it's more likely going to be in the low 100s

00:50:06.19 probably 104112 or something but yeah well 8094 is bold

00:50:09.17 I hope that god the celtics scored more than 80 points tonight

00:50:13.06 oh good eric's trying to see if he's a time traveler that's excellent that's

00:50:16.06 excellent you might have just caught him in a loop it's a weird sport basketball

00:50:20.02 it's a lot of uh scoring yeah yeah they like to score

00:50:23.12 why does that make it I guess if you're soccer because if both teams are going

00:50:28.08 to score the low 100s it's like how many times are you really excited what

00:50:32.04 happens yeah yeah really yeah you are yeah it's exciting all the way through

00:50:38.04 there's too much scoring uh points what are you talking about I just think

00:50:42.07 if something happens all the time while you're watching it it's not interesting

00:50:45.22 let's have a [ __ ] blast and watch one one go do a tie let's [ __ ] whoo

00:50:50.21 that's great thrilling thrilling high stakes I'm not saying I

00:50:55.12 agree or disagree with you Gavin but did you say that something's always

00:51:00.15 happening and it's so it's not interesting like if if uh a Michael bay movie

00:51:05.20 if it was like two and a half hours of explosions which a lot of the time it

00:51:10.20 yeah for like 20 minutes and it's like it's

00:51:14.04 it cheapens it now I understand what you're saying but it would be like

00:51:17.07 saying there's too much running in soccer it cheapens it like the movement

00:51:20.21 you're not what you're not sharing a run you're sharing a goal but you are

00:51:24.13 cheering runs you're cheering you're treating the momentum of a run a team

00:51:29.07 can go on a 10-0 run and change the entire uh like forecast the end result

00:51:33.06 is I hope they score a goal but what about are you okay with the fact that at

00:51:37.12 most they're scoring three points per per score

00:51:40.13 it's not like football's six points guaranteed you're [ __ ] gonna really

00:51:43.15 work for them if you're Steph curry you're allowed to have a seven point

00:51:46.19 play apparently does the number a point it's just an

00:51:50.00 insane you think games should have a limited mechanism to how they score

00:51:55.11 no I'm just saying like if I watch a football game and it's like 2-1

00:52:00.01 the goals were like very exciting because there was a lot of time between them

00:52:05.05 but isn't it the result of the game that you're invested in more so than the

00:52:10.04 mechanism of adding points like isn't shouldn't that I feel like

00:52:14.11 that's more of a factor for me yeah would you play like a would you

00:52:19.18 play a capture the flag on blood gulch first to 50 no it'd be like it's

00:52:23.20 exciting when when it scored once if every time I score once it's worth

00:52:28.23 six that might be interesting do I get the ability to go for eight

00:52:32.05 I gotta yeah I don't know man like I think the the beauty of soccer

00:52:36.17 and the allure of soccer is like the fluidity of motion and how the game

00:52:41.11 plays out and I I think basketball had is the exact same way

00:52:46.06 like you're you're constantly watching uh

00:52:49.13 the fluidity of the team how a team will make a defensive response to something

00:52:53.18 that another team is doing and then how that team counters it or doesn't it it's

00:52:57.21 like it's constantly interesting there's too much to watch on the screen

00:53:02.09 I the thing I've had trouble with these finals is I want to watch them multiple

00:53:05.18 times because I want to see what every player is doing uh on in relation to

00:53:09.11 everything else that's going on in the court like

00:53:12.10 basketball's non-stop interesting [ __ ]

00:53:14.06 happening at all times fascinating not that we're in this era I just I it

00:53:18.00 baffles me the idea of being like oh another dunk they're dunking again okay

00:53:21.16 I'm not like with it I'm just like it's like score

00:53:24.05 over there running back score over there I know but a dunk is always exciting to

00:53:27.17 me it doesn't matter how many times it happens

00:53:30.06 I went to a game with Geoff it was very exciting it was very cool environment it

00:53:35.07 was I really had a good time in general I don't think I could watch

00:53:41.03 like 50 games in a year oh well a lot of people can't I mean yeah it's

00:53:45.12 not most people don't watch every game of their team you know I wouldn't

00:53:49.16 imagine oh really I don't think so there's 82

00:53:52.20 games and then if you make it all the way to the if you make it all the way if

00:53:56.11 you make it all the way through the playoffs to the finals you're playing

00:53:59.20 another quarter of a season you're playing another 24 games it depends on

00:54:03.04 the sport like I will watch every seahawks game every year because there's

00:54:07.03 16 of those and it's one a week like that's a very manageable when you get

00:54:12.00 into like hockey and football or basketball and um baseball becomes more

00:54:16.02 challenging you have multiple games a week I like the idea of playoffs

00:54:20.17 celebrity of like you play every team and then something happens my uh my

00:54:24.16 limit's 82 games baseball it's hard to keep up with a full season and try to

00:54:28.04 watch every game but I can watch every basketball game 82 is not too hard the

00:54:31.18 playoffs are always great yeah for any sport it's always exciting are we a

00:54:36.06 sports podcast I don't think that's right no we're a baseball we're a

00:54:39.02 baseball equipment podcast

00:54:41.11 we're a time traveling baseball equipment I do

00:54:44.13 that yeah so speaking of uh we'll probably start wrapping it up here soon

00:54:48.21 but I've been meaning to ask you this guys this for a while now but has

00:54:53.18 anybody experienced any new potential time travel

00:54:56.16 uh issues it has future you uh maybe manipulated your lives anyway

00:55:00.19 recently that you could account for yeah

00:55:03.07 I realized today when you asked me about uh had I done the baseball video I

00:55:07.05 quickly went back in time and posted it in the slack that's fair yeah

00:55:11.18 just so I wouldn't feel on the back foot there

00:55:15.22 well I don't think yeah I don't think anything I've had a pretty uneventful

00:55:20.15 life the last couple last week or two I uh

00:55:23.09 I I don't even know if I've talked about it but I got my new bike and I've been

00:55:26.21 writing it every day and like nothing's happening everything's just like life's

00:55:30.06 good there yeah I guess so yeah no it is you're right it is it is good I've got

00:55:33.11 it it hasn't that yeah I mean with exceptions good for everything except

00:55:36.23 for this podcast yeah I mean with the exception of Emily getting you know

00:55:40.02 getting covered in us being quarantined for that week but

00:55:43.05 like it's been pretty uneventful life yeah I'd say that I'm at a point where

00:55:46.11 I'm thinking about whipper snappers is like a reflection of the thrill that is

00:55:50.14 happening in my life at the moment I'm having extended thoughts about what

00:55:54.12 whipper snappers mean in the age limits probably not a lot going on that's

00:55:58.10 exciting I want to buy you both uh a three pack of these new socks by the way

00:56:03.16 I would love to have a pair yes I want to see if any effect

00:56:06.16 has any effect on your lives have you noticed like you know red is bad but or

00:56:12.00 the other is any other color like particularly good

00:56:14.21 uh no okay no I'm trying not to get hung up on like the intricacies of good

00:56:19.19 just trying to avoid bad I think this will be out by the time and if not maybe

00:56:24.10 we can edit I think you'll know know this Geoff the fact that Gavin and I are

00:56:28.15 on survive block island season two which is like survivor meets mine craft yes if

00:56:33.03 I could get a pair of those socks Gavin if I get voted out first I'm wearing

00:56:36.12 those [ __ ] socks we're gonna have a problem I yeah I love that the other day

00:56:40.23 this is actually funny I didn't I forgot

00:56:42.21 about this uh Andrew accidentally texted

00:56:46.00 me some stuff he was he meant to send to you Gavin about like

00:56:49.15 scheming for survive block island and I was like

00:56:52.23 uh you probably shouldn't be telling me this stuff and he's like are you on the

00:56:56.06 show uh and I was like no I'm not in the show and he's like oh you'll just

00:56:59.09 disregard it but I'm producing it I help make it I'm gonna be watching in the

00:57:03.07 control room everything that you're doing and now I know your dumb plans so

00:57:07.01 I can I can make sure to catch them to clarify my plan yeah the plan was

00:57:11.07 just the fact that neither of us have capture cards for a computer and I don't

00:57:15.05 know if we need those and the premise of like part of the story just not being

00:57:19.04 present because neither of us are capturing what is happening like where

00:57:22.23 do we do we make that home where do we film it yeah you guys film from home oh

00:57:26.15 I can't film from home you can't play a you can't film a pc game on steam no

00:57:31.03 I've like rearranged I've I guess mine craft

00:57:34.02 well you might have to come in for it then well all right

00:57:38.17 so wait I do need a capture card no you just need to be able to do you have obs

00:57:42.22 no I'll figure it out it's just a pc game and you just have to be able to

00:57:50.23 gonna be in that and uh I'm not gonna back stab you Gavin promise pinky swear oh
