00:00:00.03 [Music]

00:00:09.16 [Music]

00:00:14.15 Hello and welcome to another episode of the F**kFuckFacePodcast what are you doing my

00:00:19.20 name is Geoff Ramsey with me as always Andrew panton it is 3 p.m on the dot

00:00:25.12 which is when we start Gavin knows this he's always exactly on time he's got a

00:00:30.21 good 3540 seconds before he comes in speaking to Gavin I didn't introduce him

00:00:36.08 because he wasn't here yet but I'm assuming he'll be sliding in

00:00:40.12 right on time he just dispenses what did he say he's rebooting his computer at 3

00:00:45.09 p.m why when did he post that right now at 3

00:00:48.18 p.m oh I see I'm I was scrolled up sorry I wasn't up to date well that's a weird

00:00:52.12 time to reboot your computer that's that's the time that we started he's now

00:00:57.01 one minute late which has got to be I think personally uh

00:01:00.04 catastrophic to his psyche I know how much he hates inconveniencing others by

00:01:05.20 being too early or too late and here we are

00:01:10.20 pushing towards 302. Uh this is episode 114 season four

00:01:14.18 year three is that right no no season four I think we're still in two seasons

00:01:22.08 season four yeah this is your thing I don't remember how

00:01:26.16 I guess I have no [ __ ] idea it's long it's your thing it's been so long I

00:01:31.14 would argue that this podcast is our thing but it is but this the the naming

00:01:36.06 convention is it's yours you've done this season four year two

00:01:40.23 volume one episode 114

00:01:44.08 uh I feel like my voice may be betraying uh

00:01:48.06 how tired I am uh can I bring something up just before Gavin is here yeah please

00:01:54.07 I don't understand the year and date I produce the podcast and I still don't

00:01:57.21 understand the naming convention it makes no sense yeah I don't I don't get

00:02:01.14 it I don't get like the seasonality of it I don't get like what year I don't

00:02:05.16 know what year this is I don't like I I just guess

00:02:08.22 this is this is season four we determined that after season three ended

00:02:13.12 and season four began season five hasn't started yet so clearly we are in season

00:02:19.07 four uh this is the second year that we are producing this podcast in hence uh

00:02:24.21 year two and then this is the first iteration of this podcast that we've

00:02:28.05 done hence volume one uh episode 114

00:02:30.16 that's just the number it's just the 114th one of these we've done that one's

00:02:33.18 easy to figure out that's the only number I care about actually yeah when

00:02:37.05 when would we have a volume two I'll tell you the exact moment I stopped

00:02:41.07 carrying Eric was when we we started this I was like we should have an

00:02:46.16 extremely long like 172 episode season and then season two

00:02:51.06 be three episodes and then Geoff changed the season the next episode and I gave

00:02:55.10 it right I just no longer I punted I have no clue where we are why we're

00:02:59.18 we're in the position that we're in all I care about is the number that Geoff

00:03:03.16 doesn't seem to care about at all how about this how about I stop that and

00:03:07.06 then you just do the interest from now I

00:03:08.23 don't know we can do whatever the [ __ ]

00:03:10.21 number combination thing you guys want to do no I enjoy it I'm just lost in it

00:03:14.13 I have no issue with it again I just I just said I didn't understand I didn't

00:03:17.14 say I didn't like it I just said no it's great and and also

00:03:21.07 you said whatever number thing we want to do I felt like we were really clear

00:03:24.12 about just the episode number being the number three all right so [ __ ] it we

00:03:27.21 won't do year four or year two we won't do the vlog I just said I didn't

00:03:32.01 understand [Music]

00:03:36.17 there's no room for complaints uh in in my brain today you're clearly

00:03:41.05 complaining because you don't understand it you're not complaining because you

00:03:44.10 like it you're not saying I don't understand it but I love it you're

00:03:47.05 saying I don't understand I don't get the point of it so we just won't do it

00:03:48.17 anymore we wasn't complaining I was just I was saying that I didn't understand I

00:03:52.23 was saying it from the podcast it is d lord it no

00:03:56.04 longer exists this is episode 114 I guess why are you fighting

00:04:00.19 uh because you're four minutes late you did this this is your fault we're

00:04:06.11 dropping the volume and the seasonality and the year

00:04:10.16 counting because Andrew and Eric don't understand it and I don't want to

00:04:13.21 confuse them or over complicate their little bra to be fair this opened with

00:04:17.05 you didn't remember what it was I figured it out you know you know anybody

00:04:22.10 else can start the [ __ ] podcast at any [ __ ] point in 114 episodes it

00:04:27.03 doesn't always have to be me I gotta say something to start the podcast

00:04:31.05 so how about this I retire from starting

00:04:33.11 the podcast you can start at however you guys want to and I will sit back and I

00:04:37.12 will not judge you for one and I'll let you go and whatever the numbering naming

00:04:41.11 convention you guys want to use this is [ __ ] awesome with me I'm gonna take a

00:04:45.07 break for a couple years and let you guys handle it from here on out Gavin

00:04:49.00 how are you doing I hate say it guys I think Geoff's in a bad mood I think Geoff

00:04:52.20 might be in a bad mood I realized right as I pressed reboot I didn't need to do

00:04:56.11 it I remembered what the problem was with my sound and then uh I don't really

00:05:00.00 know how to stop that process what are you I'm so confused when did you realize

00:05:03.01 you had an issue well my sound my mic wasn't right and then uh

00:05:06.12 usually I fixed it by rebooting and then I remembered that I'd actually muted it

00:05:10.05 in the setting somewhere as it was rebooting and I was like oh that's a

00:05:13.22 fight that's five minutes gone flushed those five minutes is this the latest

00:05:17.23 you've ever been to a show uh three minutes four minutes four minutes yeah I

00:05:21.09 think it might be I think it might be the latest you've ever been I'm

00:05:24.08 embarrassed it was odd for you to say rebooting at the time you would join

00:05:28.12 because I kind of assume you're just waiting in the wings to hop in like

00:05:32.04 you're there a few minutes early but you just wait it out the fact that it was

00:05:36.19 like time to go and you realized your car wouldn't start it was a very odd post

00:05:41.20 yeah I was outdoors like six minutes ago I'm sway what were you doing outdoors I

00:05:45.16 was ripping vines off the side of my house that my house is being engulfed by

00:05:49.23 nature we really shouldn't have built stuff I feel like what do you mean

00:05:53.11 nature's taking it back oh it's a constant struggle right you gotta you

00:05:56.12 gotta reclaim what's yours you gotta fight nature sometimes vines can be a

00:06:00.06 good look though I could enjoy a like a Viney side of a house I guess you're a

00:06:04.06 vine guy I could be a vine guy yeah it has to be very specific you don't want

00:06:07.22 too much but vines can look nice was it a thing that would like damage the house

00:06:11.12 unless you you removed it yeah it was sort of creeping inside oh I killed it

00:06:15.11 yesterday and then today it's just like shriveled twigs but it's still stuck to

00:06:19.10 it and I'm ripping it down there's like dust and now there's marks all over it

00:06:22.16 what are we talking about this week I don't know andrew's got a lot to talk

00:06:26.04 about so why don't you just kick it off buddy I have a lot to talk about I heard

00:06:29.20 you say that you said that to Eric when I came into pleasant

00:06:32.07 I have a lot to talk about today but I can't talk about it now so I'm just

00:06:35.09 Kevin you were four minutes late and look what look what's happening was that

00:06:38.23 bad pleasantries as well no pleasantries go too long I think pleasantries were

00:06:42.06 good I was just what I was saying Geoff when you came into it is I have a lot to

00:06:46.11 talk about because we we filmed survive block island last week but I can't talk

00:06:48.13 about any of the specifics of it because it's not going to be out for a few

00:06:51.21 months so I have plenty to talk about in

00:06:53.21 that way but I can't actually say any of

00:06:56.00 it on the show unfortunately I feel like that will have to be one of our future

00:06:59.15 episodes where we debrief after that show's over I would love to be a

00:07:03.00 supplemental maybe yeah we were talking about that uh as maybe a supplemental in

00:07:06.19 the pleasantries um I think some people recommended it in the some comment

00:07:11.20 leavers recommended it but uh I agree and let me just say right now um

00:07:15.11 you know we we filmed survived block island was it last week or I can't even

00:07:19.16 remember last last week and um you know obviously it's not going to come out

00:07:23.21 until I believe September and if you're not familiar with what we're talking

00:07:28.10 about it's like uh we recreated the game survivor in mine craft and then this was

00:07:33.14 the second season Gavin and Andrew were both in it as contestants

00:07:37.18 it's all shot and done and in the can but obviously if we can't discuss it

00:07:41.23 because that would provide potential spoilers and this show's not going to

00:07:45.14 come out for two months but what I will say and the only thing I will say is

00:07:49.14 that I I genuinely appreciate the professionalism

00:07:53.11 that you're both showing by being uh in the same uh online room together as it

00:07:58.15 were sharing in a conversation uh despite despite everything that

00:08:02.19 transpired uh I'll you guys are nothing but professional and your ability to

00:08:07.00 hold it together right now [Laughter]

00:08:09.14 it's masterful and uh it's something to be studied congratulations it was

00:08:13.10 interesting it was a great experience it

00:08:15.08 was yeah it was layered there's a lot to say about it can I talk about the thing

00:08:19.09 I told both of you already I'd like to hear eric's read I don't feel like

00:08:22.19 that's a spoiler for anything I'm vague about specifics I don't know what you're

00:08:26.19 doing about yeah you're so [ __ ] vague nobody knows what you're talking about.

00:08:30.11 [Laughter]

00:08:31.13 I I did a thing that's arguably worse than the shift key I think I could talk

00:08:35.18 about that without anything away oh my god yeah you did you did I mean

00:08:42.02 here's why it's stupider you're a [ __ I gamer I don't play on

00:08:47.00 the pc though at all I didn't know so for context I don't I never play games

00:08:52.03 on the pc I'm purely console when I was first told I'm gonna I'll talk to you

00:08:55.23 I'd love to hear your opinion on this Eric is this worse than me not knowing

00:08:59.21 the shift capitalization thing when this

00:09:02.04 started I was told before the experience

00:09:04.21 even began I was like how do you go full screen and I was told f11 and I said is

00:09:09.11 there an f11 key or do I have to hold f and the eleven to which that's the oh

00:09:14.19 hey man what's the 11. Yeah that was the 11.

00:09:17.00 There's not there's not an 11 key so it's off to a terrible start I have no

00:09:21.17 idea how keyboards work I have no information about anything but so no

00:09:25.22 matter what and filming you're there first day last day I just imagined you

00:09:30.07 holding f the number one and then the number one on the numpad yeah right it's

00:09:34.15 the other side he's just like this isn't good for my hands like the capital I

00:09:39.14 those keyboards suck it's dumb um we gotta sit you down and

00:09:43.14 teach you the keyboard one day that would be great I'd love that

00:09:47.10 because the mac it doesn't have an f11 a mac keyboard or at least mine doesn't I

00:09:51.09 don't know if other ones do but I'm not familiar with the f section anyway

00:09:55.12 so we film everything on survive block island is over and the shoot's done and

00:10:00.03 I realized I left my computer on and I'm like I'll shut everything down but I

00:10:03.23 realized that the server was still open for where we filmed things and my

00:10:07.17 partner was in the room and I was like hey I can show you some of the stuff

00:10:12.08 that I saw like this would be cool and so I load in and I'm moving around

00:10:17.02 and I'm just like showing them things and they immediately say can you go full

00:10:22.01 screen I can't see anything to which I went full screen and I I had filmed so

00:10:26.18 when you're watching survival block island know that every single moment you

00:10:31.22 see of me I played the entire my entire experience was in windowed I was in the

00:10:35.17 tiny I was in the tiny window mode every time you see me in the show I get the

00:10:40.17 tiny window I went full screen it blew my mind how much easier it was to see

00:10:45.08 everything and how big everything looked I don't know about your computer but

00:10:48.10 when I open mine craft and it starts windowed it's it's not just it's like

00:10:52.02 small windowed it's like less than fifty percent of the screen it's like

00:10:55.14 minesweeper it is it there's a great comparison it was the exact size of

00:10:59.21 minesweeper so every single moment you see me in that show know that I'm

00:11:04.11 experiencing it through a minesweeper-sized screen god damn you

00:11:07.21 didn't think after day one just to be like yeah let me figure this out um you

00:11:11.23 know it's you have to move files around so much and I was unfamiliar with

00:11:15.11 everything so I like just being able to click to like audacity and the different

00:11:19.09 programs it never even occurred to me to go full screen and then when I did I

00:11:23.03 realized holy [ __ ] this is like a completely different game this is also

00:11:27.09 much easier to see also Gavin you're assuming he made it

00:11:31.09 past day one we don't know that's very fair it's a large assumption

00:11:35.10 oh dear idea so I I did that I explained

00:11:38.05 to my partner that I had not I'd been in windowed my entire experience and uh

00:11:43.10 uh they said that I was a lunatic and that this is worse than me not knowing

00:11:46.21 the shift key capitalized I was just curious Eric how did how you feel you

00:11:50.07 played with a colossal handicap that's insane to play in the windowed mode and

00:11:55.14 then it's crazy to think that there's an 11 key [Laughter]

00:11:59.11 I mean really like it's kind of a one-two punch like you kind of looked at

00:12:03.11 the keyboard and then said oh there it is to be clear these were very separate

00:12:07.16 this was like before the experience began and after I knew the f11 by the

00:12:12.12 end I just never used it I was aware of how to do it guys guys let's be fair I

00:12:16.08 knew what f11 was by the end I had to clarify on my mac keyboard f11 is my

00:12:21.03 volume down so it's actually a frequently used key for me yeah but it's

00:12:24.05 just there's no f on it so I don't know I didn't know there's the [ __ ] f

00:12:27.08 section I never use a keyboard that isn't a mac keyboard I have a mac

00:12:31.07 keyboard and it's got an f11 on it I'm looking at it does it well I'll take a

00:12:35.10 [ __ ] photo of my my keyboard and I don't know why you're throwing around

00:12:37.09 the f word so much you see there's a lot

00:12:39.16 of swear words happening right well he's

00:12:41.12 looking for f11 I'm looking for f11 yeah it's not the [ __ ] 11 key it's the f

00:12:45.19 doesn't stand for anything [Music]

00:12:48.05 yeah that's my keyboard it's got the the volume on it I even have a smaller

00:12:52.12 dinkier one that's let me get out of windowed so I can see this photo bigger

00:12:58.21 f11 I don't see the f11 where's the f11

00:13:02.04 at the top oh the little numbers I don't have those hang on hang on oh you said

00:13:06.06 that you knew where the f11 key was by the end and now you're telling me that

00:13:10.12 you don't know where the f11 key is okay you're right you just know I don't know

00:13:14.16 I think you just exposed yourself no I knew where the f11 was on my other

00:13:18.13 keyboard I didn't think that my mac keyboard had any f's you're right it's

00:13:22.14 just so small I've never noticed the whole upper row is f1 you already need a

00:13:26.12 picture of how small this is yeah what are you talking about I just have I it's

00:13:31.16 listen it's noticeable when you look I just have never looked that closely so

00:13:36.01 wait it's small but it's noticeable but you know where it is but you've never

00:13:40.09 seen it well okay I knew where it was on my alienware keyboard that I never used

00:13:45.04 I learned that and up until this moment of you sending that screens hot of that

00:13:48.19 the little letters I never noticed it on

00:13:51.12 the mac keyboard where did you think the f keys were I just didn't think I had

00:13:55.07 any f keys on my mac keyboard

00:13:59.16 taking a screens hot those f keys are for those luxurious one per centers they uh

00:14:05.05 I'm just I'm I'm the leader I'm just floored it's a whole row

00:14:09.08 you just thought that there was just a row you don't use no I used the row I

00:14:14.07 just didn't know it was the f row I use the brightness all the time I use the

00:14:17.23 volume all the time I just never noticed

00:14:20.21 that there was an f on the little little thing oh man

00:14:24.08 I hate another I apologize you know what you know what I understand it already

00:14:28.11 hit bottom I had not I could you know what's the falling I take back some of

00:14:32.04 my anger from the beginning of the podcast I get why you don't understand

00:14:36.04 the number thing now it's uh now in fairness look at his picture he has a a

00:14:42.02 sort of squished f section it's a very tiny f it also seems to be covered by

00:14:45.16 copious amounts of food I need to yeah I ate lunch I ate lunch at my desk

00:14:50.15 there are two keys that all they say is f5 and six that's what okay Geoff's

00:14:55.21 exactly look at those keys that's all you would see that's all there that

00:15:00.03 that's all that there is and also they're the only keys with something in

00:15:03.09 the bottom right which immediately would make you go what is this yeah uh okay

00:15:08.23 when I look at it my brain you've got f5

00:15:10.23 you've got sesame seed you got f6 I

00:15:13.12 first of all that's onion ring there's some onion ring remnants

00:15:18.00 that's that's the main correction I need to make second of all I'm gonna be

00:15:22.08 honest I would look at those keys and go that's 80 blank those just do nothing

00:15:27.14 those are just blank keys that's how I would process that I've never

00:15:31.21 I just I figured no point I've never done anything he looks eighty percent

00:15:36.02 blank to you you write it off you don't yeah for the yeah like other twenty

00:15:40.16 worth my time yeah I guess they [ __ ]

00:15:42.14 up this keyboard they just even print anything on these buttons here's the

00:15:46.21 problem I have with that Andrew the escape key the shift key the tab key uh

00:15:52.00 and the return key and probably the delete key are all eighty percent empty

00:15:56.06 the space bar key is 100 empty absolutely true absolutely true it's true but

00:16:01.00 everybody knows the space bar and there's like bold lettering on the shift

00:16:05.16 and enter like there is the letters are important the f5 and f6 are very small

00:16:10.17 and not very bright they're they're dim that's dim dimly

00:16:14.06 they're the only thing on that key yeah I just I don't know I don't I've never

00:16:19.05 I've never what would I even use the f5

00:16:21.00 and f6 for refresh

00:16:35.03 mavis beacon [ __ ] is this you don't know what f5 does wait wait how do I do

00:16:41.05 I have to hit like enter or shift dude might be the most frequently used f key

00:16:46.13 on my keyboard absolutely go just open like a browser I'm in my browser hit

00:16:52.08 okay and then go to like just some other page and then hit f5 it doesn't do

00:16:58.04 anything oh my god oh wait you're on mac I'm on mac yeah maybe it's a controller

00:17:02.05 f5 on there is it a controller yeah

00:17:05.14 f5 I'm just I'm floored this rules guys can we while he's figuring out

00:17:11.18 letters and numbers can we take a step back and think about like just how

00:17:16.11 ludicrous this is uh zeroing in on the keyboard and how

00:17:20.20 we've we I I agree I think we all agree he needs a class right

00:17:24.16 here's what he here's what's really scary does he know how anything else

00:17:28.15 works does he know how a fridge works does he know how an oven works like do

00:17:33.12 we need to have just a basic class about all things like uh

00:17:36.19 clearly andrew's managed to navigate this far in life but

00:17:40.04 how many things is he using wrong or incorrectly or how many things is he

00:17:43.06 missing just in day to day [ __ ] we need to watch him we should study Andrew I

00:17:47.12 would like to sit in andrew's room for a week and just take notes and

00:17:51.10 deliver the results to him at the end I feel like Andrew we'd be we'd be like

00:17:54.11 we'd be sitting there taking notes and Andrew would go wait a minute you're

00:17:57.12 telling me this car has a reverse I can go backwards in a car I think I

00:18:01.22 run into issues where there are shortcuts shortcuts are really my

00:18:05.11 problem because I just manually when I refresh I just click the little spinny

00:18:09.12 thing in the top left so I've never even considered that I need a button to

00:18:13.20 refresh I'm but you're saying like in your ideal world you would have two

00:18:19.11 keyboards one lowercase one uppercase what do you mean no well I love the caps

00:18:23.22 key this is very this is established I'm a big capslock guy I love having the

00:18:29.11 button but that's a shortcut for everything being uppercase wait so

00:18:33.00 apparently the refresh is command r come on ah that's how you do it on a mac so

00:18:37.17 f5 doesn't I don't know what f5 actually does what is the equivalent of f so I

00:18:42.12 don't know what to find I'm on windows so f5 I use it in folders I use it in

00:18:46.02 browsers f5 is decrease uh keyboard brightness that's why there's nothing on

00:18:49.22 your keyboard for that what you would do would be assign something to the f5 I

00:18:54.09 see so it is a useless button it's not useless at all for me for you I'd say

00:18:59.12 yeah yeah Andrew I wouldn't be surprised

00:19:02.08 if Andrew said you mean to tell me I can get it there's something colder than

00:19:05.22 putting stuff in the fridge I just never opened the other side

00:19:09.03 because it's smaller and therefore I de-prioritized it it seemed like oh we

00:19:12.17 already found out last week that he'd eat he'd leave something in the freezer

00:19:16.06 for about four four days but yeah that's true that's true what do you mean are

00:19:19.14 you coming at me for the freezer thing listen I know freezers are important

00:19:23.05 because of outcast I'm aware of the cooling system

00:19:25.20 there is something cooler than cool and it's ice and you get ice from the

00:19:30.19 freezer ice cold is the coolest outcast is oddly educational it's great [Music]

00:19:36.20 oh a polaroid for a certain kind of person

00:19:40.21 I think it is yes yeah although I don't think I'm not sure shaking it actually

00:19:45.08 speeds that up because it's not didn't polaroid uh come out and say like please

00:19:48.12 don't shake your photos that doesn't work

00:19:51.09 they're like that's bad advice they're not they're not they're not professional

00:19:55.22 photographers okay so f5 and f6 on a mac keyboard would typically increase the

00:19:59.13 brightness of the lights on the inside I don't have those so in my my specific

00:20:04.19 case I have been right to not use f5 or f6 can we call this face episode f114

00:20:09.22 why not we're throwing all the names the

00:20:12.13 naming conventions at the window doesn't matter [Applause]

00:22:37.11 so let's just I just want to talk about that survive block island we should

00:22:41.08 definitely record a thing at some point discussing yeah we'll do we'll do a

00:22:45.12 supplemental where we dig in at some point later I would love to I

00:22:49.11 would love to talk to you guys about your experiences uh of it uh

00:22:53.19 anyway so yeah I think that'd be that'd be a good piece of supplemental content

00:22:57.15 for us we should also watch that monkey movie I'd love to we need to do that

00:23:02.15 speaking of movies there was an exciting uh reveal today I

00:23:06.11 was very happy or not today I guess earlier in the week time is ridiculous

00:23:11.19 I I got confirmation that our tuxedo has

00:23:14.12 arrived it's now in our possession where is it it's somewhere in the office it's

00:23:20.19 in my office at work you got one of Jackie chan's tuxedo

00:23:24.17 oh the bow tie comes in its own separate tiny bag

00:23:28.21 it also has a bow tie can I ask you a question Eric yeah did you smell it I

00:23:34.15 didn't I kept it in the bag because all all I did was open it and then open it

00:23:40.14 to like open the package and then also open the uh envelope to make sure that

00:23:46.10 the certificate of authenticity was there all I did was visually confirm

00:23:51.00 that we have received the tuxedo and the certificate of authenticity

00:23:55.22 because I want to get I mean I guess it would be Geoff and Gavin together to yeah

00:24:00.18 have a look take it out inspect it and then you know Andrew can also be on the

00:24:04.21 call and he can sort of see apple style but um you know we should get together

00:24:09.09 and have a look at the tuxedo tuxedo unboxing yes correct I think it would be

00:24:13.19 great there's a really really good chance that when we crack that open

00:24:17.23 which Gavin you should be involved in because you love to smell new things uh

00:24:22.04 freshly open things there's a really good chance that that

00:24:26.00 tuxedo smells like Jackie chan did in 2002.

00:24:28.12 Wow this is a lot of responsibility we've got to preserve this thing yes we

00:24:31.21 just like movie history we can't we like actually have to take care of this yeah

00:24:34.23 it can only be it's only going to be worn once and that's for the photo when

00:24:39.06 we recreate the poster and even then I should wear some sort of protective

00:24:43.12 layer between my body and suit to protect it we're not gonna kim

00:24:47.03 Kardashian this thing we're not gonna rip a five million dollar dress you're

00:24:51.02 we'll take very good care of it and then we're gonna hermetically seal it and uh

00:24:56.06 store it away for safe keeping until the

00:24:58.23 the museum happens I'm excited about the museum that's going to be a great setup

00:25:02.12 there's a lot of people we've got some good stuff for the museum I found the uh

00:25:06.10 the thrice to meet you the other day that's now perfectly preserved in a draw

00:25:11.03 dude that's awesome you know I used to have the original wrist pocket prototype

00:25:15.17 and I think I mailed it to a I think I mailed it to Rebecca maybe I gave it to

00:25:19.17 somebody damn I should have held on I was about to yell at you for mailing

00:25:23.01 some of our museum to uh to a listener but I think rebecca's fine yeah yeah she

00:25:28.17 she can have that she'd probably also mail it back if we wanted it [Laughter]

00:25:34.22 I was I showed this to Geoff but I was before survived block island I figured

00:25:38.17 I'd watch the first season just so I'm not a disadvantage and um I and meg

00:25:44.00 wanted to watch it with me so I cast it up to the the tv and I had to type in a

00:25:48.08 code for the rooster teeth app.

00:25:51.05 I was very insulted by what our app just randomly generated there

00:25:57.14 that was your random literally generated code that was my random code gavin's

00:26:02.19 code was c-u-u-c-k which is

00:26:08.23 emphatic crazy dude that's a hot cuck

00:26:16.23 oh god dude this is funny because I just got socks that said the same thing what

00:26:22.23 a coincidence

00:26:27.01 speaking of socks and you know we were talking about the uh

00:26:30.21 I had a bun I had a bunch of dumb ideas about socks last week but I did have an

00:26:35.11 idea the other day what if we sold just red socks just a pair of red socks

00:26:40.08 they don't say anything on them it's just red socks and you just buy or

00:26:45.14 beware and you can give them to people that you want to curse

00:26:48.21 okay so it's like a gift but the only the giver knows their bad luck so yeah

00:26:53.16 they're like bad luck socks but they don't

00:26:55.20 maybe even maybe you should even like I don't curse them in some way I would say

00:26:59.16 bless them but that maybe your blessings would be occurs to other people like

00:27:03.01 yeah can you reset this why are the red sox

00:27:06.01 cursed I don't remember the cursed red sox thing oh gavin's got bad luck socks

00:27:10.09 I had bad luck when I wore the the red socks oh oh oh oh okay so and then you

00:27:15.20 want to sell just socks that are red that are cursed

00:27:19.12 by Gavin yeah maybe like bad luck socks so then you could prank people or like

00:27:23.11 if there's somebody like say you really really don't like your stepdad right

00:27:28.15 but you got to give him a gift for Christmas give him red socks he'll think

00:27:32.13 oh wow little Eric loves me he got me the red sock he got me I mean they're

00:27:35.22 ugly and I don't wear red but whatever he cares about me so I'll wear him but

00:27:39.10 me and you know inside you're like that's right [ __ ] you're gonna

00:27:42.05 get a flat tire today and he probably will do we want to do like two versions

00:27:46.00 like one you buy them blank so you can curse them

00:27:48.14 yourself or or there's like another option where I've precursed them for you

00:27:51.19 we should just like how you signed all the baseballs that's interesting that's

00:27:55.09 interesting would you be willing to precurse a round of socks I I could

00:27:59.12 curse a hundred songs

00:28:04.08 wow I could curse a hundred socks is a great episode title for this that's

00:28:09.04 pretty good thank you I'm just imagining me just sitting over

00:28:12.10 the pair I just like cause I'm sitting crosstalk on the ground I put them in

00:28:16.02 front of me I got my hands hovering above him but I'm just like you little

00:28:21.11 just like okay now now we have to do it I wasn't

00:28:25.10 serious but now we have to do it because I gotta have the we had to have that

00:28:29.02 video I don't understand did you do that to your own pair of socks like why

00:28:33.23 because you have curse so what are you doing

00:28:37.04 why does that curse them why is that the curse I don't think all

00:28:41.05 surely not all red socks are cursed yeah

00:28:43.22 by default they don't print the curse on with the red dot

00:28:47.11 somehow red sox become bad news in gavin's presence so if all these red sox

00:28:52.12 are in gavin's presence in some way and he makes a point of acknowledging the

00:28:56.16 sock I think that's key you know he the sock has to know that he knows and then

00:29:01.13 we all know right and so I think that's how the curse works probably I just got

00:29:05.17 the slack notification for the merch channel from Eric we want to sell red

00:29:11.05 sox that Gavin will curse and then we will sell them

00:29:15.01 I think it's self-explanatory I think that that really sums up what exactly

00:29:19.09 they need to know that we want to do uh man so speaking of merch I have one more

00:29:24.16 dumb little idea I don't know if you guys saw but one of our uh peer podcasts

00:29:30.09 uh the one that Eric Eric is also on this one he likes it less than face but

00:29:34.09 he still is on it because it's his job and he once again eric's a professional

00:29:38.07 but that other podcast face jam the food one uh they released a very funny item

00:29:44.00 they released a like a switchblade fork called a switch fork

00:29:47.04 and they sold out in four minutes which I thought was really cool you know I

00:29:50.22 thought that was awesome that they were able to sell hundreds of those things in

00:29:54.00 four minutes I will say what was annoying was all the people in the

00:29:56.19 comments saying wow I wish face could sell merchandise this well I wish face

00:30:00.20 could run there uh could sell on time when they say they do like uh like these

00:30:04.07 guys do uh so we were catching some total shade that was unnecessary but

00:30:09.07 that got me thinking like what would our switch fork be

00:30:12.01 because I I already had a free minute sale haven't we yeah but I'm the I'm

00:30:15.20 saying that like they said when it was gonna go on sale and it went on sale and

00:30:19.01 it worked we were catching shade for like you know our stuff goes on still

00:30:22.12 whenever and I was thinking like what would our version of a switch fork be

00:30:26.13 because I I'm nothing if not opportunistic right they did all the r

00:30:30.12 and d on this thing they found a vendor they got it made they established a

00:30:34.14 relationship they proved that they could deliver the product the product

00:30:39.12 themselves so then how do we capitalize on their hard work and I had

00:30:43.21 how do you what if we made instead of a switch fork switchblade already exists

00:30:49.01 switch spoon is obviously too obvious we'd have to be like it had to be like

00:30:53.13 our flavor what if we made a switch [ __ ]

00:30:55.23 and when you hit the button just a little sign pops out that just says [ __ ]

00:31:00.13 switch [ __ ]

00:31:01.22 like like when joker has a gun and he pulls

00:31:05.14 the trigger and it says bang kind of yeah kind of yeah

00:31:10.00 or imagine if it was like a switch comb except there were no tines it was just a

00:31:15.12 solid piece of plastic and on it printed

00:31:18.02 in white letters was just the word [ __ ]

00:31:19.23 on either side then so somebody gives you some shade

00:31:23.02 you pull out a switch [ __ ] and you hit the button and you show them the word

00:31:26.19 [ __ ] and they're like whoa okay I'll back down I think I'd rather have like a

00:31:30.14 tiny bat like a switch bat like a small because you're expecting a knife

00:31:35.11 baseball yeah I think a tiny bat is very funny like a

00:31:38.14 switch bat like you hit the button yeah the bat pops out yeah like like

00:31:41.22 typically like a switchblade obviously as a weapon you expect a blade nobody

00:31:45.18 pulls out a tiny bat in a fight like it's almost useless yeah but see that's

00:31:49.15 a problem a tiny bat is useless I think a switch [ __ ] is useful because it

00:31:53.08 conveys a message emphatically I think they're equally useful I think both

00:31:57.11 things are equally needed I don't know I don't know I think

00:32:00.14 there's something to switch here's the d I would love to see a

00:32:03.15 design for it here's the deal it's going to sit in your head it's going to be a

00:32:05.16 little it's going to be a little brain worm it's going to sit in your head and

00:32:08.17 in a week you're going to be you're going to be clamoring for the switch

00:32:12.00 [ __ ] and you're going to go like oh it

00:32:13.18 just took it took a while to sink in for me but I get it now well let me ask you

00:32:16.22 this how small can a grown tube be that's an even yeah I like that that's a

00:32:21.18 great idea a little switch one of them be like oh you hit the button

00:32:27.11 it's just like a little click it doesn't even have enough time to make a sound

00:32:32.04 it's just it's going to the other side of the plastic

00:32:35.15 oh man stupid stuff speaking of stupid stuff

00:32:38.15 Geoff and I seem to be able to exist pretty well away from each other as soon

00:32:43.16 as we saw each other on the set of uh sbi just because Geoff was in the control

00:32:47.13 room and I was in a little room off to the side day one we're just like

00:32:51.06 shooting the [ __ ] talking about stuff and day one by the way you say day one

00:32:54.15 as if there was a day two but we don't know that there was a day to because

00:32:57.20 it's possible you were with the first person eliminated we can't give anything

00:33:01.12 that could approach a spoiler so day one

00:33:04.01 or only day you were saying so the first day of film wait is that anybody it's

00:33:09.09 the same it's the exact same just say on day one I got told off the same day

00:33:13.13 well I don't know what to say I'm gonna be day one's fine everyone was there on

00:33:17.15 day one yeah okay okay okay I think it implies that there was a day too well no

00:33:21.15 because we no matter what everybody has to be there on day five no matter what

00:33:25.17 two that's true you always have to be there day one and day five every single

00:33:29.06 person was there day one day five everyone had multiple days all right so

00:33:33.11 should I say that again no no no just go

00:33:37.11 what's wrong with you just say it so day one I'm talking to Geoff

00:33:43.03 shooting the [ __ ] in the kitchen Geoff immediately reaches into the fridge for

00:33:48.16 some sort of can of something and punches the shelf.

00:33:58.23 I'm like what is wrong with you he eventually pulls a drink out close

00:34:04.02 the fridge we talked like another 30

00:34:06.15 seconds and I fumble coffee all across the kitchen

00:34:10.08 it was literally like within 60 seconds our worlds just tip upside down we had

00:34:16.10 to just walk away from the situation I don't know why we just combine and

00:34:21.09 form stupid we're like we're the blunder twins you put us together

00:34:26.11 and it's just a form of a puddle of idiocy it's that we can

00:34:30.06 you're absolutely right dude I knocked over I by the way I got I'm a grown up I

00:34:35.19 get drinks out of fridges all day long every day I'm real good at it I don't

00:34:39.11 ever [ __ ] up I probably got drinks out of that fridge

00:34:42.04 300 times through the course of last week I [ __ ] within one second hanging

00:34:47.12 out with you I knocked over 42 cans maybe just catastrophe and then you shot

00:34:52.21 coffee I still don't understand how you did that

00:34:57.11 yeah it's one of those like fumbles where you know you're trying to catch it

00:35:03.18 just makes it go yeah yeah my immediate question is how shocked

00:35:07.02 were you Geoff that Gavin said hi in the same space as you that he took the time

00:35:11.08 it's the immediate thing I want to get to the bottom of was this instant did he

00:35:15.14 run over did you get a sense that he has learned from his past mistake

00:35:19.04 what was that I I will say that uh when Gavin told me I I took it I took what he

00:35:24.02 said to heart in the last face and so when I saw him I just had faith and we

00:35:29.07 spent plenty of time uh around each other it was lovely it was almost

00:35:33.15 I mean it's weird right because Gavin and I used to work in the same room

00:35:38.03 all day every day and then we lived together too so we'd go home and work

00:35:41.07 together and live together and drink together and play together and do

00:35:44.09 everything but pre you know we've had a pandemic the last couple years so

00:35:47.15 nobody's been working in the office yeah and before that probably about a year

00:35:51.18 before that I had left achievement hunter and so I was no longer working

00:35:55.15 with him every day I forget how much fun

00:35:57.22 it was to share an office space with you

00:35:59.18 gab and just to be around each other for more than you know 30 minutes at a time

00:36:03.20 dude it's fun as [ __ ] it's like like we combine with two separate

00:36:08.00 entities that combine and form just stupidity but we also it's very

00:36:11.16 creatively good yeah but we both you'll have an idea and then we'll just add to

00:36:15.12 it we end up with good stuff we should honestly just spend more time together

00:36:19.22 oh not filming and I I don't mean this I've been fortunate enough to work with

00:36:25.02 a lot of really creative people over the last 19 and a half years uh

00:36:30.00 all of which are some of which are in this uh on this podcast with me and I

00:36:33.15 mean everybody on the podcast is a creative person I've been fortunate

00:36:36.13 enough to work with in the last 19 years I'm just trying to make sure I'm not

00:36:40.01 shading anyone uh in addition to gus and

00:36:42.07 Bernie and all of achievement hunter and

00:36:44.04 all the people that I've worked with I I I don't think I've ever had a creative

00:36:48.07 partner like Gavin in in and I don't know that I ever will again I've never

00:36:52.05 been so creatively aligned or been with a person where like

00:36:55.05 it must have been what it was like for the Beatles not that I'm comparing other

00:36:58.12 Beatles because they have talent and what we do is dumb but where it's just

00:37:02.12 like it's just like every everything is good every like everything that when we

00:37:06.03 get together it's just like I don't know it's awesome it's hard to explain it

00:37:09.14 doesn't happen that way any with anybody else for me I appreciate you guys

00:37:13.05 described yourself as a voltron of incompetence when you get together and

00:37:16.22 then immediately went into the Beatles this is fantastic I mean that's often

00:37:20.23 how it would happen at home too when we lived together is that Geoff would you

00:37:24.03 know walk into the kitchen smash a glass booze would go flying over the back of

00:37:28.00 his head and then we'd sit down and make a game in mine craft that worked first

00:37:32.01 time and everyone could play while I had to raise my arm above my head to stop

00:37:36.02 the bleeding.

00:37:38.04 I probably bled more around Gavin than anybody else in my life

00:37:42.17 I've seen you bleed at least a pint and I've not even been there

00:37:48.02 this is a strange measurement probably a gallon of uh vomit too oh yeah

00:37:53.18 definitely tons of vomit and poop uh have I seen poop uh yeah but I don't

00:37:58.15 know if you've seen it but you've been around me while I'm full of poop

00:38:02.19 like oh yeah like when we live together hey I just [ __ ] myself for like dude

00:38:07.07 don't come into the living room for a minute I just [ __ ] all over the couch

00:38:10.21 and I got to clean it up you were literally like in my doorway

00:38:13.20 and I was like oh how much [ __ ] and you

00:38:15.17 I don't know I haven't really looked yet it was like in your pants

00:38:19.16 I just you were the first person I thought of you come to me before the toilet

00:38:25.20 you [ __ ] on the couch one time yeah how oh well not on purpose

00:38:32.23 what happened I as well I mean this is years ago so okay I'm going to make some

00:38:38.08 assumptions I'm going to assume I was drunk uh or hungover I'm going to assume

00:38:44.04 I probably wasn't eating well I'm probably I'm going to assume I probably

00:38:48.11 thought I farted and then realized very quickly that it wasn't oh no because

00:38:52.12 that's usually how it happened you may have [ __ ] yourself awake I may

00:38:57.11 have I have pooped myself awake before and you know what that is that might

00:39:01.00 have been it that might have been it yeah yeah it's a terrible way to wake up

00:39:05.15 I've never even considered that as a possibility but I got I'll say this

00:39:10.12 probably better to wake up than not that's fair

00:39:12.19 but in the contrast of waking up it's pretty bad it's a bad way to wake I I

00:39:17.02 realized it by the way um last week or the week before I read out one of my

00:39:21.00 notes that I didn't understand it was uh tuna fish can spill in the sea

00:39:25.16 I realized what that was afterwards oh tuna fish can

00:39:29.12 spill in the sea apparently there was a boat full of like tins of Judah

00:39:34.19 and I thought that is so messed up that like amongst the swimming

00:39:39.15 tuna just came down a bunch of thick like canned brethren

00:39:45.18 and how just messed up that is that humans basically caught them

00:39:50.05 tandem and then spilled them back to where they were from like how

00:39:55.16 it'd pointless like if you just go outside you're like ah it's raining

00:39:59.09 coffins again

00:40:02.19 it's exactly like that I was trying to think of other equivalents but that's

00:40:08.08 perfect oh how did you realize what that note

00:40:11.17 was what was the moment where you pieced that together I think I just reread it

00:40:16.21 that's all it took yeah sometimes you just need to sleep on something that's

00:40:21.07 fair I just remember that the article about I think it was like

00:40:26.08 like over 50000 cans or something 50

00:40:29.12 000. That's so many yeah wow but to be honest that's probably that'll probably

00:40:32.23 be edible for a while although or it would have rust rust

00:40:37.01 but I don't know maybe it'll rust open and

00:40:40.13 release oh god some wildlife can enjoy the technological advantage of canned

00:40:45.19 food it's the cycle of life that's a real that's a real thank me

00:40:50.19 later for the for the wildlife of the ocean

00:40:53.17 oh man speaking of thank me later did we talk about my thousand day puzzle idea

00:40:58.06 no no I had an idea the other day what if we sold a thousand piece puzzle but

00:41:03.01 you receive one piece a day in the mail randomly and so it takes a thousand days

00:41:07.18 to go to this I would be so annoyed create a puzzle

00:41:11.06 with the biggest carbon footprint possible yeah it could be well maybe be

00:41:16.13 local I'll you know maybe I'll deliver it on bicycle uh

00:41:20.13 like it could take a hundred days for you to get two pieces to fit together

00:41:24.21 how frustrating would that be oh I would be infuriated if you wanna talk about

00:41:28.20 such a [ __ ] you gift that's the worst that's way worse than the cursed socks I

00:41:34.08 would kill somebody if they gave me a 1

00:41:37.05 000 day puzzle one piece at a time it would have to be combined with like the

00:41:40.21 face zine or something where it'd be stapled to the front every week I had

00:41:44.06 that I had that idea except Emily showed me a tick tock of some dad who got his

00:41:47.15 daughter a puzzle for Christmas a thousand piece puzzle and when she

00:41:50.20 opened it up he had individually wrapped

00:41:52.19 all thousand pieces so she had to unwrap a thousand puzzle pieces and I thought

00:41:55.14 they're already wrapped you should just portion out how you send them.

00:41:58.21 [Applause]

00:42:00.10 [Laughter]

00:42:01.11 Hey oh man what an inconvenience what's the

00:42:05.02 worst what's the worst gift you've ever got that was not intended to be a bad

00:42:11.16 gift this is pointless the tiny bike tiny bike oh

00:42:15.18 the tiny bike I got yes yeah Geoff got me a tiny motorbike once I did it

00:42:20.12 he like arrived arrived home late one day uh just smashed into my bedroom woke

00:42:26.01 me up probably one one in the morning and just wheeled in this tiny little

00:42:30.10 micro motorcycle oh and then I was like thanks and then then the next day we

00:42:36.02 tried to use it and we pulled the little like engine start cord and it just

00:42:40.17 snapped we never got it it was a little hunk of

00:42:43.16 junk I bought it like I bought it off some dude drunk one night he was like

00:42:48.04 just bragging about he had this little bike and I was like I'll buy it and then

00:42:52.15 uh yeah I just love the idea of you being out at a bar

00:42:55.06 and you're like oh it's not like oh let me buy this gift for my kid it's like oh

00:42:59.02 let me get this gift for my 20 year old foreign roommate I'm

00:43:02.20 not putting Millie on that thing she was like sixth I thought it would be

00:43:06.19 ridiculous inappropriate something else I mean she

00:43:10.09 got something else it wasn't a binary decision it wasn't like well I could

00:43:14.12 give something to Gavin or my doc well it's gonna be together

00:43:17.15 it wasn't an either or okay that's like a double because I think I'd

00:43:21.12 be really excited when I saw the tiny bike that's a great surprise for it to

00:43:25.17 not work would be so disappointing I wonder if I have a picture of it in my

00:43:29.07 old bedroom I'll do you one better it's in a video

00:43:32.15 uh remember it is I think the breaking of it is yeah the things to do we used

00:43:36.11 to film these videos called things to do where we do like come up with like a

00:43:40.08 task to complete in a video game that was unintended right and and then we

00:43:44.17 would try to very very briefly we did that for years

00:43:47.18 but very briefly after we would try to recreate that task in real life in some

00:43:52.06 way and so we were trying to do something with the motorcycle and so we

00:43:55.09 definitely filmed it I don't know what the video would have been but I'll have

00:43:58.21 to see if I can yeah around the time we were like trying to throw a cabbage in a

00:44:00.08 bucket and yeah skyrim and then we would

00:44:02.20 do it in real life and throw to the next one that was fun that was fun it's a

00:44:06.13 great video now just look oh I found that I found the picture you can't see

00:44:11.05 can I see it I left that motorcycle under my old

00:44:14.07 house and as far as I know it's probably that's way cooler than I was expecting

00:44:20.06 that's [ __ ] awesome that looks like a yeah that was my uh bed for a while was

00:44:25.11 just a mattress on the floor I slept like that for a couple of years I think

00:44:29.18 and then uh and then I I think I had like six things in my life it was like

00:44:33.12 desk chair tv bed and then I got mobile you'll also notice that Gavin has

00:44:38.06 something leaning against his door so I can't bust in

00:44:41.16 yeah that was mainly because of uh poppins oh the dog because he because he

00:44:46.12 could open the door yeah and he just busted in at night so I had to put the

00:44:50.06 table against it yeah but you learned that if you like

00:44:53.20 that would stop the dog but you learn that if you kick the door hard enough it

00:44:57.22 would sling the table across the room so when we moved out of that place there

00:45:04.04 was a big like sheared off section of paint that went up the door

00:45:08.02 I forgot about that that's right yeah well I wasn't taking no for an answer in

00:45:11.20 those days yeah I never I didn't really have to dust

00:45:15.00 that room that much but I did have to sweep up the paint chips from around the

00:45:19.14 door oh man I was I gotta say good types I was not

00:45:23.11 looking forward to doing the podcast today but

00:45:26.12 I feel better now thanks for improving my mood guys I'm glad we could help yeah

00:45:31.07 I I'm so impressed with this this is an all-time buy by you Geoff you shouldn't

00:45:36.03 feel bad about this purchase this was a great purchase however much it cost it

00:45:40.12 was a great idea it was and it didn't I don't remember I think I paid like 500

00:45:44.14 bucks for it maybe uh that's fair that's a guess it's just a guess I it could be

00:45:49.20 wildly wrong but uh I had always intended to get it

00:45:52.20 fixed but you know in those days there was just so much happening and we were

00:45:56.13 doing so many different just like it fell by the wayside quickly you know and

00:46:00.00 you just never get it's kind of like it's kind of like face lore you know you

00:46:03.06 you leave a joke for two weeks and then suddenly it's been a year and a half and

00:46:06.11 you're like sure yeah right ping-pong balls orange ping-pong balls to say 19.

00:46:11.18 Yeah when we gonna use that ball generator to

00:46:14.23 bet on roulette and Vegas at some point I think so yeah I think that was the

00:46:19.16 plan I don't remember I still have a ball on my desk I have 48 I don't even

00:46:23.09 know if that was the one you guessed Geoff but I have 48 on my desk for some

00:46:27.13 reason I'm assuming that's why did you ever have that reminded me of um those

00:46:31.20 little like battery cars I always wanted

00:46:33.22 those as a kid I never got one you'd see the commercials for them where it like

00:46:37.02 looks like a fancy car but kids can drive them is that like the type of

00:46:41.18 speed like barbie yeah but but they had like other ones

00:46:44.23 they had like batman themed or whatever like they had they had all sorts I

00:46:48.04 always wanted one of those that was one of the gifts I never got as a kid I

00:46:51.17 wonder if that is the equivalent like the bike equivalent how fast were you

00:46:55.18 supposed to be able to go uh I think that thing went like 50 miles an

00:47:00.17 hour like at a ridiculously dangerous speed 50. That's insane yeah I remember

00:47:04.21 the guy telling me to be really careful on it because it goes way too fast

00:47:09.06 we gotta do tiny bike redemption we should get one that works

00:47:12.12 great let's do it I mean that thing is they make electric ones now I'm sure

00:47:15.17 they do I'm sure they do did you ever have one of those cars Gavin when you're

00:47:18.18 a kid do they have those in england yeah

00:47:21.05 I didn't have I didn't have one I didn't even that was such a like in my mind

00:47:25.12 that was such a rich kid gift I never bothered asking you know that's like

00:47:29.20 it's like it's like there's no point to even even ask

00:47:32.22 because it just like because I know I knew what the answer would be

00:47:35.14 immediately and then I would just feel bad

00:47:37.21 you know like there's some stuff as a kid you're like man totally or whatever

00:47:41.16 yeah yeah there's like as I as I said that was like for me the gift I always

00:47:44.18 wanted never got I don't think I ever asked for it I don't think that was ever

00:47:48.10 even a consideration on a list you just see the commercials be like that's

00:47:51.16 [ __ ] cool that looks awesome I remember always thinking that way about

00:47:54.14 whenever you'd see ads for I assume it worked like [ __ ] but like those kids

00:47:58.20 virtual reality games where you have a little gun and yeah and I always

00:48:02.15 remember thinking that's got to be the coolest thing but it's like one of the

00:48:06.15 yeah one of those things you don't even bother asking no it's like 200 quid did

00:48:10.19 you ever get did you ever get surprised as a kid by an awesome awesome gift and

00:48:15.12 then it turned like you weren't even expecting you didn't ask for it and then

00:48:19.11 it turned out to be [ __ ] suck for like reasons outside of your control

00:48:23.03 like when I was a kid laser tag happened um

00:48:26.00 you know we just went and played laser tag for your birthday gav right uh had a

00:48:30.03 blast well when laser tag like first hit the market as a product I was I don't

00:48:35.11 know maybe 10 or 11.

00:48:37.03 And like it I felt like every kid on earth had it like every kid in my school

00:48:41.15 had it but me everybody had it and it was like whatever I I was one of those

00:48:44.23 things where I just like it looked like it cost hundreds of dollars and so I

00:48:48.06 never even thought to ask but for Christmas my [ __ ] grandma got me

00:48:53.01 laser tag and she got my cousin Adam laser tag which was awesome except I

00:48:58.02 lived in Alabama and he lived in Florida and so

00:49:00.19 I had half of laser tag that for two weeks in the summer and on thanksgiving

00:49:05.23 and on Christmas I could play and the rest of the year I had to put the laser

00:49:10.18 tag receiver on my dog and then get her to run around the yard while I tried to

00:49:14.18 shoot at her because nobody else in my neighborhood even though somehow every

00:49:18.06 kid in school had it nobody in my neighborhood had it and so I had the

00:49:22.08 most useless badass [ __ ] gift that did no nothing

00:49:25.22 I like the idea of it being intense that

00:49:28.18 you both have to always be equipped with

00:49:30.16 the receiver at all times you just never know what an attack's going to happen

00:49:34.08 never expected he's just in class one day it just starts beeping and you you

00:49:38.00 came surprised that sucks yeah I was like you

00:49:41.18 just like staring at it in the bedroom you just like put it on the wall and

00:49:46.00 just lay in bed and just go.

00:49:49.21 [Music]

00:49:51.09 Or whatever and you're just like god damn it so so close to fun as a kid I

00:49:56.09 really wanted this clock because I've always been like kind of into like funny

00:49:59.11 clocks and it was one of those you know those pins you get like a set of pins

00:50:03.12 that you can like smush your face in and

00:50:05.14 it gives it leaves like an impression of your face and the pins yes it's a clock

00:50:08.16 that was made out of them so I assumed looking at the picture that the pins

00:50:12.08 would like slowly move out like shh and like make the time and I was like I

00:50:16.01 really want this clock and it was like quite a lot of money at the time so it

00:50:19.20 was my only present that year it was this new clock and I plugged it in and I

00:50:23.10 didn't realize but it it didn't like slowly move the pins they would they

00:50:26.21 would all be like and every time the minute would change you'd be like

00:50:31.20 that was in my room but it used to keep me up if I was like if I was in a light

00:50:37.03 sleep and it would go it would go from like 1159 to midnight all of the digits

00:50:42.10 be like oh I hate it but I don't want to not use it

00:50:48.02 that was probably my most disappointing one what's your what's your most

00:50:53.05 disappointing gift Andrew oh I'm trying to think I was always so bad at gifts I

00:50:57.07 remember it's not a gift story's like specific but you know how there's like

00:51:01.22 mall santas and that type of thing yeah I was with my friends and uh

00:51:05.14 we're like gonna go to a movie and there's a mall Santa there and we're

00:51:09.07 like oh you can go see sin and I still at the age where I believed in mol

00:51:12.15 santas I thought it was a real thing and I just remember having so much [ __ ]

00:51:15.20 anxiety in line trying to come up with a

00:51:18.02 gift idea to tell Santa that I would get at Christmas because I didn't know what

00:51:21.10 I wanted and I didn't want to ask for a [ __ ] thing I was like what do I want

00:51:24.16 what do I actually want do I want this because I I thought there was a

00:51:28.02 possibility that what I said in that moment would actually be my gift

00:51:31.02 and I came to the conclusion this is such I could come up with anything my

00:51:35.00 best option I came up with by the time I got to the front was the matrix on dvd

00:51:40.15 that was my great idea and I just remember as a kid telling mull Santa I

00:51:45.16 want the matrix on dvd and being so disappointed with myself that this is

00:51:49.13 like the best thing I could think of and that you'd send it all the way to

00:51:53.02 the top yeah I sent it all the way to the matrix on dvd never got it never got

00:51:57.12 the matrix on dvd never came I got a boat once and it popped

00:52:01.13 immediately on the first thing because I had this giant toy Godzilla to put a

00:52:06.21 hole in it that was a pretty bad gift I guess I only got one use out of it

00:52:10.21 what it was like a blow up boat it was a

00:52:12.22 boat yeah and my grandpa and I went in I was probably like six and we're like

00:52:17.01 paddling out and then immediately I had this big Godzilla toy from the Matthew

00:52:22.23 broader Godzilla movie I loved it as a kid

00:52:24.22 and it had all these sharp edges and it immediately put like a little hole in

00:52:28.20 the boat so it started to take on water and we had to go back and I never that

00:52:33.11 was the only inflatable boat I ever got I got to use it once for like 10 minutes

00:52:37.17 you couldn't patch it no I just I don't know I I was seven like it was in my

00:52:41.19 head it had a hole in it and then the adults dealt with whatever like it just

00:52:45.07 it was out of my life also like when I was a kid and I would get blow up stuff

00:52:48.12 it would always come with a little patch kit and that would be the first thing I

00:52:52.01 threw away I'd be like [ __ ] this I uh what you were describing with the

00:52:56.08 matrix that's how I feel and this is a relatively new development I wonder if

00:53:00.21 it's uh a sign of some sort of cognitive decline but uh that's how I feel at all

00:53:06.04 drive-throughs now when I have to look at the drive-through especially the

00:53:11.05 worst is taco bell it's like trying to decipher uh like sanskrit I like I can't

00:53:16.02 I see it all at once and I k all at the same time and I can't focus on any of

00:53:19.20 the thing and I never know what to order and the person's waiting and I get so

00:53:23.11 stressed out oh it's been like I just happened to be today it's brutal the

00:53:27.06 worst is have you ever gone back through a drive-through like you realize that

00:53:30.08 they forgot an item and then you have to loop back around and

00:53:33.19 that that kills me uh it's just so awkward yeah having to go back and

00:53:37.04 explain no I don't need to order something you forgot this thing oh you

00:53:40.22 didn't like it just it becomes a whole process I hate drive-throughs you're

00:53:44.04 terrible does it usually sure surely it happens quite a lot though and they're

00:53:48.06 not weird about it yeah it's just internal anxiety I uh right I ordered uh

00:53:53.05 this place called taco shack uh the other day this is maybe three months ago

00:53:57.05 now I got lunch for Emily and I I was out and uh I just called her and I was

00:54:00.19 like hey do you want me to pick some up for you and she was like yeah and she

00:54:04.04 told me what she wanted and so I went through the taco shack and I

00:54:08.08 paid for it and everything got the drinks and all got home

00:54:11.06 and came inside and gave her her drink and she goes where's the food and I was

00:54:14.19 like uh I guess I left it in the car so I went

00:54:17.21 to the car and there was no food in the car and I'd sit down and I was like I

00:54:22.12 think I just I think I just drove off without it

00:54:26.04 like I think I think they handed me the drinks and I left

00:54:29.19 and she was like well I guess you gotta go back and get it and I was like well

00:54:33.19 I'm certainly not gonna do that we'll just I'll just order something uh and so

00:54:37.14 she went she's like I'll do it and she drove over and got the food and they're

00:54:40.14 like yeah we thought that was real weird the guy just took off but here's your

00:54:43.22 favorite I was so embarrassed I couldn't do it I

00:54:46.21 didn't have happily buy food again dude somewhere I was just gonna buy I'm just

00:55:08.02 I enjoyed wraps up yeah that was fun yeah yeah yeah it was a good episode uh

00:55:13.10 114th I believe uh thanks for listening uh and if you uh wouldn't mind telling a

00:55:19.14 friend or a loved one or an acquaintance or maybe just a co-worker about our

00:55:25.04 little podcast and maybe convince them to listen to an episode or two I don't

00:55:29.16 know what a good one to start with would be a lot of people

00:55:32.14 I don't know well what's a good episode we should

00:55:34.23 I always see people ask like what's a good episode I could recommend a friend

00:55:36.17 to this one there you go Eric said yeah always start with the most recent and

00:55:40.22 then work your way backward uh that way you're learning a story backwards and

00:55:44.12 it's it's what what what if we made the ideal first

00:55:48.00 episode what if we just made that what if we made it remember can that be the

00:55:51.17 next episode we have to record one more I just make an ideal first episode I

00:55:55.16 don't think so I don't think so I think we need to yeah it's on the calendar we

00:55:59.01 already talked about it can you not do two I just got nothing for the next one

00:56:03.10 oh my god we do this everyone came into this one nothing I got nothing this is

00:56:07.18 ridiculous well we talked about a bike and a and I just doesn't even matter

00:56:19.22 faces I'm gonna I'm gonna say Andrew I love your idea I love your idea for the

00:56:24.08 ultimate first episode I think it's great but I think that to Eric I think

00:56:27.07 it's gonna take a little bit of prep on our part to figure out absolutely

00:56:29.05 perfect first episode would be we'll have to put our heads together and come

00:56:32.23 up with something I remember when we tried to make the best uh minute or two

00:56:38.02 minutes of all time I forgot about that that was great there's a huge danger of

00:56:43.20 us repeating that anyway tune in next week to find out uh

00:56:47.06 maybe it'll be a great first episode maybe it'll just be a regulation normal
