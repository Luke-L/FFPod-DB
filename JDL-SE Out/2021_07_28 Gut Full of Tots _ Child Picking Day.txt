00:00:41.16 me as always my constant companions Gavin free and Andrew panton hello

00:00:48.00 and not to be forgotten uh our uh sound engineer

00:00:51.09 nick and then Eric the producer those guys they're there too they matter so

00:00:55.23 please don't forget them leave them don't forget them in your

00:00:58.18 prayers every night when you go to bed and you pray for us and it's important

00:01:03.07 nick I feel like is gonna have a big role in this episode to an

00:01:06.17 extent I mean he automatically will because of one aspect

00:01:10.08 but we're gonna have to have some clarifications

00:01:14.01 I got a gut full of tots do you [Laughter]

00:01:18.08 I guess we should explain that right do we want to just immediately go into

00:01:23.06 yeah I think we should it's been it's been the highlight of the week between

00:01:27.05 recordings for sure we had an argument like a weirdly

00:01:31.01 I don't like just more of a bizarre I don't even know how to classify it

00:01:34.17 I'll be honest I'm blown away that Geoff is here today

00:01:38.21 that is true what happened in the slack this is my job

00:01:41.17 and I take my job extremely seriously I think I would argue I take my job more

00:01:46.03 seriously than anybody who works in our company

00:01:49.20 uh yeah I would agree so the idea that I would not show up

00:01:52.17 uh to do my job is uh is insulting well not insult in the context of you're

00:01:57.14 under protest right now uh I'm I'm protesting a specific bit on

00:02:02.03 the show but that doesn't preclude me from uh participating in the show uh

00:02:07.01 I won't be participating in that segment I've I've already treated an official

00:02:10.08 complaint and that's fine uh I'm more than but it's not my show it's our show

00:02:16.06 I'm merely uh trying a piece a wedge in the pie as it were so if you guys

00:02:21.03 want to do if you guys want to do that segment

00:02:24.07 right now I encourage you to do it and I will seed

00:02:27.21 the floor to you so you're selectively not showing up

00:02:31.12 no I'm here I just I I'm I can't contribute

00:02:34.11 to this segment but I'll sit here I'll listen what good are you if you're here

00:02:37.20 but you're not going to contribute to the show

00:02:40.04 I'm contributing to the show I can't contribute to this segment because I'm

00:02:43.09 protesting it but it's part of the show.

00:02:51.14 I just don't understand the protest we got to get into it Andrew

00:02:56.07 where did this begin uh well this began with you it's sort of

00:03:00.04 as mentioned when you were telling your fly stories several episodes ago you've

00:03:04.21 been re-watching breaking bad I have and there is uh an intro I

00:03:08.17 believe to one of the episodes where a character is eating a bunch of dipping

00:03:12.02 sauces yeah you sort of reveal the uh the boss

00:03:15.01 behind the main boss of the previous season

00:03:18.15 is yes the company called madrigal in Germany and the episode opens with a guy

00:03:23.18 tucking into some honey mustard I just took a picture of the screen and said

00:03:28.21 it's Andrew and I just said is this your favorite scene from

00:03:33.05 because he's been on a honey mustard tear recently I don't

00:03:36.06 I mean it's just come up naturally quite a bit I don't feel like I'm on a tear I

00:03:39.14 don't feel like I've been excessive about it

00:03:41.23 just it's there have been windows to talk about it and it has come up

00:03:46.01 but it extended so Gavin sent me that and then we were I don't know how we got

00:03:49.10 on the subject of it but we're talking about like

00:03:52.03 ideal dipping sauces and if you were making a sauce because they made a sauce

00:03:56.00 called french for breaking bad and so we're talking

00:03:59.03 about like what would be your mix and it just turned into a thing of oh we

00:04:03.04 should make sauces we did a salad thing last week

00:04:06.01 we could do a condiment thing this week it'd be kind of like a

00:04:09.10 fun dumb thing or whatever yeah so we got into a conversation of

00:04:12.02 what's the best condiment and then we got into this whole other thing of like

00:04:16.00 well what we need to know what's being used with

00:04:18.18 the condiment because like a burger sauce is different yeah like a nug

00:04:22.19 dipping sauce and uh I was talking about tots at one point and

00:04:27.05 we eventually settled on we're to be dipping tots into this condiment

00:04:31.01 yeah well we want you wanted to make something specifically for

00:04:34.14 tot so then I said I wanted to make something I didn't want to make a

00:04:38.08 completely different sauce item so I figured I'd make that we could both make

00:04:42.20 our sauces and because it was like a goofy fun thing we opened it up to

00:04:46.17 everybody and uh it was a mistake apparently

00:04:51.03 well should we read through what the uh what the people's sources were

00:04:55.23 uh we we could do that or do you want to first go through the protest and how we

00:04:59.20 got to that point well I feel like if we read through all of the submitted

00:05:05.05 sources ending in Geoff's okay we'll repeal the protest okay

00:05:10.07 that's fair nick submitted base ketchup about two ounces

00:05:14.08 one squirt dijon mustard one squirt mayo two dashes

00:05:18.01 of Louisiana hot sauce I actually submitted my first so mine was just a

00:05:22.21 very basic combination I didn't really go too much into it mine was in ratios

00:05:27.20 mine was two-thirds ketchup one-third horseradish

00:05:31.12 and then a little splash of lemon Andrews was two teaspoons of hot sauce one

00:05:37.01 teaspoon barbecue sauce one teaspoon honey mustard one teaspoon ketchup

00:05:42.00 one teaspoon maple syrup half teaspoon red chili flakes

00:05:45.16 and I I should point out that he originally wrote

00:05:48.11 one eighth teaspoon of pineapple juice I was like at that point you're into

00:05:54.15 drops just a teardrop you might as well write 380 fourths of a cup of

00:06:00.02 pineapple juice yeah you upped it to a one-half teaspoon of pineapple juice

00:06:05.20 I did okay then we get onto Geoff's submission

00:06:09.11 well Geoff technically submitted two and I will say that

00:06:13.00 that there's some confusion mainly over his first submission

00:06:17.16 okay this is the one I've got in front of me okay

00:06:19.20 sprinkle hot sauce with light dusting of chili powder

00:06:23.22 you've already got it wrong you said hot sauce I said hot pots

00:06:28.00 sprinkles you can't even you can't even make me all right let me I've got sauce

00:06:34.13 sprinkle hot tots with a light dusting of chili powder

00:06:39.11 it won't take much then combine shredded pepper jack cheese

00:06:43.18 with crisped up cube pancetta hard sauteed diced onions and some thin sliced

00:06:49.05 chives and coat the tots done that sounds delicious my problem when I read that

00:06:56.06 a wonderful site it's a great side item I wasn't sure where the sauce was in

00:07:01.16 there I didn't see the condiment in there it was yeah I actually read

00:07:06.19 them all out to meg and I read Jess and she was like come on

00:07:14.05 Wikipedia lists under condiments cheese I then modified

00:07:21.09 because you guys mentioned that it didn't sound like a condiment I modified

00:07:25.12 it I replaced the shredded cheese with nacho cheese which I would also point

00:07:31.06 out is listed as an official condiment under the condiment section of Wikipedia

00:07:36.12 I would also like to read the definition of the

00:07:40.02 [ __ ] word condiment from Miriam Webster definition of condiment

00:07:45.01 something used to enhance the flavor of a [ __ ] food now allow me to read

00:07:50.03 the definition of condiment from dictionary. Fucking calm

00:07:54.02 something used to give a special flavor to food as mustard ketchup salt or

00:07:59.03 spices let me then read the definition of condiment from the Cambridge

00:08:03.18 [ __ ] dictionary which listed as a substance

00:08:07.01 such as salt that you add to a food to improve

00:08:10.13 its taste then let me read to you from Gordon ramsay's cumberland sauce recipe

00:08:18.04 which he lists as maybe you've heard of cumberland sauce Gavin you're British I

00:08:23.03 haven't but he read he lists it as a popular holiday

00:08:27.22 condiment that then includes vegetable oil minced onions currant jelly

00:08:32.21 two oranges lemon red wine orange juice lemon juice black pepper brown sugar dry

00:08:39.05 mustard cayenne pepper ground ginger all reduced together

00:08:43.16 that seems pretty complicated and requires some cooking then let me read

00:08:49.11 an article I read on the kitchen.com about how condiments

00:08:52.06 aren't a one size fit fits all item and they

00:08:54.21 they went ahead and they interviewed some of the best chefs in the world I'm

00:08:59.01 gonna pull from buried to cake the chef at scotch prime in the palms

00:09:03.07 resort casino who says I truly feel condiments are more than just the

00:09:07.03 average ketchup mustard relish and mayo as a chef I like being creative and

00:09:11.11 making different sauces for topping sandwiches flavored aiolis house-made

00:09:15.07 steak sauces pickled shallot relishes creamy mustards

00:09:19.12 and new spins on ketchup like scotch infused I also love

00:09:23.14 creamy avocado dressing and seasoned hummus make it smooth

00:09:26.20 make it chunky you're the chef the sky is the limit with condiments I thought I

00:09:32.00 was the chef but I guess I'm [ __ ] not I just like that your instructions start

00:09:37.16 with put powder on the tots yeah it's a it's a weird combination

00:09:42.05 it's it's so I think you have some points Geoff I think you just worded your

00:09:47.03 initial recipe terribly it was confusing to read I wasn't sure

00:09:51.05 where the sauce was this also just reads like a side like diced

00:09:55.14 like are you I didn't understand if you were reducing it or if you were

00:09:59.07 putting this on as a topping was sort of my initial

00:10:02.07 reaction to it I think this sounds delicious it sounds very

00:10:06.15 good too we just took an issue with the format and um

00:10:10.13 it resulted in Geoff storming out of the slack channel you know we were hitting

00:10:16.01 him pretty hard on the way out at one point I said I would like to

00:10:20.10 change my condiment my second condiment is an egg Benedict and then he left.

00:10:27.09 I think what you submitted Geoff would be a side version of the tater tots dish

00:10:32.19 like you have your base tater tots and then you pay a dollar fifty

00:10:36.09 and it comes with what you've added to it I don't think this is a base

00:10:39.14 condiment even if you let's say argue that it is I

00:10:43.16 don't think it's within the spirit of what we all submitted

00:10:47.04 I think you went very gourmet I took a picture of all three sources and they

00:10:50.13 would all fit in a little plastic you know like like

00:10:54.12 your mcdonald's sources that you've got they would all fit in there I just don't

00:11:01.05 know how you so the people at home know Geoff is disconnected

00:11:06.08 I don't he just quit he just he just quit

00:11:14.17 because I was going to eventually get to a point where I think Geoff

00:11:19.13 was in the right to an extent I think his first recipe

00:11:23.18 is absurd but I think once he clarified it to cheese sauce

00:11:28.07 uh I think that's a fair submission he's going off just

00:11:31.19 not not really within the spirit I think he's off the grid now

00:11:35.02 I think this was the thing that drove him to go like live in the woods this is

00:11:38.19 it we did it I think pushed him over the edge and we didn't even know we were

00:11:42.01 doing it you have to text them you guys have somebody has to text them

00:11:46.17 look we have to all these sauces were made sauce seems good

00:11:51.08 I made three sauces I'm excited to try them I got my tater tots

00:11:54.04 uh-huh have you have you got it already you gotta try it live I've pre-tried

00:11:57.05 mine and I already have my verdict but I just

00:12:00.08 I feel like Geoff's wouldn't fit in a little plastic pot

00:12:03.01 well yeah it's mostly because it wasn't a sauce yeah like it's not it

00:12:06.21 the tots are in there even if it did like storing a cheese sauce in a

00:12:10.22 container seems complicated I'm not sure like the logistics of like it not just

00:12:14.23 hardening I don't know how you do that unless you

00:12:17.10 like completely manipulate the sauce to the point where it's

00:12:20.08 no longer cheese so do you want to do you want to try them live now in the

00:12:23.11 episode yeah I figured that's what we do I haven't tried

00:12:27.15 I'm interested to hear your your process with this should we get

00:12:32.15 Geoff back he just texted me and he said my discord died

00:12:35.20 and I said do you have internet I mean he did go offline I feel like the

00:12:40.11 comic value comes from just leaving the core

00:12:44.00 if he actually got kicked out of the recording

00:12:47.02 at that time it's absolutely perfect it is a hell of a coincidence

00:12:53.11 um I did not expect this episode to go like this

00:12:57.09 no like he like can't get in he sent me a movie

00:13:00.19 of just discord spinning and checking so we do a 10 count that just like

00:13:07.16 agrees with us unless you can get it here 10 seconds like a wrestling thing

00:13:11.07 he's out of the ring right now yeah 10 seconds at this point oh he's

00:13:15.17 back oh he's back all right I'm back sorry I lost my internet

00:13:20.04 how much money would it cost to make yours Geoff that's a great question

00:13:25.13 I feel like it's like 15 bucks worth of ingredients

00:13:29.09 I didn't realize there was a price limit on how much did I

00:13:33.05 know I'm on Geoff's side I want Geoff's side with that question

00:13:36.06 that that doesn't have anything to do with a recipe I mean if you had to buy

00:13:40.03 all of the ingredients if you had to buy all of the ingredients that Andrew just

00:13:43.22 listed it would cost more than nacho cheese and pancetta

00:13:48.15 I guarantee you that he had like nine [ __ ] ingredients

00:13:52.04 by the way have you guys ever read the ingredients like you were acting like it

00:13:55.05 was over complicated have you ever read the ingredients of [ __ ] ketchup

00:13:59.12 there's like 11 ingredients in ketchup alone you idiot

00:14:02.17 so first of all I I was I was confused by it I never said it was bad I've gone

00:14:06.12 as far I've said multiple times what you submitted sounds delicious I

00:14:11.03 just wasn't sure if it was in the spirit of what was said

00:14:15.01 I also just didn't understand the first part

00:14:17.01 where I need to I will apologize to you I missed the nacho cheese sauce comment

00:14:21.12 I was I was just baffled by the complexity of the sauce but I made a thing

00:14:27.06 yesterday because sauce is confusing I made a

00:14:30.03 gram I know we could have a conversation about how we feel about this

00:14:34.06 cheese sauce I think fits in the criteria of dipping sauce

00:14:38.00 uh it's just it was complicated so you have different tiers of sauce you

00:14:41.15 have your dressings you have your sauce and you have your dipping sauce

00:14:44.20 I think cheese sauce falls under the category of a mix between a sauce and a

00:14:49.07 dipping sauce I think your recipe is valid I was just

00:14:53.00 confused by the presentation as a strange it was a strange interaction I'd say

00:14:58.02 hey Geoff Geoff when you said sprinkle cheese on the tater tots did you think

00:15:01.15 this is where it was gonna go no I was trying to make a delicious

00:15:05.17 sauce that maybe I was trying to think outside the boss and

00:15:08.21 or outside the box and do a cheese based sauce I thought that would be

00:15:12.01 interesting a lot of people when they eat tater tots they like to have like

00:15:16.15 cheddar cheese and bacon and all that stuff on it and I thought

00:15:19.12 why not uh do the plused-up version of bacon and cut up tiny little chunks of

00:15:24.17 pancetta crisp them up and then mix them in with

00:15:28.13 the cheese with a little chili flavoring and some minced onions

00:15:33.03 that are also sauteed much like a chutney which is considered a condiment

00:15:37.07 it's an official condiment it's a chunky chutney of cheese is what I had

00:15:41.15 created that I thought was very in the spirit uh of certainly in the dictionary

00:15:46.18 definition of condiment and at one point Andrew

00:15:49.22 even said I think it sounds delicious but what you've described is not a

00:15:52.21 condiment it's a sauce so then I had to explain to him so he

00:15:56.00 obviously understood it as a sauce so then I had to prove to him

00:15:59.20 that a sauce is a condiment and that's when he realized he had no leg to stand

00:16:03.03 on well it's just I just don't feel like it fit the spirit

00:16:07.21 of what we were doing it's like realized that the spirit of what we were doing

00:16:11.23 was to combine the hard work of the heinz corporation

00:16:15.22 with the hard work of the french's corporation and then call it our thing

00:16:21.09 I tried to create I tried to actually create

00:16:23.19 with a real ingredients a condiment I didn't try to combine

00:16:27.08 two [ __ ] things that have logos on them that are already

00:16:30.09 that were already made in a lab by scientists into two other things into

00:16:33.23 one other thing and then go look I invented some [ __ ]

00:16:36.23 to be fair and you don't have context for this this was all started because of

00:16:40.05 France which is literally just french dress yeah

00:16:42.16 the original question was which uh which condiments would you mix together to

00:16:45.22 make the like the ultimate condiment yeah that's not what was presented to me

00:16:51.08 we don't think we left that out of the interest I think we did I think that was

00:16:54.20 the context that was maybe lacking we were all thinking within that that

00:16:58.14 framework and you came in with something very gourmet

00:17:01.03 I still don't think it's a sauce I think it's a side it's a side dish that you

00:17:04.06 made it's like it's coleslaw salad I think technically is a salad but you don't

00:17:09.09 view it as a salad but it is technically a salad I think it's the

00:17:12.22 same type of thing technically you're technically correct

00:17:16.19 but technically correct is the only correct I'm

00:17:19.15 correct in the only sense I will say that if you came to me and you said uh

00:17:24.12 and I came to you and I said I would like you to design

00:17:26.23 the what you think is the best salad and then you came back to me with coleslaw

00:17:30.13 and said it's a salad and I said you are correct it is a salad and if

00:17:34.08 that's what you think is the best salad then that meets the letter of the terms

00:17:38.13 of the comp a competition that we had how we going back to Andrew making salads

00:17:44.15 I I don't well it's the coleslaw comparison

00:17:46.17 yeah yeah I will say like I s I where I screwed up Geoff as I missed the nacho

00:17:50.10 cheese line on your second recipe submission your

00:17:54.02 first second recipe what was that that was in our text chain right there

00:17:58.20 yeah I don't have that text I don't think that came through on my I don't know

00:18:04.02 I never know what we're talking about in our text

00:18:07.09 that text into fear anyway I I I surmise that you guys have created each

00:18:12.02 other's sauces and are now going to test them to determine which is the best one

00:18:16.04 I think that's a great bit for this show we are

00:18:19.14 hammering the food stuff really hard the

00:18:21.14 audience is loving it I'm loving it so I without further ado I think you guys

00:18:26.02 should dive right in let's get saucy let's get condimental

00:18:30.03 you guys did all the hard work of buying

00:18:31.22 two things and then mixing them together with a spoon I don't want the audience

00:18:36.06 to miss out on that joy let's find out no the [ __ ] thrill of combining a

00:18:41.08 salad out of a mixer that was that was exciting that's as exciting as mixing

00:18:44.23 sauces it's the same I don't understand how

00:18:48.02 this is different than the salad thing I will say try my sauce it's not very

00:18:51.20 good I wouldn't put my sauce very high all right are you eating this I'm eating

00:18:57.07 the sauces right now I'm trying them it's I'm sorry it's all this

00:19:01.12 and you the first thing you do after you eat your sauces you just go yeah mine

00:19:06.06 sucked yeah it's not very good I mean I passed

00:19:08.22 the torch to you guys to let you run with

00:19:10.16 it and that's what that's what you did you immediately [ __ ] on your sauce

00:19:14.06 I don't know what to do for you guys nyx sauce is delicious

00:19:17.13 I like nick's sauce quite a bit nick you made a great sauce okay so you've tried

00:19:21.02 yours and you've tried nyx I've tried nicks and yeah mine I try

00:19:25.03 yours Gavin I don't know about yours Gavin

00:19:28.17 I'm I'm a little nervous I discovered I made a discovery with mine

00:19:33.08 oh [ __ ] this is this sucks this is way worse your size is terrible

00:19:38.04 oh my god so I accidentally made I made like

00:19:41.22 prawn cocktail sauce I made like shrimp cocktail dipping sauce

00:19:46.12 it's exactly the same I didn't realize what I was making it sounded good in my

00:19:51.05 head and then I was like oh this isn't a I'm not holding a shrimp

00:19:55.23 I've got a tart and it's weird uh nyx was in my opinion phenomenal

00:20:00.13 next one was great it was like a professional source yours Andrew

00:20:04.20 was I I rated yours even below mine I would not put mine below yours I would

00:20:11.20 say yours this is the difference between our sauces

00:20:16.02 they're both bad there's a version of my sauce that's good it's just not what it

00:20:21.08 is there's a combination there that you could find I think there's a balance

00:20:24.17 where that could be a decent sauce yours is what it is I don't think

00:20:28.21 there's any balancing of like the ingredients you have that would adjust

00:20:32.19 beyond the sauce that it is yours um I think the syrup is wrecking yours in

00:20:37.17 my opinion it could I didn't know how to like I was trying it that was the

00:20:40.23 journey of like not not knowing how to make sauce just being

00:20:44.12 an idiot and just being like I don't like how this tastes what can I do to

00:20:47.11 balance this in a different way and just constantly adding more stuff

00:20:50.22 for me yours had the the uh it had a consistency issue too it was a bit more

00:20:54.21 watery liquidy yeah it was is definitely the most liquidy of them all nick

00:20:59.05 definitely made the best sauce which I think should be expected um can I ask

00:21:04.00 can I ask a hypothetical of course um hypothetically uh take it removing nick

00:21:09.01 sauce from the situation just um just using the three hosts as their sauces

00:21:14.02 if you were to also make Geoff sauce where do you think it would have ranked

00:21:18.17 compared to uh your two sauces uh probably

00:21:21.18 at the top number one yeah I'd say that Geoff's would be the best

00:21:26.18 thing it just yeah by far I never said it wasn't delicious

00:21:31.03 we'll never know did you know that no I was boy kidding boycotting the

00:21:35.07 contest I wasn't given the other sauces to make so I wasn't going to make just

00:21:38.08 mine well I was just wondering if you'd like pre-tested it if you'd be no I I

00:21:43.02 invented it on the spot I had never uh never considered the

00:21:46.08 putting those ingredients together before it was uh it was a it was a I

00:21:52.10 in created for the the moment I'm gonna try to make Geoff sauce

00:24:27.16 episode all right

00:24:31.07 what about outside of sauce Geoff Geoff and I

00:24:35.09 I thought I felt like Geoff and I had a really good friendship weekend

00:24:40.14 did we I did I felt that way I felt we were uh Geoff was uh away oh you know

00:24:45.12 what I'm sorry I have been so blinded by by condiment rage and indignation I

00:24:51.12 forgot we had a lovely we had a great friendship weekend we had a lovely

00:24:57.18 correspondence wild weekend you are 100

00:25:00.21 right and I apologize we uh hockey we we gambled we watched

00:25:04.21 sports it was fun we hadn't watched like a basketball game together in a while

00:25:08.12 that was great Geoffy like on the phone with each other

00:25:11.05 yeah we're like texting back and forth yeah Geoff like had a whole bedding sheet

00:25:15.01 and like coffee beds we were in it together it was fun

00:25:18.01 you know I don't I don't gamble and I certainly don't drink anymore but I do

00:25:22.23 love las Vegas for the shows and for the spectacle and I do like to

00:25:26.12 bet on sports my girlfriend likes to bet on sports

00:25:29.13 and so uh this weekend we went to Vegas I did a bunch of stuff I got to go to a

00:25:33.00 I got to go to a tom cigar a comedy show

00:25:35.10 I got to go to the new meow wolf but the the big thing for me

00:25:38.21 was sitting in the sports book and betting on the hockey game you know boy

00:25:44.04 did I lose money and uh betting on the the betting on this uh on the east

00:25:49.12 or the wcf uh and uh which I won a bunch of money on

00:25:53.06 and then uh betting on horses I had a run I won

00:25:56.13 I correctly bet the winner four out of five horse races

00:26:00.06 [ __ ] yeah I was I was on fire I will say that the hockey bet was

00:26:03.18 great because Geoff just sent me what his bet was and he's like how do you feel

00:26:06.22 about this and I was like I love this bet

00:26:09.20 this is a great bet it's because I feel great about this event

00:26:13.10 and that's what I do I was [ __ ] my luck yeah

00:26:16.09 I accidentally put Geoff in a terrible position or though I did with basketball

00:26:20.12 both days I did I [ __ ] you on both days I apologize but I was like this is

00:26:24.12 a great bet I love it Montreal at home I feel like

00:26:27.22 they're not gonna get swept and I was right they would win one home game but

00:26:31.16 it was just the wrong one within like 10 seconds of the game they

00:26:36.10 score a goal tampa scores on Montreal Geoff's immediately down I felt bad

00:26:40.12 I think by what they scored two goals within like the first five minutes of

00:26:43.11 the game yeah and andrew's going it's okay 2-0 is the worst lead to have

00:26:48.06 they're bound to come back it's like a cliche in hockey that statistically

00:26:52.12 isn't at all true but it's like yeah 2-0

00:26:54.09 most dangerous lead and then they would score another and be like oh now they're

00:26:58.00 really in trouble 3-0

00:26:59.05 you don't want that it's a terrible lead it was brutal there's hope

00:27:02.07 there's hope for a little bit and it quickly faded but then it bounced back I

00:27:05.13 don't know like when the horse racing run

00:27:06.21 kicked off I don't know when you got hot but that was the next day it was the

00:27:10.12 next day yeah okay did you have a like a scheme

00:27:14.02 for hor like what was your strategy for horse racing

00:27:17.22 uh you know uh listen a successful a successful horse man

00:27:21.14 uh is only successful is only as successful as the secrets he keeps I can't

00:27:27.01 I can't we need a shocking what's a whole no a horseman is a man who bets on

00:27:31.03 the horses if I let my tactics get out then

00:27:33.07 everybody's to use them then the whole the whole horse industry might change

00:27:37.01 so I kind of I got to keep some stuff a little close to the vest fair enough

00:27:41.02 we then uh I put Geoff in a real dilemma Gavin when we bet basketball

00:27:45.12 because I am a amazing loser I am fantastic at losing

00:27:49.16 sports bets and do you expect to lose uh yeah yeah I do I I go in

00:27:54.19 when I make a bet on a sporting event it's not about making money

00:27:59.13 it's about the pain of later like it's the the hope and pain I'm really paying

00:28:03.13 for the experience of disappointment uh mainly and so Geoff sent me this list

00:28:08.06 of like nine or ten bets that he made and my

00:28:10.20 first comment was there's no way these all lose which is

00:28:15.03 horrible jinx but it's just how I felt at the time

00:28:17.07 then I even screwed him further though because I was gonna

00:28:20.12 match his bets and take all of his bets and I said if you want I can

00:28:24.09 fade you because I always lose so if I bet the opposite of you

00:28:28.04 that might increase your odds of winning but at this point I've jinxed you so I

00:28:32.15 don't know what's worse and uh Geoff just chose the great option

00:28:37.01 of he wants us all to sink if we're sinking he wants so I matched his bets yep

00:28:41.06 and it was positive we won more than we lost on those bets

00:28:44.15 yeah you know what they say a sinking tide lowers all ships that's how I feel

00:28:50.08 uh but it's not about winning you know it was you know those are ten dollar

00:28:55.01 five dollar bets it's not like it's real money oh I had

00:28:58.13 yeah mine was ten cents per per nba bet but I was like

00:29:01.03 I think mine were five dollar bets but uh

00:29:03.18 it's more just like the fun of doing it and just like and honestly half of

00:29:06.15 the reason why I like to do it is to sit in that like sports room with all the

00:29:10.10 tvs and just watch the [ __ ] weirdos that come in

00:29:14.00 like it is it's like a bus station in there just the people that

00:29:18.11 meander through it's it's interesting cross-section of humanity

00:29:22.12 so I I've never been on horses but I feel like my

00:29:26.05 my horse betting philosophy would be the same as my child picking

00:29:30.15 philosophy for the child kicking fluffy child

00:29:33.17 picking not child care I've never kissed the child you said

00:29:36.20 I've never kicked the child I never would but my

00:29:40.15 did you hear that yeah man that's that was close to an admission

00:29:43.15 no it wasn't even close I said picking it was very clear you can hear on my

00:29:46.23 audio distinctly clear child picking today is

00:29:50.06 one of my favorite days of the year it is like a holiday to me this is the day

00:29:54.04 I'm so excited this is child picking day yesterday was child picking day Geoff

00:29:59.05 this is the event for the child picking today

00:30:02.23 is scripps national spelling bee what a time

00:30:06.03 what an exciting process I watch it every year

00:30:09.08 it's how my fantasy football league determines our draft order

00:30:12.18 so everybody picks a kid there was a whole process

00:30:15.20 I didn't get my number one on the board I was outraged about it I was very

00:30:19.01 pissed I got my number two though so I believe I got some hope

00:30:23.01 but tonight is the spelling bee and so the order in which the kids are

00:30:27.03 eliminated determine the picking order for our league

00:30:29.23 so tonight it'll I'll be in a group chat with 11 other people who are all in

00:30:33.20 their 30s adults being irrationally furious at kid spelling cannot wait

00:30:38.17 it's one of my favorite days uh the oldest the oldest you can be for scripps

00:30:43.04 national spelling bee is 14 years old most of them are like 12. So it's like

00:30:46.22 all these adults just angrily watching 12 year olds trying to

00:30:50.08 spell so where are you in the uh the kicking order uh what do

00:30:54.15 you what do you mean in the kicking order the picky order picking order

00:31:00.12 no no I'm here I'm here well I picked a child named vincia wasn't who I wanted

00:31:07.01 what I was getting to at the point I feel like

00:31:10.06 I really wanted I forget his name there's one child who was sponsored by

00:31:14.23 the Carolina panthers which I've never seen before

00:31:17.04 there's always like another spelling bee or a newspaper there's one guy that's

00:31:21.09 just like no Carolina panthers and since we're doing a fantasy football thing

00:31:26.10 it's like this is destiny gotta go with that can can we sponsor

00:31:30.14 a such a great idea I don't know how that works I'd love to

00:31:35.02 that'd be great that we must be able to try and do that how do

00:31:38.08 I'll have to look into this but we save up our weekly episode budget like pocket

00:31:42.06 money by next year we might have enough

00:31:46.00 feel like we are the the coins that fall in the couch of like the overall

00:31:52.08 that's the budget like whatever coins happen to fall through

00:31:56.18 whatever sh whatev assuming the person that we pick

00:32:00.09 doesn't win whatever word they misspell to get out on we should just make that a

00:32:03.22 shirt oh absolutely a misspelled shirt that's how we re that's how we recoup

00:32:08.19 our investments

00:32:12.23 uh well I'd recoup it just personally enjoy I guess it's not my investment but

00:32:18.07 the word is condiment the word is honey mustard it's two words

00:32:23.03 that is true that is that was a bad example it's a terrible example

00:32:28.01 but it's great I would recommend you both

00:32:31.05 watch the scripts national spelling bee how on earth do I watch that

00:32:35.14 it's on ESPN I got like by television to see that

00:32:39.01 I guess yeah do you have no television watching options

00:32:42.02 no okay well then I guess I don't know how you'd watch it but

00:32:45.10 maybe if you watch it you could just I'll live text you yeah

00:32:49.14 yeah I'll just I'll keep you updated on how the [ __ ] is doing

00:32:53.04 that's my evening how about you guys uh what what are we gonna what am I gonna

00:32:57.01 do tonight yeah like what well just what's happening oh well

00:33:01.20 I'm very defeated today Geoff well listen it's been a week and it's it's

00:33:06.12 been a day uh tonight I'm gonna go host first night uh for rtx oh [ __ ]

00:33:12.09 yeah that's exciting as soon as I'm done here I'm gonna go do that

00:33:16.15 so yay that's great what about you Gavin I'm playing board games

00:33:22.12 yay what board games are you playing bye what what

00:33:29.01 this episode is just so weird and you asked what board games are you playing

00:33:33.16 and you just yeah you just said bye playing pandemic

00:33:37.07 I've never played that game I haven't either

00:33:41.14 have you played it before yeah we I've started

00:33:45.01 like a legacy we're like two rounds in I don't know what that means

00:33:49.12 yeah it's a co-op game it's like teamwork it's good it's good so far

00:33:53.17 are you a board game guy I'm becoming a board game guy

00:33:57.11 I feel like I've only recently discovered that board games can be

00:34:00.14 like video games in in the way that they're interested

00:34:03.13 because I think in board games I just think of like monopoly and mouse trap

00:34:06.22 and [ __ ] and it's just like oh yeah no they're better than there's some

00:34:10.10 good stuff out there there's some stuff that takes like

00:34:13.14 12 hours to finish and stuff over like multiple segments

00:34:16.10 are you shooting on clue clue is a great board game

00:34:19.12 you're feeling monopolies you think you don't think clue's a great board game

00:34:23.03 it's a murder mystery I I hate that game what do you hate

00:34:27.05 about oh you get a notepad you can ask questions that's great

00:34:29.16 blue is never as fun as it promises to be it's frustrating I I want clue to be

00:34:33.12 better every time I play it's a game where the box looks more interesting

00:34:37.01 than the game yeah I do okay I had a pretty cool clue boxes made out of wood

00:34:42.15 so I don't know if that's a fair comparison it was a pretty sweet box

00:34:46.07 it'd be tough for any game to live up to the design of the box

00:34:50.02 I had for clue Geoff do you remember the the English name for clue

00:34:54.13 clue do action Plato and then listen by the way I don't mean

00:34:57.15 I'm not talking [ __ ] about clue but I am acknowledging the limitations of clue

00:35:01.08 I'm a fan of clue I consider myself a cl a cluniac as we call ourselves

00:35:05.13 I even you know I've been trying to get a clue tentpole

00:35:08.15 show like hardcore monopoly hardcore clue made at roosty for years

00:35:11.22 but I have to agree with Gavin that it is uh it under delivers

00:35:15.19 when you sit down to play it I don't you know what I think it is is I haven't

00:35:20.13 ventured into like the actual complex adult board games

00:35:23.08 like the more pant the pandemics of the world I haven't I haven't played that

00:35:28.02 I'm I'm really like restricted to monopoly the classic favorites

00:35:31.10 like my comparables is like candy land is [ __ ] but my peak is something like

00:35:35.03 clue so I just think I I have a narrow range

00:35:38.12 sounds like we need to get you involved we need to have a board game night when

00:35:41.19 we go up to Canada maybe that'll be the reward if we can

00:35:44.21 find your front door man the list of [ __ ] we've got to do when we arrive in

00:35:48.19 Canada is getting really long yeah we're going to be very busy maybe while

00:35:54.12 maybe while like the bondo is drying on our bathtub [Music]

00:35:58.17 we could hammer out a game a clue is that on again this year

00:36:03.14 oh it happened I think it was last month it happens in July typically but

00:36:08.21 it would be weird if you know everything has been shut down here so I'd be

00:36:12.04 surprised maybe next year maybe 2022 is a bathroom

00:36:15.09 it's going to have to be next year because I feel like the audience alerted

00:36:19.11 me to the fact that it happened already uh famous nanaimo battle brace canceled

00:36:24.08 on June 5th 2021 did they also cancel the cheese rolling didn't you like pick

00:36:27.18 the cheese or something I did yes there was a whole cheese thing

00:36:31.10 that was season one that's the only thing that yeah that never happened sadly I

00:36:35.20 think I think we should go to that at some point we should go to cheese rolling

00:36:39.10 should we sponsor a cheese could could that be like the later thing

00:36:42.22 is this evolution of your face we just start sponsoring things to see the [ __ ]

00:36:46.02 face logo tumbling down a hill yeah I think we gotta slowly build to like an

00:36:51.20 actual fast sport like we're gonna start with the cheese and then we're gonna go

00:36:57.20 to the bathtub race and then maybe eventually

00:37:00.03 I don't know a car sponsor and then we've got the face sponsored kid

00:37:04.07 I think we should just sponsor the weirdest stuff I would love that

00:37:08.10 there's nothing I love more than like getting into a thing that I know nothing

00:37:11.11 about especially if I can gamble on it like Russian handball

00:37:16.00 yeah like handball was like such a fun two weeks of like getting in I've never

00:37:19.14 watched it again I followed the Brazilian goalie on twitter because

00:37:22.15 their performance was amazing ridiculously talented I'll never think

00:37:26.07 about handball again but yeah if we could get into weird sports I'm

00:37:31.03 all about it I got a question for you guys okay as of today I now have

00:37:37.11 uh 100 full-size baseball bats 900 bat knobs on my kitchen table for

00:37:44.10 some reason and a thousand little metal tags wait you got

00:37:48.23 900 you have no I haven't and I ask you guys

00:37:52.04 what the [ __ ] am I supposed to do with all this stuff I genuinely don't

00:37:56.15 remember where did the 900 knobs come from I saw

00:38:01.00 I don't know I don't know why the knobs ended up at my house

00:38:03.16 I was thinking about that yesterday when I was dragging them in from the front

00:38:06.21 porch because I don't know that I was ever supposed to do anything with them

00:38:11.03 if you've already got knobs why are you cutting up bats well I think the point

00:38:15.22 I I'm trying to remember but I think the point was

00:38:20.04 that like that that some that a hundred of the knobs would be

00:38:24.10 made with love from me right like kind of like

00:38:26.16 how we signed how I burned 50 bats but not the other 250 or whatever

00:38:30.11 so this would be that version of that and then if I remember correctly there

00:38:34.02 was the idea that we would metal tag the end of the knob that I cut with the

00:38:38.04 end of the bat so that they could be synced up again someday

00:38:41.18 am I remembering that correctly yeah well I remember that part but I don't

00:38:44.17 remember there being a bunch of other knobs I thought the

00:38:46.02 whole point of knobs was that they couldn't get made right and you were

00:38:49.14 gonna make them well then they found that they could

00:38:52.00 make the knobs they found a knob vendor but then they were like we already

00:38:53.22 ordered the bats and you can still do you can still do the thing where you cut

00:38:57.18 the bats in half and and that's fine okay so so you might get a Geoff cut knob

00:39:02.21 well you're gonna tell because the knobs are very [ __ ] different

00:39:06.18 first of all uh but secondly I thought the idea was that then I would take

00:39:09.23 these tags and I would put like tag number one on this knob

00:39:13.07 tag number one on this bad end and then you could put one and one together and

00:39:15.11 be like oh we found our match or whatever even though we don't necessarily know

00:39:19.14 what we're gonna do with the other half of the bats yet

00:39:22.14 but I got a thousand metal tags and I don't have number one through a

00:39:27.14 thousand so there's no way for me to sync up

00:39:30.23 I don't have two of the same tag and I certainly wasn't planning on just

00:39:37.03 putting a metal tag on every knob of the other 900 knobs

00:39:41.01 so I think what I need is one to a hundred

00:39:43.05 and then one to a hundred again in tags I don't think I need

00:39:46.04 two hundred to a thousand I think those are useless but

00:39:49.03 but they exist and I'm just [ __ ]

00:39:51.07 confused so I think I have some of what I need

00:39:53.04 and way too much of other stuff but none of it is getting this [ __ ] out of my

00:39:56.13 house so I I'm just I'm before I'm I'm awash in bats

00:40:00.02 and wood and I'm befuddled as to what to do about it why don't you just put the

00:40:05.20 metal tags on all the knobs one to a thousand and then well if I had made

00:40:10.22 if I had made the metal tags I would have made them to fit the knobs

00:40:16.02 do they not fail not not as such so you could always get the ones that

00:40:21.03 are from the bats that you cut and then just sharply number the bats

00:40:25.20 as you go so like metal tag match with sharpie

00:40:29.02 yeah or I could make them make another round of metal tags one to a hundred I

00:40:33.01 don't know I just all of this is to say that like I don't want it in my house

00:40:38.06 I my girlfriend's very kind so I kicked half my desk over

00:40:41.13 uh my girlfriend's very kind but I'm pretty sure she doesn't want it I mean

00:40:44.23 it's taking up half of my library and my entire kitchen table and

00:40:49.12 I don't even have the tools required to I just don't know what to do

00:40:55.03 I just I'm frozen I'm frozen with with bat indecision

00:40:58.06 I feel like much like my sauce they didn't even know what to do there's

00:41:03.06 like seven different bad ideas that we've suggested and they've all kind of

00:41:06.18 you've gotten all of them but like part of each one

00:41:09.11 like it's just a mix of things yeah I don't think I have a complete set of

00:41:12.17 anything yeah no all right well I'm just gonna

00:41:16.02 ignore it for a little bit longer then I guess do you have no plan

00:41:21.05 you're just gonna it's a future Geoff problem I mean

00:41:25.06 to today Geoff isn't gonna fix it today Geoff has to go do

00:41:28.19 that current Geoff has to do with rtx all week and all weekend so

00:41:33.11 I'm certainly not gonna touch it now so I can't think about it till

00:41:36.13 after rtx is over so uh then it's a problem for

00:41:40.10 10 days from now Geoff I guess do you have a garage no

00:41:44.12 I have a like a little uh like house in the back that's tiny where my I

00:41:48.23 put my bikes on my lawnmower but I it doesn't it's not suitable it's bad

00:41:53.00 storage no it's not good bad storage I wouldn't

00:41:55.09 want to put them there it's not climate controlled or anything I wouldn't want

00:41:59.01 the bats to swell with humidity or anything

00:42:02.15 what if we kept sending you bats what's up what if we just kept sending you bats

00:42:08.10 what if bats just kept appearing I hope they don't

00:42:11.17 I I'd like to I'd like to remove well I'll be honest with you I'd like to get

00:42:16.02 rid of all of the bats I have right now I'd like to remove all of the bats

00:42:22.00 you take the bats and you construct a game of thrones-esque

00:42:26.02 seat out of them with all the spare parts that you saw

00:42:30.02 off yeah I like that a lot the the bat throne here's what I'm gonna do

00:42:34.21 I'm gonna take all those parts and I'm gonna dump them off in your front yard

00:42:38.17 and I'm gonna let you make it your idea you can do it ah [ __ ] well how

00:42:42.04 do I even do that nails I don't know same way I would

00:42:45.01 probably do it you got a bunch of those already

00:42:47.10 that come with the set got all the nails you need apparently

00:42:51.16 no there's no nails it's that's the this thing too that

00:42:54.01 I thought I thought the tags were gonna be like

00:42:57.12 that I could like tack on with a little yeah with a little but they're not

00:43:00.15 they're like adhesive in some way and you they come

00:43:03.14 with a roller where you have to like roll like press roll it on which is fine

00:43:09.03 if it's a flat surface but these are all beveled I feel like

00:43:13.11 someone just listened to our conversations and then just started buying stuff

00:43:19.11 and listen to yeah and then listen I realize that

00:43:22.03 in most cases also I'll go so far as to say that in

00:43:25.12 every ins instance of my life I've been at fault

00:43:28.16 so it's probably my fault in some way but I I'll be damned if I know how to un

00:43:34.04 unfuck it right now so yeah we'll deal with that

00:43:37.04 future Geoff will deal with it I guess but if anybody has any ideas uh send

00:43:41.01 them my way don't send them to the face slack I'm no

00:43:44.21 longer able to receive messages on that but you

00:43:47.00 you both have my phone uh I believe still uh so uh it's not I don't know if you

00:43:52.10 can reach me on social media I'm not sure we're following each other anymore

00:43:56.12 but uh definitely you definitely have my phone number so you can text me

00:44:00.18 I don't I really like the tags not being

00:44:03.04 nail able I feel like that was such a key part of that conversation

00:44:07.05 I was really imagining like almost railroad spikes

00:44:11.07 as was like a marker that you would yeah yeah

00:44:13.21 or like uh if you've ever seen a like uh the well anyway uh a tiny little attack

00:44:19.07 but yeah it's uh it's frustrating uh that being said it I'm sure it'll

00:44:23.12 well when it's all said and done I'm sure it'll be a hilarious product

00:44:27.18 that the comment leavers will find hilarious they've been um

00:44:31.05 the comment leavers have been sending in their diagrams of the room they have

00:44:35.12 some of them have been shockingly good we've already dealt with that recording

00:44:38.17 wise but they're pretty accurate some of them I

00:44:41.23 saw one that was more accurate than mine it was like perfect in every way which

00:44:46.13 was phenomenal yeah I mean you you guys get extra

00:44:49.07 points like you were attempting to place things like the sushi container and all

00:44:52.12 that I think there's one I saw where it like nailed the rooms and everything but

00:44:55.16 they didn't really predict the sushi container seems to be

00:44:59.07 the thing that throws people they do not know where to place that

00:45:02.20 where was that uh that was in front of the fridge

00:45:05.22 that was next to the fridge and people are putting on the other side

00:45:08.16 oh I think that's where I put it isn't it I think you did I think you're in the

00:45:12.06 group that put it on the other side um I did trying to go to my bath nick

00:45:16.09 just said didn't you trip on one in the bathroom no it wasn't in the bathroom

00:45:19.18 was on the way I was going to the bathroom

00:45:23.05 I just got air pods I was very excited it was late at night

00:45:26.00 and uh I stepped on a plastic container took fall hard fall maybe the hardest

00:45:31.01 fall of my life I'm impressed though it was a great

00:45:33.22 landing it was like a stunt man landing square on the shoulders could not figure

00:45:38.17 out why my back was sore then the next day

00:45:41.07 but I had a point I don't know what my point was I've lost uh

00:45:45.01 we I was talking about sushi containers how close are we to marathon at this

00:45:48.00 point oh not not close not close we keep we keep re-aggravating keep getting

00:45:55.09 keep I will that's what I was gonna say people are commenting on like where's

00:46:00.19 the shimmy of the thing and I forgot about I had

00:46:03.22 the filing cabinet in front of the bed and I had a tv on the other side of it

00:46:08.06 so I had to I can't believe I did that for so long

00:46:11.14 you have the filing cabinet the one that's next to the dresser

00:46:14.08 I had that behind in front of the bed because that was one of the key

00:46:18.00 components of the fort I made the blanket for you

00:46:21.12 like so when you were in bed you looked at your feet and there was like the back

00:46:25.08 of a filing cabinet there yep exactly that's exactly what it was

00:46:29.11 because that was the the pillar that was a pillar for the

00:46:33.07 fort remember when we were first in the setup I had

00:46:35.17 like a blanket for it whenever where was the shimmy between the filing cabinet

00:46:39.12 and the desk no it was to the wall so I put the I have a 50 inch tv

00:46:44.11 I'm no longer using that's like an old and it's bulky

00:46:47.12 but I was playing ps2 and it was the only thing that it would work with so I

00:46:51.16 pulled it out and I just put it on the floor across from there's a little wall

00:46:56.05 between the closet and the bathroom and it was there but it was lined up

00:47:00.23 with the filing cabinet so I had to shimmy past that whatever I needed to go by

00:47:05.12 um it was annoying but I forgot all about it

00:47:08.20 well yeah it's just you know people like listening to previous episodes and

00:47:11.18 bringing up that I talked about [ __ ]

00:47:13.18 do you have anything else in your life right now that's like you know it's

00:47:15.11 really inconvenient you just need to deal with it and it will take like 10

00:47:19.12 seconds and save you hours and hours of annoyance I um oh that's a good I don't

00:47:25.18 not really but there those things for me typically I just don't deal with and it

00:47:30.15 just creates more anxiety even though I know it's not a problem

00:47:33.16 you know like it's like oh I could just quickly do this but then I don't

00:47:37.03 because it just seems like a minor thing and then it just builds

00:47:40.07 it takes me forever to resolve this I have something that would take

00:47:43.16 10 seconds to clean up but I've just been staring at it for about a year and I

00:47:47.13 refuse to deal with it at this point and it is it isn't inconvenient it's just

00:47:50.22 very annoying to look at I put up a shelf about a year ago and

00:47:54.11 I'd like drilled in the wall and it made some it made like wall dust

00:47:57.13 fall down and land on the skirting board I'm just still there and

00:48:01.18 I could easily just go and grab the vacuum right now and suck it up

00:48:04.19 why don't you do it right now while we're on in the podcast I'm encouraging

00:48:08.19 you to do it let's I want to hear it could this be the time we're going to

00:48:12.20 make your life better right now through the power of face the thing is I

00:48:16.17 just I feel like I only ever see it while I'm like walking from one thing to

00:48:19.20 another like I'm gonna go and get something or I'm going out and I'm just

00:48:22.21 like that thing again I keep walking by it yeah I

00:48:26.03 could just do it now couldn't I it's top of mind right now by the power of

00:48:30.12 face I compel you to clean this mess all right are we gonna be able to go

00:48:34.14 with him are we just here it's just us I think it's just you and I but let's

00:48:38.06 let's see if we can let's see if we can hear him uh in the

00:48:41.08 background while he's doing it uh what else is going on in your world

00:48:45.01 Andrew have you anything you need to clean right now

00:48:48.04 I have a thing I want to talk about but it is sort of extensive I don't know if

00:48:52.10 we have time within this episode so I still have a thing

00:49:05.01 that's a lot of sawdust that's taking a while

00:49:08.06 I don't he made it sound like it was just like you'd run your finger over it

00:49:12.06 it would be gone yeah it was a long long vacuum ah

00:49:16.11 all right we're good it's all right how does that feel

00:49:19.21 oh that feels good that feels does it I'm glad you compelled me to do that in

00:49:24.04 the middle of uh you're never you're gonna walk the next

00:49:27.02 time you're gonna forget about this very quickly and then the next time you walk

00:49:30.06 through you're gonna look over there and it's gonna be gone

00:49:32.23 and you're gonna you know your heart's gonna smile a tiny little bit

00:49:36.10 yeah I'll be taking the bins out I'll be walking by to be like

00:49:39.14 yeah your life just got better man do you have anything that you're putting

00:49:43.05 off like that something really easy to fix but it's

00:49:47.20 just so far down on priority you'll realistically never get to it I feel

00:49:51.08 like you have something for me are you aware of something that I have

00:49:54.17 that I'm not that I'm ignoring or no this is I don't think this is paranoia I

00:49:57.22 think Geoff I think he's just asking oh do you think I've laid some

00:50:01.11 inconvenience to your house I don't know yeah well I wouldn't put a

00:50:05.09 pass yet but uh oh come on well I don't I just

00:50:08.15 you know don't I don't trust any of you uh at all

00:50:12.17 anymore I had a great prank to do against you Geoff but I

00:50:16.17 I just don't I don't think I could put it together but I think you'd even like

00:50:20.13 it I almost texted Gavin it today yeah that's fine I'm doing my do

00:50:24.08 whatever I don't care just watch like well it's just I think

00:50:27.23 did you know that you could so we like don't spoil it don't spoil it

00:50:32.01 it's gonna be a hilarious prank no I don't think it'll ever actually

00:50:35.01 happen it's too elaborate but it's just it's

00:50:37.13 it's an amusing idea I didn't know this did you know that you could get games

00:50:41.03 graded like a card like there's a company that

00:50:43.13 you could send I didn't realize that so I was thinking about

00:50:46.14 like well what is the range in which you could get things graded I was wondering

00:50:51.03 could I get my bts sauces graded can I find a place that would like could I get

00:50:55.12 yeah they're sealed I want to try to get a 10 minute bts of each one

00:51:00.12 and then I thought well what if like Geoff went away and we just

00:51:03.10 [ __ ] we we graded every item in his house

00:51:06.00 like you come back in and everything's just surrounded in a hard plastic shell

00:51:10.00 with like different this is a 9.7 bridge is going to get an

00:51:14.08 f the fridge is definitely going to score lower that [ __ ] fridge dude my life

00:51:19.14 is still having french fries no well no no I mean it's the the same as always

00:51:26.15 it's it's it's just stock fridge dark fridge

00:51:30.17 it's expensive I don't have the money to fix it right now or

00:51:34.18 I don't it's not that I don't know I just don't want to spend the money to

00:51:38.12 replace it and it's it's so expensive and I just like and I'm so

00:51:42.08 mired in other [ __ ] it's just what's the point here's how it works right so

00:51:47.03 you know maybe we should just talk about my shitty story next episode

00:51:50.21 because we're supposed to wrap up right sure yeah I mean we're close to an hour

00:51:55.09 we can wrap up yep uh Eric says we should wrap are we doing two are we

00:51:58.15 doing two today we're doing joe I think we're doing two yeah oh my god

00:52:03.19 I got stuff.

00:52:05.22 I didn't get to any of my stuff for this episode so it was so weird

00:52:10.08 why my whole goal in this episode was to not talk about the condiment stuff and

00:52:15.22 to not let you guys get I was my I went in with the goal of not yelling once

00:52:20.20 and you guys and I and I failed uh yet again

00:52:24.17 as I fail at everything in my life I failed you know so

00:52:28.08 why should why should today have been any different

00:52:32.11 we had opposite listening face the uh the podcast where we highlight uh

00:52:37.12 the misery and failures of one Geoffrey Ramsey

00:52:41.09 while uh the much better uh and much more talented and much more likable

00:52:46.23 uh uh Gavin free and Andrew pen ton dance through

00:52:49.15 uh uh and on the misery that is me uh hope you liked it if you liked it

00:52:54.14 maybe read or write a review or star it up or whatever if you didn't
