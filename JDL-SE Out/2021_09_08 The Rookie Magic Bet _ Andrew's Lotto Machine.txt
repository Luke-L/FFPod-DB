00:00:37.16 Hello and welcome to another episode of the F**kFuckFacePodcast uh I'm Geoff Andrew

00:00:43.07 Gavin it has been too [ __ ] long since we recorded Andrew what's the rfa I

00:00:48.06 didn't well I didn't think this was going to be a show thing necessarily I

00:00:51.10 don't think it's that I guess if it's interesting enough to

00:00:55.16 talk so it's so important we're leading off no

00:00:59.11 just it was a funny I love how petty the nhl can be and how dumb it is

00:01:03.00 there is a rule so when you draft a player right they they immediately are

00:01:06.11 on a rookie contract you sign them to rookie deal there are limits to that the

00:01:10.17 first time a rookie finishes his rookie contract he becomes a restricted free

00:01:15.16 agent meaning that any team in the league can offer him a contract but if

00:01:19.12 he accepts it the team that drafted him has a week to match it if they don't

00:01:23.23 match it the team that sent the contract steals the player and compensates the

00:01:28.17 team with picks that's what a basic rfa is now that's a

00:01:32.12 completely legal rule but it's sort of an unwritten agreement between all of

00:01:36.17 the general managers that nobody ever takes advantage of it because it only

00:01:40.09 helps the players and it [ __ ] each other over it like increases their value

00:01:44.10 so from a cat perspective they're like we will not do this if you want to

00:01:48.06 negotiate long with your rookie coming off his deal nobody will try to poach

00:01:52.08 him it happens very rarely there's a time it happened where it almost caused

00:01:56.00 a fist fight between two general managers a few days ago maybe like a

00:02:01.01 week at this point the Carolina hurricanes sent an offer to a Montreal

00:02:05.13 canadiens player and he signed it so it was a whole thing of like this rarely

00:02:09.05 happens it was like a six million dollar contract with a 20 signing bonus

00:02:14.08 and the reason why they did the 20

00:02:17.11 signing bonus is because a few years ago the Canadians offer sheeted one of the

00:02:21.13 Carolina hurricanes players and his jersey number was 20. They did

00:02:25.17 not forget they held on to that for years and then at the first point in

00:02:30.05 which they could get revenge offer sheeted a guy with the same jersey

00:02:33.21 number and a 20 signing bonus there's no reason for it outside of just pure

00:02:37.09 penniness that's what in our face so it's like an

00:02:41.08 fu it was a total fu it's an rfa of you yes

00:02:45.16 it's the the very rare rarely used rfafu yeah yeah well I I think they view all

00:02:50.20 rfa's fuse as like that's always a nephew there's no I don't think there's

00:02:55.01 been one that isn't a nephew that's fair that was what I wanted to talk about I

00:02:58.12 don't know if that's I didn't listen was

00:03:00.05 that one of your five uh things you have written down why do you think I have

00:03:03.10 five things written then didn't you earlier say you had five bullet points

00:03:07.07 to talk about no I never said that do you have five uh I don't know I haven't

00:03:11.07 counted I could have sworn when I came in before we started the podcast I heard

00:03:14.21 you say I have five things on my list to talk about today no I never said that

00:03:19.12 where did I hear that then I have no idea Eric could Eric back me up Eric was

00:03:24.02 here I mean nick is backing up Geoff oh nick

00:03:27.18 is I don't remember Andrew saying that he had five things but for the sake of

00:03:31.13 content yeah Andrew you said that you had five things written down well nick

00:03:36.13 maybe he had five things like you went to Scotland recently thank

00:03:39.22 you I knew it nick nick recording nick says I have five bullet points ellipses

00:03:44.05 I knew it I knew it you definitely said that I never I never said I have five

00:03:48.16 bullet points that is maybe not that you

00:03:50.09 have five bullets feels unnatural to say

00:03:52.15 now you I don't think that's the thing I

00:03:54.19 would say I said I have five bullets you

00:03:57.03 said you have five bullets yeah that was

00:04:00.06 a reference to a bet that was my betting yeah that's that's not conversational I

00:04:03.18 have five bullets for betting with oh that's where the misunderstanding was

00:04:07.08 you know the common phrase I have five bullets I got five bullets I do that's

00:04:11.16 how I view it I'm gonna probably miss all five but it's fine it's a risky game

00:04:15.18 of Russian roulette is it yeah if you got five in the chamber well

00:04:19.09 it depends how many guns you're playing with.

00:04:22.15 I'm playing with 20 guns that's a pretty good chance good odds

00:04:28.02 wow that turned around on me yeah Gavin yeah welcome home buddy I missed

00:04:34.02 you so much don't ever leave me again I've I heard that you went jet skiing

00:04:39.19 without me I well I had to what am I gonna do you're not in town uh

00:04:44.06 I do have a funny little story about that and that is the thing we should

00:04:47.06 talk about is between the time how long has it been since we recorded by the way

00:04:50.22 three weeks three years it might as well be 15 years it feels like over a month

00:04:55.07 but it I guess yeah it's been the longest three weeks of my life and I

00:04:59.06 made a point of because I knew Gavin I knew you were

00:05:02.09 going home to visit your family and I wanted I don't know I don't want to like

00:05:06.07 I don't want to bug you with america so I haven't talked to you at all in three

00:05:09.18 weeks you wanted time I wanted you to have

00:05:12.18 like unfiltered time with your family and your friends from england and not be

00:05:16.07 reminded of all the dumb-ass well you did you did check in once and that was very

00:05:19.20 nice but just a long time so yeah I just said hey I hope you're doing well I

00:05:23.14 don't want to bother you yeah

00:05:26.23 how was your vacation man oh I'm so good

00:05:30.01 it was so nice to see the fam and I feel very refreshed I feel like being away

00:05:33.23 from content and being away from being able to make it like physically being

00:05:38.06 blocked for making content spurs a lot of uh

00:05:40.10 creative thoughts so I feel very nicely refreshed dude I'm glad to hear that I I

00:05:44.22 don't want to speak for Andrew but I feel like he and I have both been kind

00:05:49.00 of pulling our hair out because there's so much to talk about and we keep having

00:05:53.15 ideas and things we want to dive into and we just haven't been able to and

00:05:56.23 I've been like itching to get to this [ __ ] podcast I don't know about you

00:06:00.06 Andrew it's a really weird thing where I almost

00:06:03.07 have it's I don't know how to describe it really it's like there's so much to

00:06:06.11 talk about I'm scared we won't talk about any of it like there's so much I

00:06:10.00 don't know how to sort through what we should talk about and in my head there's

00:06:13.10 a fear of there's actually nothing to talk about because there's so much to

00:06:16.15 talk about you're paralyzed by options yeah you're wasting all of this time you

00:06:19.11 could be talking about it by worrying about whether or not you're going to

00:06:22.17 talk about it but yeah I mean we're we're starting now

00:06:25.15 but I'm saying leading into this podcast I had nerves going into this one I

00:06:29.06 haven't had like real anxiety about doing the show in quite a while and I

00:06:33.11 was just sitting constantly thinking do we have too much to talk about yeah in a

00:06:37.06 sense that we won't cover any of it I think there are two things there are two

00:06:41.01 things we could talk about two major things that Andrew and I have been

00:06:43.23 talking about that are in entire episodes by themselves okay uh and then

00:06:47.21 I have a bunch of stuff written down and I get Andrew you have your five bullets

00:06:52.02 and then I do Kevin I assume with all of the creative juices you've

00:06:56.10 got a ton you want to talk about so I actually have five I have five bullet

00:07:00.15 points you have five bullet points how many guns do you have let's hear number

00:07:04.15 one no I feel like I need to oh I have oh okay

00:07:11.01 I didn't mean to put you on the spot where responding to the thing you said I

00:07:16.21 got really annoyed when I found this out

00:07:20.02 okay okay how many episodes of the Jerry springer show did they make 700.

00:07:25.04 Oh no it's gonna be way more than 700

00:07:27.16 thing I feel like yeah I'm going to say I'm gonna say 5000 episodes

00:07:33.10 oh my god Andrew they made 4969 episodes pretty good but yeah why

00:07:39.05 didn't they just stop at 5000. It's insanity I read that and got really

00:07:44.01 annoyed at the Jerry springer show I mean it was a terrible shitty show for

00:07:49.03 like decades but why didn't they just finish out a

00:07:52.13 nice round 5000 shows and then stop they're going to stop like 30 episodes

00:07:58.08 short mental are there is there a uh 5

00:08:00.21 000 club that they could have joined originally I said

00:08:05.11 there's got to be a 5000 club I feel like he stopped because it just probably

00:08:09.17 was like all his soul that could take like all of his soul was gone at that

00:08:13.16 point like he's just morally beaten down

00:08:15.12 like people were probably saying like we

00:08:17.18 could get the 5000 we're so close that's

00:08:19.12 such a great number and he's just like I

00:08:21.12 can't do it anymore there's only so much I could handle he probably just felt

00:08:24.12 morally bankrupt about yeah profiting off the

00:08:27.11 people on the poverty line for 20 years or he woke up every morning and rolled

00:08:32.08 through his mansion of money to his car

00:08:34.10 and thought why the [ __ ] am I getting in

00:08:37.01 the car and going to work when I I don't have any room for all the money that I

00:08:40.21 have I do you think it was sort of like and I I

00:08:44.12 didn't watch the springer show regularly I feel like it's sort of the same

00:08:48.13 episode every single time is it like living in a groundhog day scenario do

00:08:53.03 you think making that yeah I bet you that's going to be in a loop he must

00:08:57.05 have said someone's name and then watched that person walk out and slap

00:09:00.15 the [ __ ] out of someone sat in a chair that a thousand times however yeah it

00:09:04.17 happened it seems like it was it feels like that's all that [ __ ] it would be

00:09:08.10 like if somebody just walked into this show and said what's the condiment left

00:09:11.20 and that was their job like it was just they're instigating for no reason

00:09:16.09 that's all they have to say it's that was what he did all he did was

00:09:20.05 instigate for 4962 episodes of chefs an impressive run

00:09:25.02 he also gave his like his final thoughts you know where he tied it all together

00:09:29.12 and caught up and taught a moral lesson at the end you know he just sits there

00:09:33.22 on his chair as like director's chair and addresses the audience I wonder if

00:09:39.07 with with 5000 episodes to look through almost could you base your life on only

00:09:45.03 Jerry springer's final thoughts can you just take all of his values

00:09:48.22 and base a living around it if Jerry springer didn't mention it you can't do

00:09:53.12 it I'm guessing that there's probably a book I bet there's a Jerry springer like

00:09:58.13 my thoughts book that you could use as a like a thought bible

00:10:02.13 for that I want like an episode breakdown book like it's just a fully

00:10:07.11 every episode written down and him giving little notes about each show just

00:10:10.23 a giant encyclopedia sized thing of trash hey man I don't know if you've I

00:10:14.21 don't know if you checked the trash lately but eric's got some conflicting

00:10:18.23 information he's posting interesting guiding light 15000 episodes Oprah

00:10:24.11 winfrey show 4500 Jerry springer show 5084. Interesting because on the Jerry

00:10:29.14 springer show Wikipedia page it's listed as 4969 I wonder if they roll in some

00:10:34.22 of the Steve show in that potentially what's the Steve show well you know that

00:10:39.08 cop that was like the security guy yeah he they spun him off into his own

00:10:44.03 show produced by the same company that was wait the security guy was a cop

00:10:48.10 he was a retired Chicago police officer yeah should he have just arrested

00:10:52.12 everyone that came out and well I think he was inspired

00:10:55.18 I think he was retired at that point but yeah he eventually I remember his last

00:10:59.07 name but he individually had his own show Steve

00:11:02.07 from Jerry springer interesting Dave what was like the most escalated thing

00:11:07.06 that happened on that show like remember how the host the cheaters got stabbed I

00:11:12.02 think that was fake but like what was that's did Jerry springer ever get

00:11:16.19 stabbed like what's the closest to an escalator I think uh was it Geraldo

00:11:23.11 got his nose caved in by a chair yeah what happened what like somebody threw a

00:11:28.05 chair at him or hit him with a chair it was just like a big brawl I think uh

00:11:32.12 there may have been some white supremacists involved and someone

00:11:36.15 chucked the chair oh or something interesting interesting times for television

00:11:42.23 dude and before that you don't like the that was that's that generation's

00:11:47.18 version of that show before that there was a guy named Morton downey jr who was

00:11:51.22 like the prototype for what Jerry springer became and I think the Morton

00:11:55.20 downey jr show was actually more hardcore

00:11:58.18 is there just like a large percentage of downey juniors Steve

00:12:02.21 you don't hear a lot of juniors but if your surname is downey it's likely that

00:12:07.01 they'll be a junior I think it's requirement yeah yeah you know I never

00:12:10.20 thought about that but you are right I don't know a lot of other multiple

00:12:14.08 juniors I don't either yeah I can't name any maybe the comment levers have some

00:12:19.20 yeah that come to mind all right well that was one bullet point

00:12:22.18 down Gavin what's next no I'm passing it over to you guys okay I got a bullet

00:12:26.20 point I got a Gavin bullet point that I feel like I feel like this is the thing

00:12:30.10 we talked about I learned about this last night this is very exciting I don't

00:12:34.07 know how many I have a feeling that a lot of people will know this I did not

00:12:38.12 realize this at one point Gavin I feel like you asked me

00:12:42.19 what is the most common thing I don't know or like what is the most yeah

00:12:46.19 yeah I learned last night I had no idea that this was a thing if you hold down

00:12:52.19 shift if you hold shift down it capitalizes your letters I had no idea

00:12:58.03 oh I thought you're going to go that right that one is meant to because

00:13:03.13 I had no idea I've been caps locking my whole life you pick caps locking a

00:13:07.17 single letter at a time and then every caps lock

00:13:11.07 every time yeah I would have issues sometimes one of my

00:13:13.18 biggest annoyances is when because I don't look when I I type is if I screw

00:13:17.20 up the caps lock combination where I make all the little letters big and the

00:13:21.01 big letter small because of caps locking yeah I had no idea I didn't know you

00:13:24.01 could do the shift but when you're typing on a phone and you put like a

00:13:28.06 full stop and then you start typing again it

00:13:31.04 automatically shifts to uppercase like what did you think that was doing the

00:13:36.00 shift like lights up I just assumed that like it knew

00:13:39.04 first letter of the sentence like once I put a period oh my god that it would

00:13:43.18 then just automatically capitalize for you I didn't real like I never paid

00:13:46.19 attention to the function on the keyboard I also don't know if that's

00:13:51.12 true so how did you get to the the the symbols you were shifting like

00:13:55.00 shifting numbers to get symbols right yeah I shift for symbols but that's all

00:14:00.02 I use the shift for I'm not a big shift user I don't use the

00:14:03.02 shift regulator but you shift for symbols and every time you hit the shift

00:14:06.15 key for symbols it changes everything to caps you never notice that I don't know

00:14:10.21 what that means I don't know what you're saying

00:14:14.10 I've never tried to type in a letter while holding shift never

00:14:18.15 if I'm if I'm putting a symbol in I'm holding the shift for the symbol then

00:14:21.22 releasing the shift the reason I had like kind of a flat reaction to that I

00:14:25.06 thought that it was going to continue like did you know that if you held shift

00:14:30.17 and pressed x or whatever yeah you just ended it if you held shift it

00:14:34.08 capitalized yeah I did you're basically you just ended it with did you guys know

00:14:38.04 shift yeah how I just didn't I didn't know like

00:14:43.01 well I think Eric even taught me that shift is how you drop down without

00:14:47.12 hitting submit like if you hold shift and enter it'll drop down on the thing I

00:14:51.14 didn't know that I never hit shift outside of making symbols

00:14:54.16 shift is the symbol key to me I felt I felt dumb the other day because my

00:14:58.23 girlfriend taught me that if you hold the space bar down on your iPhone when

00:15:02.12 you're typing you can then move your cursor to anywhere within the within the

00:15:06.14 text so you can edit much faster and I thought how if I've been doing this

00:15:10.15 wrong all these years how much of my life have I wasted on my iPhone uh

00:15:14.10 trying to like precisely get to where I needed to fix a letter and

00:15:18.14 you just made me feel like I felt so dumb you've made me feel so much smarter

00:15:22.16 I really I gotta thank you actually I just wasn't aware I don't know if it's a

00:15:27.11 dumb thing I just didn't know nobody told me I missed who taught you

00:15:32.19 a keyboard that was in school I was taught how to type in school I I would

00:15:36.13 love to see the first time you typed and I bet it was something as simple as I

00:15:41.03 bet it was a classic butterfly flapping its wings out a window and you just

00:15:45.04 zoned out for like six seconds looked at a butterfly and then didn't hear the

00:15:50.04 shift bit and then you lived the rest of

00:15:53.01 your life incredibly inefficiently I bet

00:15:55.12 this is exactly like how I switched math classes in the third grade for one week

00:15:59.07 and I missed roman numerals and now you know 46 years into my life I still don't

00:16:02.21 know roman numerals I bet you called in sick that day maybe you had a tummy ache

00:16:06.02 or whatever on shift day and you were just [ __ ] for the rest of your life

00:16:10.10 that's actually not your fault I feel bad I missed I missed the first two

00:16:14.11 lessons of french that I had so I missed numbers and letters absolutely screwed

00:16:20.06 me for the rest of the whole year I don't know anything

00:16:24.13 those are the two keys to french letters.

00:19:22.12 matter of fact I didn't used to sleep naked and now that I have a tushy I used

00:19:27.03 to sleep in underwear now that or like a jammy pants but now that I have a bidet

00:19:31.07 I uh I sleep in the nude I I sleep commando and I don't worry at all that

00:19:35.20 I'm gonna wake up uh covered in filth because I don't it doesn't happen

00:19:39.23 because I know that when I use my bidet and I put my little head on that pillow

00:20:58.21 you uh we're there for the last break [ __ ] we did Gavin I felt incredibly

00:21:03.22 stupid because we were opening football cards and uh

00:21:07.18 either Geoffer Eric I think Geoff said what's lvi and he meant roman numerals

00:21:13.12 in my head I was thinking like mvp like it stood for something says like least

00:21:19.01 valuable information or like I I replied it at a word said so they're like it's

00:21:25.01 roman it's roman numerals I felt what is l50

00:21:28.08 uh yes was that 56 lvi I don't know I have no idea I know it's

00:21:32.23 not least valuable information I know we covered it in the break show which by

00:21:37.16 the way we did a break show without you it wasn't the same without you we missed

00:21:41.08 you but it was still a fun time we did well I'll be there for the next one you

00:21:44.15 also could have waited two days and I would have been back but that's fine well

00:21:48.17 we couldn't uh which we should get to at some point

00:21:51.23 one of the things we need to talk about is from that break show and it includes

00:21:55.16 you whether you wanted to or not okay we picked for you I hate I hate his pick

00:22:00.22 and I hate what has transpired since his best he's gonna [ __ ] know about it

00:22:04.15 he's gonna win Gavin has no idea he's the most Gavin thing of all time yeah

00:22:08.12 everyone's been asking me about this jack's like oh what's this stuff about

00:22:11.23 this bet and Eric was asking me something about it yesterday I don't

00:22:15.00 know what anyone is talking about and it's weird that I'm involved so what's

00:22:18.08 happening here's what I'm gonna do for you I'm gonna go to Vegas in a couple

00:22:21.16 weeks uh and I'm gonna to place my bet and I'm

00:22:25.07 gonna place your bet for you as well just so that you get taken care of but

00:22:28.19 I'm not going to Vegas I mean you go to Vegas if you want to but I'm just saying

00:22:31.23 if you don't I'm going to already be there so I'm gonna I'll place your bet

00:22:35.09 for you if you need we should probably explain everything so he knows well find

00:22:40.19 something explain anything if we do this is the rest of the episode

00:22:45.16 you think so I don't know man maybe uh

00:22:48.19 yeah [ __ ] it let's do it let's go for it Andrew this is you okay so

00:22:53.12 Geoff and I talked about in the past before

00:22:57.01 even before face doing this idea where we were going to use spells on nba

00:23:01.06 players and then make bets based off of the spells that we sent towards the

00:23:05.03 players they're different versions of this idea we're at one point gonna have

00:23:08.05 like a sorcery battle between the the wizards and the magic which are two

00:23:11.14 different nba teams I have a battle of like magic between them uh this feels

00:23:15.19 like french again I feel like I've missed the letters and the numbers what

00:23:18.17 the hell are you talking about all right so there's an nba team called the

00:23:22.02 wizards there's an nba team called the Orlando magic we think it's funny that

00:23:26.19 they both had magic based names so we thought what if we hired uh like voodoo

00:23:33.05 practitioners and magicians and like this is like brew here people and we had

00:23:38.10 them place spells and curses on players and well at different times it

00:23:43.01 definitely leaned into the curse uh we've we've posited it up because we

00:23:47.16 don't want to get sued but uh we definitely had a had a period we were

00:23:52.12 going to like hex players and [ __ ] and see if we could affect the outcome of a

00:23:55.16 game Andrew would be one of the teams I'd be the other and we would duel with

00:23:59.07 magic so what the origin of this thought was I was thinking about how when

00:24:03.12 athletes are successful in things like whether it be you hear it a lot in

00:24:06.12 combat sports but you hear it in all sports they'll be like I just I want to

00:24:10.12 thank god or Jesus for that and then I thought I've never heard a player on the

00:24:14.18 losing side say like they had god on their side like Jesus blocked my

00:24:18.07 three-point attempt I don't know I made a great shot you're saying like

00:24:22.08 they only thanked god and Jesus they only nobody blames Jesus for their loss

00:24:26.10 only people like support and like I want

00:24:28.13 to thank god for this knockout it's like god's [ __ ] had a role in me getting

00:24:32.07 knocked out what am I supposed to do about that that's a good question like

00:24:37.01 Jesus back there god gets all of the credit and none of the blame and

00:24:40.03 apparently if everybody does it for god at least half of the people competing

00:24:44.05 god is betting against that's an excellent way to look at it yeah well

00:24:47.03 that's that was the starting point which then escalated to I've never heard a

00:24:50.08 player be like I want to thank all the spells I cast on myself this off season

00:24:54.01 like I didn't train I did very little working out I didn't practice I just

00:24:57.20 cast a bunch of magic on me it's working out great this is fantastic

00:25:02.06 it's like I want to thank the hoodoo practitioner who uh who placed the seven

00:25:08.12 spells that yeah that helped me win so we have escalated this to

00:25:12.08 the nfl season is about to start and we thought it would be great to pick

00:25:16.19 rookies for winning rookie of the year make

00:25:20.04 rookie of the year bets and then use magic on the people that we pick

00:25:23.21 Geoff was opening a box of college trading cards which I greatly

00:25:27.12 misunderstood what they were I thought they'd all be college players from the

00:25:31.01 previous season not just a bunch of players that played in college I thought

00:25:35.09 that was a weird box like the amount of players we got from the previous season

00:25:39.20 yeah that's how they all work the collegiate

00:25:41.20 packs yeah yeah it's just it's it's unfortunate but we got all these cards

00:25:45.07 and we had essentially everybody that we wanted on

00:25:48.22 this list and we drew a card for you Gavin so you have a horse in this race

00:25:53.13 you have a did I get a good one you well well that's let's well

00:25:57.00 let's talk about that so it had the the one stipulation is it had to be an

00:26:02.08 it had to be uh uh [Music]

00:26:04.19 uh what's the word an underdog right it had to be somebody who's not slated to

00:26:08.23 win rookie of the year that's definitely Trevor Lauren so I can't remember the

00:26:12.12 guy right behind him so I picked a guy named niji Harris who uh

00:26:16.13 played at the university of Alabama which is why I picked him Andrew who did

00:26:22.04 you pick I picked Justin fields he's a quarterback he's a quarterback yeah and

00:26:27.05 for you Gavin we picked another underdog we picked a guy named uh mac Jones who

00:26:32.17 is the he was drafted by the patriots to be their potentially their new future

00:26:37.11 quarterback however the patriots had uh a very high profile quarterback step in

00:26:42.21 after uh tom Brady left and uh so he was mac Jones it didn't

00:26:46.17 look like he was gonna start uh or get a lot of play time because this guy cam

00:26:53.00 cam uh newton is uh like a world class or at times has been a world class like

00:26:58.11 one of the best quarterbacks in the nfl very talented dude he's had some

00:27:03.05 troubles the last few years uh and then in a big big big surprise

00:27:07.17 on Monday or Tuesday they cut that dude and mac Jones is now the quarterback for

00:27:12.12 the patriots so your rookie is now running the show dude I'm in in the

00:27:17.01 weeks since we picked I think he was like the fifth most likely like he's a

00:27:21.03 pretty big underdog for winning rookie of the year

00:27:24.23 since that time he has now switched to be the favorite

00:27:27.14 since the declaration I don't know I don't know what to say about that

00:27:31.14 every time I read a story about a rookie like the jaguars had one of their

00:27:34.23 rookies get hurt and I was immediately suspicious that we have somehow caused

00:27:38.11 this that there's dark magic out there that people are using we're all like

00:27:42.04 using positive spells to you I know we are we're only endorsing positive magic

00:27:46.19 you don't know what's going on out there you have no control over that

00:27:51.22 just imagining that Quidditch scene in the first harry potter

00:27:55.10 so congratulations Gavin uh everything is coming up you right now that's

00:27:59.09 awesome I'm so excited I made a huge bet on Justin fields and then the next day

00:28:04.04 they're like mack Jones is starting for the patriots it's a good name too mac

00:28:08.00 Jones also an Alabama alum so you uh you're swimming we're swimming in the

00:28:11.19 same wake which is nice all right now you just have to figure out what

00:28:15.08 magic you're gonna do over the course of the next six months five months or

00:28:19.06 however long the nfl season is to secure your rookie of the year victory or you

00:28:23.14 know hire somebody yeah figure out someone

00:28:26.16 who knows what they're doing you live in Austin there's a lot of magic in Austin

00:28:30.08 dude I can take you to some places I feel like I need to buy crystals

00:28:34.13 that's the thing right that's like a good that's oh yeah that's a spell yeah

00:28:38.19 crystals there's a crystal store in Austin the one that says this place

00:28:42.23 rocks or something was it sound yeah nature's treasures that thing it's like

00:28:48.02 the crystal and rock stories that's huge huge and it's so many rocks

00:28:52.02 it is always packed can I so if I go to a fortune teller they can

00:28:56.12 only tell my fortune right that's the deal with those I think those are the

00:28:59.15 rules is that true though is that like a governing rule I think it might just

00:29:04.01 depend on their abilities well I think it has to be related to you somehow you

00:29:08.04 can't just ask about like well it's related it's fortune

00:29:11.19 it's related to him now I mean he is now he and Justin fields are are cosmically

00:29:16.23 tied for uh the next few months if I go to like six fortune tellers and ask who

00:29:21.17 the rookie of the year is gonna be for the upcoming nfl season I wonder what

00:29:25.19 will be said huh that should have been a factor I should have you could I should

00:29:29.12 have done more prep work I should have are you gonna give this person multiple

00:29:33.07 choice or they're gonna have to just pluck a name they're gonna have to tell

00:29:36.14 me who's gonna win I'm not gonna give them multiple choice I want to see

00:29:40.04 the universe has to say what the chance is that any one of them can give you a

00:29:44.04 name of someone who even has anything to do with that sport that's on them

00:29:49.02 you think do you think it's gonna be like an eight ball thing where it's like

00:29:52.19 my vision is blurry on this I see a jersey the name's kind of blurry I don't

00:29:58.10 know who it is I'm sorry I can't help it somebody's gonna wear a jersey.

00:30:03.18 [Laughter]

00:30:05.09 That's an interesting I should do that I just I wonder yeah pay some scammers do

00:30:08.16 it it's it it's it's within the spirit of the of the competition I think you

00:30:12.04 should I think you should explore we should all explore all available options

00:30:16.01 if we want to if we want to win this thing the problem is is actually I've

00:30:20.05 already made a pretty big bet on dresden

00:30:22.14 fields winning so I feel like if I spend money to learn that the opinion is not

00:30:27.04 Justin fields then I've just wasted more

00:30:29.08 money to confirm that yeah you've wasted

00:30:31.12 money knowing or finding out that you've wasted money basically hey gav

00:30:36.23 real quick can can you just say mac Jones mac Jones is that good Eric is

00:30:40.20 that good take need another take oh no yeah you can if you want to give me

00:30:43.18 another one that's good I that I mean that's the whole reason that I picked

00:30:47.12 them for you is I just thought like everyone has like these other ones and

00:30:51.07 it's just mac Jones feels like a very Gavin name for me wow that was that was

00:30:56.19 something you want to try that again mac Jones

00:31:01.00 that's pretty good I'm very impressed it's like wait who who said that Gavin

00:31:05.14 who said that governor Eric I'm excited about me and mac Jones I

00:31:10.02 think we'll be uh that will go far I hate it's just so you I like that when

00:31:15.01 it comes to gambling all you've ever done is [ __ ] me and then you get Matt

00:31:20.12 Jones and it's just he's the starter the next day

00:31:24.08 I I think the natural progression off of us breaking [ __ ] occasionally

00:31:29.01 is and I don't know the legality of this I want an Andrew gambling show I just

00:31:34.01 want to watch you lose money I think that's really good

00:31:37.22 speaking of Andrew gambling in an Andrew gambling show is an excellent point for

00:31:41.17 me to to mention that I have my foot I'm

00:31:43.20 using it as a foot rest right now is the mini roulette machine I bought for you

00:31:48.19 guys so that would be perfect for Andrew's gambling show Andrew was sending me

00:31:55.07 videos of people losing it was blackjack yeah it was blackjack yeah and uh

00:31:59.01 fascinating people just losing 10 grand in one go and their reactions to it oh I

00:32:03.11 think that'd be great for Andrew here I'll show you a thing I bought Geoff you

00:32:07.20 bought the roulette wheel for us yes I did I went through a bad run I've just

00:32:11.17 I've I no longer trust myself to make decisions I've lost that right I need to

00:32:17.14 regain that privilege again uh so I bought I bought this

00:32:21.05 I've just been using this whenever I'm like unsure on what I should do about

00:32:25.01 something a little bit good oh it's pretty big it's it's maybe

00:32:29.16 bigger than it looks it's uh yeah so I'll just be like

00:32:34.15 I'll be if I want to do something I just assign numbers to it and then draw

00:32:39.05 that's how I make the choices now because are you incapable are you ever

00:32:43.11 like how many chicken nuggets do I want today oh yeah 14. Okay

00:32:46.18 no no no I don't do it like that I'll be like I'll be I'll be like okay I'm not

00:32:50.12 sure do I want do I want a 10 piece do I want a 20 piece if it lands between 1

00:32:54.20 and 29 I'll get the 10. If it's above that I'll go with the 20. I just have

00:32:59.04 split everything I'm terrible at making choices I'll do the thing where I'll

00:33:02.12 like be on Netflix for hours just scrolling no more I'll have five movies

00:33:06.14 on a list I'll drop from the machine I've solved so many issues with my life

00:33:10.11 because of this machine but do you ever go against what the machine tells you

00:33:14.03 like you never you cannot go against the machine it has one rule that you must

00:33:19.02 obey the machine at the point I disobey the machine what am I even doing there's

00:33:22.21 no what what decisions are you putting into

00:33:25.19 this because surely not every decision some decisions no you have to make

00:33:29.15 yourself no if they're if it's like if I'm on the fence about something or

00:33:34.09 if I want to do something but deep down I think actually that's a bad idea then

00:33:37.23 I go to the machine to see if it will validate my bad choice so what was the

00:33:41.14 most recent one yeah there you go uh the most recent one was uh deciding where I

00:33:46.14 was gonna order dinner from last night was the last time I used the machine

00:33:50.19 what were the I got Chinese okay uh Chinese pizza

00:33:53.17 I could have got sushi I had a whole thing I didn't know what I wanted so

00:33:56.21 what numbers in the machine what number did you draw they gave you 17. Was it

00:34:02.06 17. It was delicious I got the fried rice it was wonderful great time

00:34:06.15 you wanna hey you wanna let's see Gavin think of a number think of a number

00:34:10.17 right now one and sixty one and sixty there's sixty balls in this machine got

00:34:14.17 it I got it here's the thing I think there are sixty when I moved it over

00:34:18.18 there I made a mistake and all the balls fell onto the floor and shot everywhere

00:34:24.04 and it's possible there are some behind my fridge I do not know

00:34:27.19 I do not know if all 60 are in there at this point well you've you've

00:34:31.14 misbalanced the decisions in your life because some balls fell under the fridge

00:34:36.05 it was like a mistake where there were two balls in the chamber and I thought I

00:34:40.06 can't get those out I'll just lift the lid and put my hand in and it was tired

00:34:43.15 I wasn't thinking I just lifted it and they all fell on the floor

00:34:47.03 how do you get them out through the top no okay so do you see the chamber on the

00:34:50.23 right they bounce into there and then the sensor above detects oh there's the

00:34:56.02 ball and it stops spinning oh if I hold it it goes into the sensor

00:34:59.09 yes so then I push the green button and a little panel moves and the ball drops

00:35:03.21 down the chute and into the hole and then that's how that works do you

00:35:06.21 want okay so you think of a number let's see let's see how lucky this is well do

00:35:11.05 I tell you the number or what uh I'm not sure no you think you know what

00:35:15.12 you think you keep it in your head we'll try right now it's also very loud I'm

00:35:19.16 gonna warn you why don't I type it into discord once you've pulled the number

00:35:23.13 okay I'm pulling it right now I'm not gonna be able to see my screen so I

00:35:26.12 won't see your discord post are you ready I'm gonna warn people this

00:35:30.21 is very loud yep also the machine is broken okay

00:35:36.10 oh my god sounds like a wall falling down okay

00:35:42.21 we got a number 434343 that was close what was it what was your number 54.

00:35:51.07 That was actually pretty close that was like my springer fake number class we

00:35:56.04 should uh you know how there was that idea that we never followed through with

00:35:59.13 where Andrew you could only grocery shop on end caps at the grocery store yes

00:36:06.00 no well that sounds great too I think there's a lot we can do with this

00:36:10.08 machine I'm very excited about the possibilities but in the short term

00:36:14.04 it might be funny for you just to take a week or a couple days where you every

00:36:17.22 decision in your life has to be made with that machine like what shirt do I

00:36:21.17 put on today I love the idea of gamifying am I gonna leave the house

00:36:24.23 gamifying your whole life is so funny yeah that is so before I bought the

00:36:29.13 machine Gavin and I had a conversation about like making all your choices just

00:36:33.19 be random not up to you you have to draw a line on questions

00:36:38.00 because like technically everything becomes a you have to make a choice

00:36:41.02 you're making your choice in ways you don't necessarily yeah that's how we we

00:36:45.00 clarify that you're gonna have to make some yourself because otherwise you

00:36:48.19 could just say like oh should I record face today and then suddenly you don't

00:36:52.00 show up because the balls told you not to yeah or it could be you know an issue

00:36:56.12 of do I I need the [ __ ] do I use a toilet like

00:36:59.09 everything if you make everything a choice

00:37:01.23 I think I used the example should I wipe my ass and you were just like that's

00:37:04.22 ridiculous of course I'm wiping my ass yeah

00:37:07.14 so I think it has to be that's the kind of code I'm living by it's things that

00:37:11.21 I either want to do but also part of me saying you don't don't do that yeah I

00:37:15.14 think you could be more like I think I

00:37:17.19 have to [ __ ] do I do I [ __ ] now or wait

00:37:21.01 15 minutes do I [ __ ] an hour later not like yeah it's like

00:37:25.11 to fix it's more to fix indecision than yeah that's a great way to phrase it

00:37:29.12 I don't feel like once again the 15

00:37:31.05 minute thing are you asking me to [ __ ]

00:37:33.02 myself like it depends on the situation do I have 15 minutes when I'm making

00:37:36.12 that question or is that a question I'm asking when I have more than 15 minutes

00:37:40.01 I don't know I mean I'm just thinking about my life very often I'll think like

00:37:43.12 do I have time to take a [ __ ] right now

00:37:44.04 or do I feel like taking a [ __ ] because I can hold it a couple yeah it'd be

00:37:48.01 easier just to hold it and do it later like I don't know I feel like if I need

00:37:51.16 a [ __ ] I just go and have one it depends on for me I can I I can

00:37:55.10 chamber my shit's pretty long I can't do that with p uh but definitely with poop.

00:38:00.21 [Laughter]

00:38:01.22 A [ __ ] in the chamber is such a great combination of words

00:38:05.15 do you find do you feel like you have two chambers

00:38:09.05 how do you I've got two [ __ ]

00:38:12.04 like somehow cars have a reserve gas tank yeah I got two okay like I can sit

00:38:17.14 down and do a poo and it's done I could wipe and get up or I could do that and

00:38:22.15 then wait about five minutes and then round two comes oh yeah yeah

00:38:27.14 and it it just buys me more time between now and the next poo if I get both

00:38:33.10 chambers empty I feel like that second if I

00:38:37.10 let's say I do that right I take a [ __ ]

00:38:39.12 and then I eat something like a mcdonald's burger the cavalry is coming

00:38:44.15 within 15 minutes it's quick like that it's gonna it's

00:38:47.16 gonna push down the next the next yeah I don't it's truly like a magic trick

00:38:51.11 within itself I don't know how to explain it but they're like when I eat

00:38:55.07 fast food certain fast food the cavalry will come I didn't know that anyone sent

00:38:59.02 the memo out but we're going back it's a round two we're immediately headed back

00:39:02.16 to that I have a I have a similar thing where I drink iced coffee or cold brew

00:39:08.00 pretty constantly like you know like water

00:39:11.07 and uh that's at least there's you get

00:39:11.07 at least one [ __ ] per cup of iced coffee

00:39:14.16 so it's like there's some days where you take like it's just like you're just

00:39:18.00 taking you're just going back and forth from the fridge to get more iced coffee

00:39:21.05 to the toilet it's a pretty constant stream I forgot about uh

00:39:24.23 dumping in england because it's different like different food different diet

00:39:29.02 it really it dwindles down to I think I could I was going like once every couple

00:39:34.08 of days whereas here it's like probably twice a day

00:39:36.20 and and I I love it I love having an anus that hasn't been used in a day

00:39:44.02 why don't you just try to adopt your British bland no taste food diet.

00:39:50.00 [Laughter]

00:39:52.00 like the only reason you [ __ ] more in america is because you have better

00:39:56.12 options I don't I don't know if that's true you

00:39:59.12 don't you should test this you think if there was a Franklin barbecue in in next

00:40:03.22 to your house you wouldn't eat there constantly

00:40:07.20 how am I going to test this Andrew what do you mean I've got to test this well

00:40:12.00 you just you get the same you make the same foods you eat the same food you eat

00:40:15.15 the diet you had when you were in england for like a week I would import

00:40:19.12 all my meals from england it's just different [ __ ] it's different

00:40:23.05 ingredients different sources it's not it's not like sugar in the

00:40:26.14 bread and stuff I got you you're being ridiculous yeah but that's what expats

00:40:31.03 do you manage to get the hands on branston pickle that wasn't so hard yeah

00:40:36.09 I got [ __ ] multiple cans of salad cream

00:40:39.09 I like that gavin's like I have to eat wonder bread when I'm here I have no

00:40:44.00 choice it's a lie I can only have this one type of sugary bread the stuff on

00:40:48.04 the British isle is the stuff that keeps like the stuff in a jar like pickled

00:40:51.23 crap and baked beans they're not like shipping salad and milk and bread

00:40:56.01 and stuff over what the [ __ ] do you mean

00:40:59.07 you can't let you make this salad like what you're saying you're saying British

00:41:03.12 cows make milk that makes you [ __ I less maybe than American cows that's what

00:41:08.13 no I'm not saying it's specific to milk but I mean they certainly eat different

00:41:13.16 grass and it's different tasting I don't know

00:41:17.12 I feel like salad was a really weird choice by you and I'm just picking

00:41:22.06 something that's not gonna American salad be making me [ __ ] like crazy.

00:41:27.01 [Laughter]

00:41:28.21 No one has ever said that ever until this moment well I can't I truly I

00:41:34.23 don't I can't identify the individual different things that make me poop twice

00:41:40.10 a day here and poop once every four days in england for them

00:41:45.12 we have had this conversation 20 times over the course of our friendship and it

00:41:49.16 always boils down to the you like the food in america you have more options

00:41:53.12 that are more exciting to you that are worse for you and you can't control

00:41:57.08 yourself in america and in england you there's less to eat so you just eat

00:42:01.03 you make your own pasta all day all night long and that's what you eat and

00:42:04.13 then you never [ __ ] I don't think okay I'm gonna try this the next week

00:42:09.02 starting next week I'm gonna try and eat

00:42:11.05 stuff that causes me to [ __ ] once every

00:42:13.06 two days but I don't think I could do it with the whole of heb I don't think I

00:42:18.10 could do it you're acting like shepherd's pie is the most exotic dish

00:42:24.00 that is you cannot access they don't have the technology to make

00:42:28.10 shepherd's pie in anywhere else these are the yeah I just I need my

00:42:31.13 non-shitting British crisps the American crips are they're ripping my [ __ ]

00:42:35.09 apart I'd love to hear from comment leavers

00:42:37.21 who have spent significant time between these two countries because I'm not

00:42:42.19 making it up it's nobody thinks you're making it up what are you

00:42:47.18 we don't think we just don't think it's the quality of the food we think you eat

00:42:51.18 shitty food in america because there's a

00:42:53.12 lot of [ __ ] because Austin is a shitty food town it is a foodie town do you

00:42:57.14 think you could do it do you think you could eat eat next week and [ __ ] once

00:43:01.18 every two days I don't know I've never had that experience I'm not

00:43:06.02 it's like a weird thing to say what do you mean do you think I can do it

00:43:10.19 can I only [ __ ] once every two days is that what you're asking

00:43:14.10 is that the question yeah if you could if you could change your diet to achieve

00:43:18.01 that well hold on Andrew how often do what do you how often do you [ __ ] every

00:43:22.01 day I fee y'all definitely every day how many times how many poops a day do you

00:43:25.17 have I probably once I'd say okay you average once a day Gavin you currently

00:43:29.18 American Gavin you average what twice a day you said between one and two

00:43:35.07 but definitely one I would say I'm between two and four a day probably oh Jesus

00:43:40.18 I'm exceptionally healthy it's the more you [ __ ] the better off you are it's

00:43:44.12 good for you is that true wait oh yeah big time I think that just means you

00:43:47.21 have you're having as much uh coffee as I should be having water it's like it's

00:43:51.00 like you're I'm running it's like you're running [ __ ] drills I'm just getting

00:43:53.03 better it's better and better like [ __ ]

00:43:55.22 girls because you always got a cat of course yeah yeah it's true too

00:43:59.18 I feel like you just made a 15-minute argument that the reason why Gavin shits

00:44:03.23 more is because he eats shittier food and then you're like I have four shits

00:44:08.10 because I'm so healthy what are you talking about

00:44:12.04 I gotta defend myself here and also I am also full of [ __ ]

00:44:15.02 dude I've also got I also I also I'm an anomaly I'm different because I have to

00:44:18.22 take medicine to make me [ __ ] or I'll die because I have that disease so I

00:44:23.11 have to every night of my life I have to

00:44:26.21 drink miralax which then makes me [ __ ]

00:44:30.02 my brains out gently I I might add uh so I you know it's like I

00:44:34.20 I had the amount of miralax I go through is

00:44:36.23 unbelievable yeah well that explains the four a day sometimes it's like you turn

00:44:41.03 it into a full ship podcast like we've had before but what's uh nick and eric's

00:44:45.11 averages while we've got them here oh that's a great question once every other

00:44:50.02 day every other day whoa you're on the English way how'd you do it I

00:44:55.05 I don't I mean I don't think I eat too too much so that's probably it.

00:44:59.22 [Laughter]

00:45:01.09 I think it's just probably less consistent it's just a quantity thing no

00:45:05.08 not you [ __ ] man once a day yeah like so wait yeah but I just have like

00:45:10.00 lunch and dinner are you just having lunch uh I mean it's like it kind of like

00:45:15.08 eating like grazing kind of like throughout the

00:45:18.19 day but nothing's like a huge meal typically how about this

00:45:22.05 Eric what is your what's on the menu for today what is your like what will you

00:45:27.01 eat from start to finish today uh I had a banana I had broccoli

00:45:31.09 brown rice and chicken I'll probably have like steak and maybe a quesadilla

00:45:37.20 something to like for dinner but like all of these are smaller so throughout

00:45:43.05 the day I'll have some pineapple or watermelon or

00:45:46.08 something like that that's probably what I'll have typically damn how about you

00:45:51.11 guys moderately healthy what is your average day uh

00:45:54.13 like you said you only eat lunch and dinner so what'd you have for lunch

00:45:57.11 today and what are you gonna have for dinner tonight

00:46:00.21 I I didn't mean to stump you I'm sorry if that was too hard

00:46:05.03 I don't want to grind the podcast to a halt or anything we can move on I was

00:46:07.03 thinking about what I had today I'd add a smoothie I had a smoothie for lunch

00:46:10.19 okay at a Nana uh about 11. Don't know what

00:46:14.09 I'm gonna have tonight I don't wanna like as you haven't said I don't wanna

00:46:18.02 make this too gross but I have a question of

00:46:22.06 are all shits equal no is there like the equival how do you measure

00:46:25.11 are we doing like is there a bunt of the [ __ ] world like what is the half

00:46:30.03 is that why you hold out a baseball bat

00:46:31.20 to [ __ ] yeah yeah we're like it bounces yeah when you're in your I still

00:46:34.22 honestly don't know how the bat knobs work we haven't even touched on those

00:46:38.23 but I'm still confused about that I got another one we gotta have the bat knob

00:46:44.16 I just mean like as every time you sit

00:46:46.17 on a toilet and [ __ I comes out is that a [ __ ]

00:46:50.08 Because there's a gift if you need to wipe you've taken a [ __ ]

00:46:53.22 I just okay but I just feel like that scale isn't fair because there's a

00:46:58.19 massive cause I feel like that well you're just gonna

00:47:01.10 sit down and [ __ ] like one more teaser and then you're done well I'm saying

00:47:05.14 that can happen think about the fishing world okay if I

00:47:10.10 [ __ ] full if I pull out a 20-foot salmon the biggest goddamn salmon

00:47:14.20 anyone's ever seen and somebody fishes a goldfish those shouldn't count as the

00:47:19.08 same thing you both were fishing and you both caught fish yeah and and nick has

00:47:23.18 brought up an interesting point he said what about the rare wipe free shits you

00:47:27.10 still have to wipe you still have to wipe so it counts you still had to see

00:47:32.04 what was on the uh yeah it does count why why is everything

00:47:35.07 all right why is everything on this podcast we need to find the regulation

00:47:39.18 version of it what is this well it's just like

00:47:42.14 no if Geoff is saying I'm [ __ ] four times a day which is two to four really

00:47:46.04 high two to four two to four I've [ __ ]

00:47:48.13 twice today already and I don't think I'm done see that's a lot to me in my

00:47:52.11 head it can't be what I would consider the average [ __ ]

00:47:56.01 I can't in my I can't wrap my head around you're taking four average shits

00:47:59.18 a day oh yeah I mean not all shits are created equal but they're all [ __ ]

00:48:02.16 that's what I'm saying so I'm just making sure I wanted more of a

00:48:05.12 clarification than an argument not ev not every [ __ ] is a grand slam

00:48:09.19 not every [ __ ] is a home run a lot of shits are doubles and singles I have a

00:48:13.12 lot of doubles I have a lot of doubles in my life I have a lot of like I'm in

00:48:17.16 scoring position I got an extra bass uh it's good for the team I haven't

00:48:22.12 scored but it's way better than a bunt or a single you know maybe I advanced

00:48:26.05 the runner if there was somebody on maybe I maybe I scored a run I don't

00:48:30.00 know but what would that what would the grand slam be

00:48:32.23 no I don't want to know I think it's probably whatever happened to Andrew

00:48:36.13 that day when he almost [ __ ] on a tree or at the mall or whatever no you know

00:48:39.18 what I think I honestly I think the grand slam is because you feel good

00:48:43.05 about yourself when it's a grand slam it

00:48:46.04 is a giant [ __ ] that requires no wipe at

00:48:48.06 all that's the grand slam I haven't just get up and go very long time

00:48:51.22 love a good grand slam miralax does not allow for grand slams yeah it's rare I I

00:48:56.07 don't get a lot of grand slams in Austin I'll be honest

00:49:02.00 the chat is going very gross right now what what's the uh the knob

00:49:06.21 update uh yeah well I have a knob 8

00:49:09.16 update.

00:49:12.17 I'm going to tell you right now the I'd like to preface this by the way with I'm

00:49:17.18 going to annoy you uh in this conversation that we're about to have

00:49:22.02 what does that mean you're going to get annoyed I okay uh so here's the knob

00:49:26.23 update I had the hundred baseball bats full full-size baseball bats right

00:49:33.01 uh and I had 900 uh pre-made knobs and then I uh

00:49:36.15 eventually I got a thousand and 100

00:49:39.07 metal tags numbers one through 100 twice everything I needed I began last

00:49:45.09 Thursday or Friday uh I got the old I got my chop saw that I bought I set it

00:49:50.19 all up in my backyard and uh Saturday and Sunday I want to say I

00:49:56.00 spent about seven hours each day I'm very tan now

00:49:59.12 uh spent seven hours on Saturday and probably seven hours on Sunday cutting

00:50:04.21 cutting knobs I did 102 bats all 102

00:50:07.20 bats are knobless I then had to take the cut knobs which were imperfect uh and

00:50:12.17 sand them down with like a little uh like a little black and Decker mouse

00:50:15.16 sander and then I sanded the knob the bat end because that was [ __ ] up as

00:50:20.12 well and I just wanted to be nice and symmetrical so I cut 102 knobs I sanded

00:50:26.17 102 knobs and then I sanded a hundred and two uh bat ins

00:50:30.15 that was my entire weekend that was probably 25 hours of work or something

00:50:34.11 over the course of the weekend although I gotta say

00:50:38.04 way [ __ ] better and way more enjoyable and way more fun to do than

00:50:42.14 burning those [ __ ] uh numbers into those tiny bats that was way less work

00:50:47.04 but way shittier work I enjoyed every second of playing with the power tools

00:50:50.19 this weekend when I finished that I then affixed the little metal

00:50:56.07 uh serial numbers to the knobs that I created and then

00:51:01.09 affixed the other ones to the uh noblesse bats so they had matches I have since

00:51:07.09 given those two to rouge teeth they have them they're in rusty's possession so I

00:51:12.22 no longer have 102 bats in my house what I do still have is 900 bat knobs which

00:51:18.08 holy [ __ ]

00:51:20.01 900 is such a bigger number than 100. It is going to take me the rest of my

00:51:25.07 [ __ ] life to do to to put these tags on these on these

00:51:29.01 pre-made bat knobs I think I've done about since Monday I think I've done

00:51:34.03 about 450. It's on behalf I've seen the I've seen some of the pictures I've seen

00:51:38.05 I will say the quality of work excellent they look professionally done

00:51:42.13 I think that they I think I think the audience the comment leavers or the

00:51:46.06 purchasers will be very surprised and pleased with the level of quality I do I

00:51:50.15 put a lot of love and effort into it but here's the problem yeah they're they're

00:51:55.09 all the wrong size every single one of them they're they're all wrong

00:52:00.07 you you we had this conversation there was size one there was size two and

00:52:06.02 there was size three we agreed that size one was like a button

00:52:09.19 and size three was ridiculous it's like half the handle size two the perfect

00:52:14.12 knob you've made every single one in size three okay

00:52:18.12 here's my rebuttal to that okay first off one [ __ ] you two [Laughter]

00:52:24.00 I I measured and made them the same size

00:52:27.05 as all of the pre-made bat knobs so they

00:52:30.02 would be uniform so don't blame me blame the 900 bat knobs that I had to match I

00:52:36.04 mean it would have been obviously all 900 are the wrong size it would have

00:52:40.03 been a good opportunity to make a hundred of the correct size that could

00:52:44.20 have been like you know the special ones because natural can

00:52:49.04 suck the poop out of my butthole that's what you can do the third one of

00:52:54.14 the day the fourth one which one I just any any of my four any of the four poos

00:53:00.02 I don't care uh I'm pooping pretty regularly throughout the day so anytime

00:53:04.08 you want to come over I'm probably within an hour of a poop you little

00:53:09.11 [ __ ] did you not think when you saw all

00:53:12.12 of the uh I just said handle this is the size it is I'm not gonna go and I'm not

00:53:16.02 gonna go and cut down the 900 I'm just gonna make the hundred the same size and

00:53:20.17 by the way [ __ ] uh you know where I live this shit's been in my house

00:53:26.02 feel free to come over and help out at any point whenever you [ __ ] want to

00:53:31.09 I'm I'm happy to help I'm just saying we gotta sand down no

00:53:35.12 not to the right size no we don't we're fine they're fine and they're too long

00:53:41.07 they're how long are they how long are they the knob should be I don't know

00:53:46.04 hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on and I'll find out because I just

00:53:51.08 gotta go find a [ __ I knob and then I'll measure it continue

00:53:54.14 continue to converse and oh by the way however long whatever number I come back

00:53:58.20 with right if it's three inches or seven inches or whatever just so you know

00:54:02.22 whatever that number is is the correct [ __ ] number for how big a bat knob

00:54:08.00 should be as of this moment it is now the regulation batten off science

00:54:12.19 no matter what that number is it is the regulation bat knob size that governs

00:54:17.16 all bat knobs across the galaxy in perpetuity I'll be right back Andrew you

00:54:22.12 do remember the conversation we had right where we had the three different

00:54:25.14 sides you know what I honestly don't but I'm glad you do because this has been a

00:54:29.04 lot of fun yeah you do Eric you do right oh no I I I I remember I appreciate it

00:54:34.12 this is why him because I remember it happened I

00:54:37.12 don't remember this no I I remember I just don't remember what length I know

00:54:40.22 it was like the middle where it wasn't the button and it wasn't like half the

00:54:44.17 bat but like just before Geoff gets back what number are you happy with

00:54:49.04 do you think I would I would want like between one and one and a half okay the

00:54:53.18 absolute knobs anything anything that's that makes it longer than that

00:54:58.12 to the point where it is long and not like a like a cube right I will say

00:55:03.10 I will say you saying one to one and a half it it makes me so thrilled for

00:55:07.22 whatever Geoff is going to come back with because I mean you can see there's no

00:55:11.20 way pictures they're going to be about three inches at least also

00:55:17.22 are you saying that we're selling handles and not we're not selling knobs

00:55:23.01 we had the whole conversation we ended up deciding between a button a knob and

00:55:28.15 a handle he's made a thousand handles okay I'm back I'm back okay we put this

00:55:32.12 to a public vote didn't we I measured do you want just the hand the knob like

00:55:37.06 the part that comes off the knob is what I measured not the knob itself right

00:55:41.07 like the part I like it in dinklages as well very specifically

00:55:44.18 someone find first someone find the the public poll we did wait what are you

00:55:48.23 measuring it's about an inch and a half oh but oh but what that is without

00:55:54.08 kidding I I've been listening to this whole thing it's threes son of a [ __ ]

00:56:00.12 that's how [ __ ] big that's how big tony and the merch department made it so

00:56:06.12 that's how big it is besides we did it how about this [ __ ] show up at any

00:56:11.18 of the face merch meetings and make your opinion heard we have them

00:56:16.04 every two weeks you're always invited you've showed up to zero merch meetings

00:56:21.11 we didn't need to merge me the comment leave us voted you did it on

00:56:26.03 Instagram comment leavers don't make the

00:56:29.00 bat knobs the merch department does they buy them

00:56:33.05 oh man I had a completely different issue that I thought it was unrelated

00:56:38.09 I'm so happy that versus this issue oh I can't wait for you to go for an

00:56:44.12 issue well so we're only selling the knobs right like we're selling knobs I

00:56:49.01 don't I don't know what we're selling to this point okay because I don't know I

00:56:53.14 was thinking I was talking about Emily tonight I was thinking we should sell

00:56:58.12 the the so the the 900 knobs will sell as knobs right but the other the 102

00:57:03.00 uh I think those should be a blind item you're buying one or the other and you

00:57:06.18 don't know it's a 5050 chance do I get the knob or do I get the knob end or the

00:57:11.16 the bat end oh like a bit of a knob like a blind box

00:57:15.00 like a blind that was that was my issue I'm gonna put this is a terrible it's

00:57:18.02 the only one that I could find and it's it's largely obstructed it's from our

00:57:22.00 most recent break [ __ ] stream you're holding the bat up our logo is on

00:57:26.16 the end of the bat and then you cut off the bottom part so I was curious what

00:57:30.14 why did we put a logo on the end of the bat if we weren't going to sell it

00:57:34.22 I feel like we've had that discussion multiple times there's nothing we can do

00:57:38.01 I just have no idea what's going on also the serial I will say this because you

00:57:43.11 know we all shared and agreed that that was ludicrous but the uh I will say that

00:57:47.20 in my mind that was solved because when I started putting the serial numbers on

00:57:51.14 I realized that the serial number is safe face on them so it is technically

00:57:55.11 labeled on the other end sure good to know that was just that was mine

00:57:59.05 I wasn't sure if we were gonna sell like what we're doing with the other half I

00:58:02.19 thought we were selling full bats and knobs

00:58:05.07 not that we were just doing knobs and then how are we still having this

00:58:09.20 particular conversation I don't know what are we selling this is

00:58:14.02 incredible hey Geoff do you like producing are you having a

00:58:18.13 good time because this is what it is all the time for every show

00:58:22.06 it's the best I feel like I do feel very uh because obviously I wasn't in the

00:58:26.14 meetings I haven't helped in any way and I'm still annoyed by it so I feel like

00:58:31.18 you know maybe I'm the [ __ ] in this situation but I'm pretty sure

00:58:36.15 they should all have been size number two

00:58:40.01 pretty sure about uh well you know for the record I wanted size number one and

00:58:44.00 I acquiesced to two and if they ended up

00:58:46.07 as three I don't give a [ __ ] dude I oh I

00:58:48.15 won I voted for one I don't want that I just wanted it to be a [ __ ] I just

00:58:52.01 wanted to be a knob I didn't want any end on it y'all are the ones that fought

00:58:55.07 for the ends no I like the knob I'm a fan of the knob

00:58:58.16 the reason this is perfect though is that it's been completely faced again

00:59:04.06 and this is the perfect product here's what I'm looking forward to we're

00:59:07.06 selling handles we sell so we sell these [ __ ] we sell these items right we

00:59:11.23 started with the 50 bats mini bats then we've gotten to the knobs now we've got

00:59:16.10 the 100 uh self cut and then the 900 so the next order is going to be I think

00:59:20.22 probably at least 10000 knobs and I'm gonna

00:59:24.08 you know what I'm gonna take a back seat I'm gonna let you do those gav you have

00:59:28.14 you're very opinionated on knob size on shaft length and instead of instead of

00:59:34.01 fighting against the tide and getting it wrong every time and then being a huge

00:59:38.05 embarrassment to the company in the podcast I'm gonna take a step back and

00:59:42.02 when we do the run of ten thousand I'm gonna let you cut them all and then

00:59:45.22 we'll know they're going to be done to gavin's exacting standards which I think

00:59:51.09 uh makes sense to me can I borrow your tools absolutely okay I

00:59:56.13 I feel like Gavin you said that you feel like you're the [ __ ] in this process

01:00:01.20 I think that's been the constant throughout this all you've

01:00:06.15 done is caused chaos I remember like three months ago it feels like

01:00:10.22 Eric Geoff and I were in a merch meeting we settled all of this it all made sense

01:00:15.14 for the first time it clicked then we recorded like 30 minutes later and you

01:00:20.05 asked three questions and make arguments that we couldn't counter you just like

01:00:23.23 you threw a [ __ ] wrench into everything you weren't there you just

01:00:27.02 all you've done is caused chaos in this process I feel like I was asking good

01:00:31.07 questions maybe you should ask them at the meetings

01:00:34.09 I don't think anybody's saying your questions are bad I think that maybe

01:00:37.20 they were just asked at the wrong place at the wrong time

01:00:41.03 well just have the meetings on slack and I can read them and reply to her a

01:00:45.22 meeting is that's extreme a meeting about a bat knob

01:00:48.08 mentor there's so much there's so much that is not that there's so much

01:00:52.05 discussed in those meetings that we go oh and this oh and this yeah it is no

01:00:56.04 joke dude there's a lot of ground that gets covered in those meetings for sure

01:00:59.09 like the new jet ski merchandise that we should talk about at some point we

01:01:02.19 didn't even talk about our jet ski adventure we'll have to talk about it

01:01:05.20 next episode all right I can't I'm really excited to get a

01:01:08.07 better handle I'm really excited yeah I hope you I I feel like you're

01:01:12.03 over selling the handle now I feel like you feel bad I hope you quick quickly on

01:01:15.11 the quickly on the store when they go for sale because they're going to go

01:01:19.03 fast and I don't have any extras to give you so you can buy one like the rest of

01:01:22.21 them ah I didn't get a special one that's

01:01:25.09 I did I made I made two special ones but they're not for y'all I made because we

01:01:30.19 had a hundred and then there were more bats

01:01:32.22 and I thought just in case I miscounted uh because I was numbering them as I

01:01:36.06 went I was like just in just in case I miscounted uh let me do two extra ones

01:01:40.05 and then and then I'll just a fixed numbers but then I realized

01:01:44.06 there was only there's only one 101 and one 102 so I hand wrote those uh so

01:01:49.07 those are the two special ones and I signed them is there such thing

01:01:54.06 as a saw that has sandpaper on the circular bit

01:01:57.09 it's like sores and sand saws and sands that is a great invention if it doesn't

01:02:02.21 exist and you should patent it okay we could sell it and then I'll complain

01:02:07.03 it's the wrong size should we should we stop talking so that we can

01:02:11.00 start talking again very quickly yeah all right well thanks for listening to
