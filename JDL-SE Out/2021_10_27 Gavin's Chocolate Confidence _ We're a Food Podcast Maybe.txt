00:00:25.11 [Music]

00:00:32.17 Did you stop uh uh I sort of I don't know why'd you stop well

00:00:37.18 he threw Craig in there I asked Gavin we always kind of start early who knows

00:00:43.07 what Andrew what Andrew and I were talking about definitely before we

00:00:47.09 started Gavin is uh that he asked if I had uh if I went through Florida in a

00:00:52.12 wheelchair and I was explaining that I didn't but that we very

00:00:57.20 uh carefully planned the week's events from light to heavy so

00:01:01.15 we did the the [ __ ] that could hurt me on the last day so that jack could be

00:01:05.05 sure to get as much of his content filmed as necessary so all the backs

00:01:09.06 shake edge was at the end yeah max shake it at the end it it

00:01:13.03 culminated with me almost throwing up on the incredible hulk ride [Laughter]

00:01:17.15 that was pretty much it are there like theme parks knobs you know like in the

00:01:22.00 same way that there's a wine snob of sort like is there is the equivalent of

00:01:26.10 that for theme parks there's all kinds of snobs you know who

00:01:30.15 I bet they are you know how about the worst are apple snobs

00:01:34.12 apples get oh [ __ I you apple snobs oh wait what do you mean

00:01:38.20 I was very aggressive that I realized that could go separate ways that is the

00:01:43.18 statement I might actually agree with someone's at apples

00:01:47.02 no no no no no the context I thought you were leading into something very

00:01:51.00 specific a conversation we had that was a real moment on the podcast right there

00:01:55.12 audience well I I was processing that could mean two things and one of those I

00:02:00.13 agree with you just jumped in front of tim cook but no one fired a bullet

00:02:04.20 no I'm I would no I would not jump in front of tip [ __ ] I'm letting that

00:02:08.06 bullet fly in that scenario Jesus terrible well I don't want

00:02:12.00 anything back listen you're the one who fired the shot I'm just saying I'm not a

00:02:17.09 big apple guy in that way I'm a huge fruit apple guy not a big apple computer

00:02:22.06 person right although I use one but I just there's a snobbery in the apple

00:02:27.18 products it's it's a disaster can I say I was referring

00:02:31.14 it was a fruit apple comment right it was a fruit apple comment I forgot that

00:02:37.04 apple computers existed I was not expecting that response I'll be honest I

00:02:41.10 forgot we uh I forgot we have an apple thing I immediately went to the iPhone

00:02:45.04 really see I thought because we had a whole conversation about this on text

00:02:49.09 I'd love to hear eric's opinion on a specific issue we were talking about

00:02:53.14 because I think it's insane that that you don't don't think about that but the

00:02:57.03 whole thing because then I have I'm sitting I'm looking at an apple computer

00:03:00.04 right now so it clicked in I didn't know what you meant I agree apple snobbery

00:03:04.10 can be terrible apple snobs for the fruit completely justified it's a top fruit

00:03:09.04 love an apple it is an elite fruit and the the comment I'd like to to argue

00:03:14.11 not argue but bring up the Eric Geoff said that apples don't have a range of

00:03:19.23 textures he questioned this oh that's crazy that's absolutely have a range of

00:03:25.09 textures yeah there's like that's why there the word mealy exists to me

00:03:29.09 because when you eat an apple oh that just means bad apple if it's mealy I

00:03:32.23 just feel like it's that no that's a texture types but that's different

00:03:37.05 texture like that look there's apples that are more mealy than other apples

00:03:40.23 there's apples that are firmer some that are softer there's different apple

00:03:44.14 textures for sure listen when we go to firm or soft I'm assuming it's it's how

00:03:48.20 ripe it is no it's like a pizza it is specific different types yeah I would

00:03:52.21 say like like a granny smith is a a hard crispy apple but like a bray burn or

00:03:57.03 something it's got it's a little bit softer there's not as much resistance

00:04:00.12 when you're going into it absolutely I'll be honest I don't pay attention to

00:04:04.05 texture on apples they all feel the same to me I pay attention to flavor I will

00:04:08.05 say this that makes sense to me because you're the biggest banana guy I know and

00:04:12.15 I think bananas have dog [ __ ] texture and it's my main issue with the banana I

00:04:17.20 think their texture [ __ ] stinks I hate it can I tell you

00:04:20.21 can I tell you something [ __ ] crazy happened to me I didn't even think this

00:04:24.07 was content but you just reminded me something crazy happened to me in

00:04:27.15 Orlando in Orlando last week I was out there for the other podcast and uh we

00:04:32.02 were you know we're doing the universal stuff and the hotel we had we stayed in

00:04:36.13 uh doesn't have room service and my whole plan was not to leave the hotel

00:04:41.07 room so that I could rest my back you know just lay down the entire time only

00:04:45.01 get up to go to the to do my job and then immediately come back ignore jack

00:04:49.09 and and producer ben uh don't want anything to do with them and just lay

00:04:52.22 down and rest uh so that I could be a hundred percent for face right and uh so

00:04:57.11 we stopped the first night at a little convenience store and bought a bunch of

00:05:01.14 groceries so that we could eat in the room and I bought a bunch of bananas

00:05:07.11 and I opened one up and I had a banana the next day

00:05:11.05 and I almost threw up I thought I had covered for a second

00:05:14.14 because I have never had and please you're gonna think this is a weird thing

00:05:19.16 to say I've never had a banana taste bad before I've had bananas go bad I've had

00:05:23.14 bananas like turn mushy on the backside and be black or whatever and that's not

00:05:27.16 good you take a bite of that you don't realize you're like cause the banana's

00:05:32.17 turned right but I've never had a fresh ripe banana taste like [ __ ]

00:05:37.07 it was the craziest thing it tasted like it had like a sweet taste to it I I

00:05:41.20 almost vomited it was it was the grossest thing and then because I could

00:05:45.22 smell it I smelled it in my hotel room the entire time I was there I was uneasy

00:05:49.20 the entire week I was in Florida because I had to take the banana downstairs and

00:05:54.12 throw it in like the little trash can next to the dumpster to get it or next

00:05:58.11 to the uh elevator to get it further away from me did you buy a plantain by

00:06:02.08 accident no no I've had plantains before dude

00:06:05.04 this was a banana it's like a water I was gonna say chiquita I don't know what

00:06:08.17 the brand was but it was definitely it might have been dole or del monte see I

00:06:12.01 feel like bananas have the most you get good mileage from a banana like a banana

00:06:16.16 can physically turn pretty far and like go almost all black but it's still an

00:06:20.15 edible banana inside that's the nice thing about a banana right there's not a

00:06:24.13 range of flavor like an apple a banana is a banana it's always gonna taste like

00:06:28.18 a banana which is why at 46 years old when I put a banana in my mouth that did

00:06:33.08 not taste like a banana it freaked me the [ __ ] out you know those like small

00:06:38.02 marshmallow banana candy type things I'd like to think that they just made

00:06:42.08 full-sized versions of those and that's what you made

00:06:45.15 isn't that what old bananas were they were the flavor of like artificial

00:06:49.13 banana now or something yes the original banana flavor is is gone now I think

00:06:54.09 right or it tastes like it tastes like banana candy and then real bananas no

00:06:58.04 longer tastes like old bananas used to I

00:07:00.08 wish I could weigh in and be like yeah I

00:07:02.06 kind of agree with these banana opinions they're like yeah that's never happened

00:07:06.06 to me I [ __ ] hate bananas I never eat banana like I can't there's no point

00:07:09.04 what don't you what do you not like about that just the texture I think the

00:07:13.09 text like the taste is like a I don't know maybe a 5 out of 10 like the taste

00:07:17.19 is very average to me and the texture is terrible it's an awful texture

00:07:22.04 don't enjoy it at all I would I that we should start ranking fruit because I

00:07:26.03 would say a banana is a is an eight to me like and it's never a seven never a

00:07:31.03 nine it's only ever an eight because it always tastes the same but I would give

00:07:34.08 the texture of a banana like a nine and a half I like seriously I like I like a

00:07:38.19 banana I like chewing on a banana yeah bananas are top tier fruit and as we

00:07:42.12 were discussing recently Andrew also good because you can drop it and keep

00:07:45.17 eating it no there's like there are definite perks to the banana you can eat

00:07:49.11 it without actually touching the fruit that's great I'm not even gonna argue

00:07:53.09 that it's not a good fruit like people love the banana it's a very popular

00:07:58.19 fruit but I think texture-wise it's a [ __ I disaster and it goes lower because

00:08:03.08 but you like a brownie you like a cupcake

00:08:06.15 what the [ __ ] does that mean they're completely different things if I if

00:08:10.23 nobody bites into a brownie and it's like ah this is the same as the banana

00:08:14.12 it's squishy it's squishy there's like a little bit of resistance more bit more

00:08:18.04 density there's a [ __ ] chalkiness to bananas and like it just gets all over

00:08:23.20 the like there's nothing the per bite of a banana does not

00:08:27.10 compare to the per bite taste of a brownie or any of the other things you

00:08:30.17 listed I feel like you've had a banana once and it was Geoff's one yeah it was

00:08:35.11 just like a one-off yeah or you're going off a 14-year-old memory

00:08:39.05 of a banana dude if you put a banana in a smoothie I'm fine with that taste I

00:08:43.15 think it's a staple of a smoothie like that if we're going to evaluate food as

00:08:47.00 a whole you need to factor in other ways to use it in a smoothie you need it but

00:08:51.12 just if I'm eating it out of a grocery store grabbing it from the shelf

00:08:55.08 eating a banana the texture sucks it's a terrible texture if you want to factor

00:08:59.20 in other uses the banana may be the most

00:09:02.19 useful fruit of all time because anytime you're in a chase and you're trying to

00:09:06.17 run away from a cop or a villain or a mountain lion you can [ __ ] throw it

00:09:10.08 behind you and you're guaranteed to you're guaranteed freedom that's the

00:09:13.18 best thing an apple can do is keep the doctor away for one more day also they

00:09:18.13 stop you up if you got the squits what if you got the runs what do you mean

00:09:24.00 what are you are you saying what I think you're saying yeah what else

00:09:28.21 what go ahead no explain further well you know what I'm talking about

00:09:33.12 well no I I I kind of do but I just am stunned that you immediately that's

00:09:37.12 where your brain went as he said absolute go-to if you're [ __ ] liquid

00:09:40.18 if you've been shear liquid for a couple of days get a couple of bananas down

00:09:45.05 I've always been sorted out but okay you were not no

00:09:47.23 this was a miscommunication I greatly misinterpreted what you were guys what

00:09:52.09 did you think I thought you were going to shove it up your ass this was another

00:09:57.07 apple conversation and it was awesome to watch

00:10:00.12 I thought that you were talking about corkscrewing your [ __ ] with the bananas.

00:10:05.13 [Music]

00:10:07.03 I thought you were joking not that you were saying like if you eat it it helps

00:10:11.03 with the sore stomach I thought you're making a joke that was like really you

00:10:14.16 went there immediately we clearly have recorded in a while we're all up we're

00:10:18.15 like yeah I'm talking about iPhones you're talking about eating fruit I'm

00:10:21.16 talking about eating bananas you're talking about shoving them up my ass we

00:10:23.14 need to get on the same page how do we how do we get in sync we are out of

00:10:27.22 sight we're faced out of sink stop riding

00:10:31.10 roller coasters I was thinking about was

00:10:33.18 it Beverly hills cop where he like takes the banana and shoves it in the car and

00:10:37.11 it [ __ ] the car up so that's where I was thinking of banana insertion and

00:10:41.12 then you said that so that's where my brain went and I was baffled I did use

00:10:45.13 the phrase stops you up I guess but yeah from like a solidifying fecal matter

00:10:50.12 point of view also bananas are high in potassium and that's good if you like

00:10:54.08 you should just eat a banana before you

00:10:56.19 oh [ __ ] you're gonna do your marathon at some point right Andrew yeah

00:10:58.15 you should eat some bananas before it it'll help you with the with your what

00:11:02.19 do you think we're further from the marathon or Geoff throwing a ball oh dude

00:11:08.00 throwing a ball I'm not I'm going to throw that ball pretty soon I'm almost 100

00:11:12.17 I'm close how about this gav are you around this weekend yeah well

00:11:17.01 let's throw the ball yeah okay on Saturday it's sure if you want to if

00:11:21.03 you're free yeah all right we'll throw the ball

00:11:23.10 Saturday that was quick I thought we were months out yeah it seemed months

00:11:28.17 out you said like December was sort of well I I I wanted I wanted some time to

00:11:33.12 stretch and and get my body ready but uh I can't I can't take too long because I

00:11:38.10 have to allow for the idea that I might have another catastrophic and pointless

00:11:42.03 injury in between and I don't want to keep kicking this down the road forever

00:11:45.14 so I'd rather set a shitty baseline and then just have greater improvement than

00:11:50.12 do it properly Andrew do you want to run a marathon on Saturday uh

00:11:56.04 no no I don't oh feel like you've lost your confidence

00:11:59.01 yeah well no I just I don't listen I don't buy that just throwing the

00:12:02.06 baseball on Saturday if he throws it on Saturday will you run the marathon on

00:12:06.03 the next Saturday sure I'll start on the phone well no

00:12:10.00 wait wait a sec because we're gonna talk

00:12:12.13 about another thing that might lead into another thing that you don't know about

00:12:15.20 I'll do it I'll do it after the Saturday at law yeah Saturday after the thing

00:12:20.15 we'll talk about later but what about your shoulder then you have to check

00:12:24.04 your shoulder did you already go to the doctor are you all clear are you

00:12:28.12 medically clear oh because of the hernia yeah I'm on the I'm on the fence about

00:12:31.12 whether I'm going to follow up on that or not

00:12:33.23 it was such an impact I don't know I know hadn't it been affecting you like

00:12:38.05 your entire life yeah you're like for a couple years

00:12:41.20 no that's a hernia that my shoulder has been [ __ ] for a while that's different

00:12:45.11 I can't do anything about my shoulder it's arthritis I could get a cortisone

00:12:48.18 shot if I need to which will probably happen after I throw the ball probably

00:12:52.23 have to get a big shot of cortisone in my shoulder that'll be fun

00:12:57.05 uh but yeah I'm prepared to do it because I care about this podcast so on

00:13:01.07 Saturday I can mark on my calendar that you will

00:13:04.13 throw this ball on Saturday we will get a number for it the only thing that

00:13:08.21 could get in the way of me oh f1 this weekend never never mind I gotta

00:13:13.11 go to f1 this weekend f1 is okay no it's not every weekend it's like

00:13:16.16 every few weekends what do you mean you're going no it's in Austin dude it's

00:13:20.03 in Austin oh it's not f1 Austin yeah yeah I have weekend tickets

00:13:23.22 uh so if I can throw it like I don't know what the schedule is but if we can

00:13:25.18 throw it before or after f1 we'll do it otherwise I'm gonna have to wait for one

00:13:29.11 see Kevin you're giving me [ __ ] about not committing to Saturday two minutes

00:13:33.10 later just bumping it we've already I just forgot about f1 but I still want to

00:13:36.22 fit it in I still want to fit it in this way do it at the f1 track

00:13:41.11 do you have tickets no well it's gonna be hard for you to

00:13:45.16 [ __ ] be there then isn't it all right but now that we're 16 minutes

00:13:49.14 into this podcast uh-huh uh well with the part we didn't that wasn't a part of

00:13:53.16 the problem maybe we're like 14 minutes in anyway we should probably Andrew I

00:13:57.02 have notes of what you wanted to talk about today and what I want to talk

00:14:00.06 about Gavin I don't know if you had anything but I only had one thing

00:14:03.23 why don't you hit us with it uh well it's kind of similar to all the flavors

00:14:07.00 we've been talking about and um the fact that I hadn't I hadn't had any

00:14:11.12 confidence yet on Facebook I found my confidence

00:14:15.02 what is your confidence I felt like I was chocolate confident like you know

00:14:20.06 how you get you know how you get those like lint

00:14:23.09 excellence things where it's like 70

00:14:26.01 percent cocoa and I was like I'm pretty I like these pretty extreme percentages

00:14:31.01 on chocolate it's like really dark a little bit bitter and I was looking

00:14:34.14 through all the chocolates in the store it's like seventy percent oh bloody yeah

00:14:39.20 eighty eighty five and then I saw one that was a hundred and I thought I'm

00:14:44.19 bloody I'm really gonna like that one so I bought

00:14:48.15 lint excellence uh a hundred percent coco let me um chuck this in the old

00:14:53.12 discord so we know what we're talking about

00:14:56.18 oh an update discord update what's up what's new

00:15:00.12 all right hold on here here we go we're so bad at posting things we're talking

00:15:05.01 about them like does it work 74 weeks in or whatever we still suck at that bam

00:15:10.09 all right that's in there there's nothing there we go okay so we're

00:15:15.01 getting chocolate bars specifically I wasn't sure if you meant like a hot

00:15:19.05 chocolate powder no I was like the clarification you break it off you eat it

00:15:23.05 I was like oh this is gonna I'm bloody gonna love this but then there's a

00:15:27.12 disclaimer on it it said excellence 100

00:15:30.03 reveals the strength and richness of cocoa beans flavor profile delivers a

00:15:35.20 strong blah blah blah to fully appreciate the intense cocoa experience

00:15:40.12 we recommend that you progressively develop your palette

00:15:43.14 through our range of high cocoa content but content chocolate bars starting with

00:15:48.23 excellent seventy percent then eighty-five percent then ninety percent

00:15:53.23 I thought well I've not done any of that I'm going in there

00:15:58.06 I was like I've pretty I'm pretty sure I've trained my palette already

00:16:02.17 throughout life yeah I I snapped off a bit of this chocolate shoved it in

00:16:07.14 by far the most disgusting thing I've ever

00:16:11.09 eaten in my entire life it immediately it immediately turned to mud and like

00:16:17.06 Russian it was the bitterest I've never experienced

00:16:21.06 they were not kidding my palette I was immediately just like.

00:16:26.06 I was like dry heaving I couldn't get it

00:16:29.01 out because it just turned to pace I was like

00:16:33.12 um so it was overconfidence uh massive misjudgment there on the old

00:16:39.22 tongue so I I think I do have to slowly work up to uh

00:16:44.10 I would I would love you both to try I'm not sure if you're a big chocolate guys

00:16:49.22 it was utterly foul I don't know how it's even food

00:16:53.16 how quickly do you think you could eat the entire chocolate bar Gavin

00:16:58.04 oh I couldn't I couldn't eat I couldn't I don't think I could eat zero zero

00:17:03.09 three months let me show you how much I uh

00:17:08.06 I'll show you how much I ate so when you

00:17:11.00 were when you're reading the bottom part

00:17:13.06 of it with the like start 7580 what was your thought process were you like this

00:17:17.08 is like I was laughing [ __ ] like what I

00:17:19.11 was saying yeah what dumb thing to write on your chocolate I don't eat this

00:17:23.20 chocolate so you still had 100 confidence until

00:17:27.08 you put it in your mouth I had 100 until I ate 100

00:17:30.18 and I would oh my god I I literally don't think I could eat the

00:17:35.17 rest of that in if I if you gave me 24

00:17:39.01 hours I wouldn't all go in so in 24

00:17:39.01 hours that's 20 that's 21 bars or 21

00:17:42.08 little squares so you don't think you could eat one an hour with three hours

00:17:46.11 to breathe no I think I would throw up after the first

00:17:49.20 one and I would just be looking at the rest for the rest of the day and it

00:17:52.21 wouldn't happen next time we record not next episode

00:17:55.20 because we're doing two today I will eat that whole [ __ ] thing in like four

00:18:00.21 minutes are you shaking I've never had it but yeah it's just chocolate

00:18:04.10 can you do something else for me too it's not chocolate it's not chocolate I

00:18:08.00 don't know what it is it's not chocolate it looks like chocolate yes Geoff Andrew

00:18:13.09 I love this idea I think this is a great

00:18:16.04 idea and I support it however I think it would be even better

00:18:20.12 it would be even better if you washed it down with a banana

00:18:24.10 why I want to hear you eat a good banana on on podcast okay I think Gavin and I

00:18:30.10 are on to something we both think you haven't eaten one in a long time and I'd

00:18:35.13 like to get your up to the date like two day Andrew panton

00:18:40.14 uh 2021 opinion on bananas I don't think

00:18:43.03 I want to combine the two though but I I

00:18:45.02 will do both I'm open to both absolutely

00:18:47.05 I just don't have a banana first I don't see I feel like dip your hair I hate

00:18:50.16 this anna's so much in my head I feel like it will throw me off my chocolate

00:18:54.11 eating game for later we'll do this do this uh you do the chocolate then rub

00:18:59.20 your foot in ginger and then eat the banana

00:19:02.08 I'll tell you after one bite of this chocolate you would eat a whole bunch of

00:19:05.10 bananas just to get the taste out of your mouth

00:19:09.01 it's like four hours of just being like every every so often the flavor would

00:19:12.17 re-hit my tongue and I'd be like

00:19:14.21 you know what I like that idea I'll go chocolate first

00:19:18.14 palate cleanse with the banana give it a try what is interesting though is that

00:19:23.01 um the entire bar is one serving are you sure when you have yeah when you have

00:19:28.02 like a like a bag or something or like something that needs to be it's like oh

00:19:32.00 this bag contains 18 servings of this or whatever but it's the whole thing is

00:19:35.12 just one so I think eating the whole thing in one go won't be too bad for you

00:19:41.07 so now that you've eaten the 100

00:19:43.12 do you think you need to start at 75 do you feel like you're at 85 if you could

00:19:46.15 go to 50 would you go to 50 like where do you think

00:19:49.17 your taste range is at this point well like because it set me back yeah well

00:19:53.12 I'm just curious like what do you think your actual ideal number is now that you

00:19:57.13 know it's not 100. Well I I do like 70

00:20:00.02 so I just love that there's an 85 and a 90.

00:20:03.18 Yeah like that's it's significant enough between five percent to warrant a

00:20:07.06 completely different chocolate bar I think I could I think I'd do 85. Okay do

00:20:12.00 you think you could get to 100 if you trained in the lint way like that

00:20:16.21 according to the disclaimer on the packet I could I I would say if I ate

00:20:22.19 71 months 85 the next month 90 the next month yeah I think give me three months

00:20:28.08 I could try 100 again I think I think I like the long play on

00:20:31.22 this I think we should do that in tandem with the other Andrew thing I'd like to

00:20:36.03 see I'd like to see if I'd like to see the experiment I'd like to see

00:20:40.12 this in action I'd like to see if it's possible I want to know if you want to

00:20:44.12 achieve it or do you think you would feel like a monster by the end of it if

00:20:48.12 you hit a hundred and it was just like no no way I'd be so proud of it it'd be

00:20:52.12 something to brag okay yeah I would say I would uh I'd break I'd break off a

00:20:56.05 little square for everyone around me I'd be like all right

00:20:59.11 I'd be the only one that wasn't rolling on the ground yeah all right I like it I

00:21:04.21 really don't what like four min is four minutes weird

00:21:09.03 should it be like five just so it's an easier number yeah let's do five

00:21:15.07 they have a 99 coco do they I'm no no I'm looking at it right now

00:21:19.14 blowing up I'm trying to look I didn't you're like 8590 they have a [ __ ]

00:21:24.10 what is the difference between a 99

00:21:26.21 and a 100 I don't know it doesn't even mention the 99

00:21:30.16 on the there's a nine five nine they're just like that's the the end

00:21:35.07 zone 99 to 100 same thing I assume I don't think you could do that in five

00:21:39.18 minutes I really don't have you had extremely high cocoa content chocolate

00:21:44.13 no I don't even like dark chocolate not a fan

00:21:47.15 I really don't if we're placing bets on it I don't think you can do it

00:21:50.23 physically I don't think you'll get it down oh I will add oh if we're getting

00:21:54.22 bets involved this is I'm now I'm excited about this I think you found

00:21:59.05 your confidence too oh I'm absolutely chocolate confident

00:22:03.18 I'm not even all that into chocolate as we said last episode not a big sweets

00:22:07.18 guy they're okay well it's not I don't think it's sweet at all well

00:22:11.21 it's chocolates it's in the candy category I know it's not sweet total sugar's

00:22:17.05 zero grams but you would put if somebody

00:22:20.06 if somebody has a candy bar you'd put it in the candy section it's a chocolate

00:22:24.15 bar it's in the candy aisle it's in this no but it's it's like all bitter it's

00:22:29.14 not I mean we'll find out when you eat it but wait

00:22:32.05 a second yeah Eric just said is it's in the baking section is it in the basement

00:22:36.23 this section no this is in the chocolate section there we go.

00:22:41.11 I'm so excited for this I wish we could get some delivered to you today I

00:22:45.11 genuinely if you would have just if you would have texted about it I would have

00:22:49.22 it ready to go I have there's zero hesitation in my mind that I could just

00:22:53.10 immediately do this can I get one let me see if I can get

00:22:57.05 one see if you can get one delivered while we're because we have that

00:23:01.04 I'm gonna leave right now to see if I can get one delivered I highly doubt

00:23:05.01 that I could get a [ __ ] lint 100

00:23:07.10 dark chocolate bar delivered in this moment but I will try I'll look into this

00:23:13.02 Gavin do you uh do you feel a bit like a failure because

00:23:17.10 you couldn't eat it uh yeah like you're not the chocolate fan you thought you

00:23:21.18 were thanks for asking I do feel like I would have read that disclaimer at the

00:23:26.22 bottom and would have been like ugh chocolate snobs I would have put that

00:23:30.13 absolutely in the stop category of people oh yes so before we move on to the uh

00:23:36.06 the important stuff I do have a clip to play oh

00:29:44.23 face that is join honey.com face Andrew you said uh yesterday that you

00:29:51.07 wanted to give a cosmic crisp update oh I do I have a brief update obviously

00:29:58.00 apple's the top fruit a top tier fruit I reach it's just it's not a substantial

00:30:03.11 but I did I reached out to the cosmic crisp people and I got a reply and I got

00:30:08.15 other contact information so we need to like figure out what we want to ask them

00:30:14.00 I guess request but we want apples that we can review

00:30:17.18 and talk about okay and also also we want to be listed as official spokespeople

00:30:22.04 uh for the the cosmic crisp see that's why I asked I just now we have yeah we

00:30:25.19 have a direct line you're making it sound like it was a brand new apple

00:30:29.05 though but apparently people have been eating them for years well they beta

00:30:32.08 tested around I'm sure like anything like I saw some people say hey

00:30:36.06 I live in Washington and we've had this apple for about a year it's really good

00:30:39.12 and then I've also heard other people say like yeah I've been drinking I've

00:30:43.03 been eating caramel crisp all year and it's like that's not the apple buddy

00:30:46.08 it's cosmic crisp you're confused I think a lot of people are confused

00:30:49.09 because they hear the word cosmic and they hear the word crisp because it's

00:30:50.21 the combination of two other apples I believe right so I think there's a lot

00:30:54.07 of people that think they're eating cosmic crisp because they recognized our

00:30:58.23 word not both words interesting if I'm eating are you gonna

00:31:02.02 you should get some apples Geoff I'm gonna eat this banana you need to get

00:31:06.02 some apples one yeah just like bite in and like

00:31:08.20 figure out the range of flavors and textures because it's crazy you don't

00:31:12.04 know you know it's funny I I have it listed right here as things to talk

00:31:16.10 about today uh apple rank I think that we should start ranking apples I think

00:31:21.10 this would be an interesting direction for us to go in we if we could create

00:31:26.08 like the official apple ranking guide so that people know

00:31:29.21 you know we could come up with like we could come up with texture flavor

00:31:33.21 crispiness whatever we determine and then we could become the authority on

00:31:37.23 apples I am a big fan of this apple is genuinely my favorite fruit

00:31:41.20 it's a great thing are you serious it's such a blessing fruit to me it's just so

00:31:45.19 chopped

00:31:51.18 they're great I'm with Gavin that's that's why that's why this is important

00:31:55.20 Andrew you're through your love of apples you're gonna you're gonna

00:31:59.12 introduce it to us and probably the rest

00:32:01.09 of the world who thinks that an apple is nothing more than a bog standard I I am

00:32:05.04 not going to take this [ __ I apple slander by a guy that can't eat a

00:32:08.17 chocolate bar someone who can't spell I'm not taking it right now apple is a

00:32:14.15 top tier number one fruit and it will be established it's a great juice it's a

00:32:18.10 great pie it's just great by itself it's portable it's fantastic in our text

00:32:23.08 conversation the other day I said uh apples this really annoyed you apple's a

00:32:28.12 fodder fruit it's the melon of a fruit salad of fruit

00:32:31.20 it's not what what is the problem with that statement for me I got a lot of

00:32:37.18 issues with it you're getting me wrapped up about apples

00:32:41.18 I [ __ ] love an apple when am I eating an apple in a fruit salad

00:32:44.23 like I would never want the melon is what I'd want the pineapple is great in

00:32:49.20 the fruit salad some grapes like there are so many great foods

00:32:53.12 wait is it wait what what do you say I got I got confused

00:32:56.23 while I was trying to think about what I was going to say while you were talking.

00:33:01.12 I was saying that one I don't feel like apple is in fruit salad no no the point

00:33:06.21 is is that in a fruit salad a melon is fodder melon

00:33:12.10 melon it's it takes up space you need it yeah you're ignorant

00:33:17.01 pineapple you're excited about the grapes in there that it's like it's like

00:33:22.06 melon whatever and I'm saying that uh apples are the melon of a fruit salad of

00:33:27.09 fruit I understand your point but I disagree about them being fodder I think

00:33:32.11 they're a key part of the fruit salad I think a fruit salad is a collection of

00:33:36.17 pieces together you have you're talking the melon I'm saying we're talking fruit

00:33:41.04 salad now now arguing about fruit salad I think the melon in a fruit salad is

00:33:45.01 important I don't think it's comparable at all to app now I will say in addition

00:33:49.04 to that I don't mind apple in a fruit salad I think actually that makes it a

00:33:52.17 little bit more exciting I feel like you never get an apple in a fruit salad

00:33:58.06 you do sometimes I feel like it's very rare you wanna you know what salad

00:34:01.19 grapes pineapple melon I hope I hope this isn't a controversial uh

00:34:05.19 strawberry uh but I you know what I like in a fruit

00:34:08.20 salad which I feel like isn't isn't always in there enough but uh it gets

00:34:12.03 overshadowed and should should shine a little bit more I like a pear in a fruit

00:34:16.10 salad a pear can be great I feel like a pear brings a whole other thing to the

00:34:20.02 table in a fruit salad I I agree with that but I would also say a pair on its

00:34:25.03 own wouldn't ever buy that you're never in the mood for a pear

00:34:28.22 I you know I I feel like I agree with Geoff I think the pear gets slept on I

00:34:32.22 think it's a better fruit than we give it credit for totally I've heard people

00:34:37.01 put some pear and a little bit like thinly

00:34:39.18 slice some pear and put it on a grilled cheese I think that would be interesting

00:34:43.11 I think that'd be a good combination to find out I've always wanted to try it it

00:34:47.07 sounds good a little bit the texture just a good texture unlike the banana

00:34:50.06 terrible texture well I they're very different textures both great in their

00:34:53.07 own right but also controversial textures a lot of people don't like pear

00:34:57.00 purely because of the sandy texture I think it's a string personally yeah I

00:35:01.10 see I feel like the banana is grittier and chalkier than the pear this chalk

00:35:05.13 analogy with the banana I just don't know what you're getting it from yeah

00:35:09.12 it's I I can't describe it either but it's just it's how I it's how I remember

00:35:13.20 but to be fair you guys are correct I don't think I've just eaten a banana off

00:35:18.12 the counter since I was maybe 10. It's probably been in 17 years because I

00:35:23.02 can't get one I don't have bananas why would I everyone has bananas I don't

00:35:27.14 have banana I don't like bananas I never buy bananas

00:35:30.04 no one in your family has them go get a [ __ ] apple Gavin right now everybody

00:35:33.21 has apples I got a dozen of them in my fridge go eat an apple you keep apples

00:35:38.00 in the fridge of course I do preserve them you put them in the fruit

00:35:42.21 crisper section the the drawer you put them oh no it's too cold

00:35:47.05 no it's not it doesn't need that maintains the crisp I'm a room

00:35:51.04 temperature apple guy you're when I am an apple guy what you're declaring is I

00:35:54.14 am a psychopath guy is what you're saying by saying that statement you do

00:35:59.14 not people need to be refrigerated man they preserve better well why you don't

00:36:03.15 buy as many how long are you holding on to these apples I'll buy like 12 apples

00:36:08.11 and I'll just eat them I'll eat them as I get

00:36:12.04 a cosmic crisp is going to last you a [ __ ] year that's true that is 12

00:36:15.22 apples will last 12 months I'm telling you I will go down in the fridge and

00:36:21.09 just go to town like a [ __ ] horse I will eat like you go down to apple town

00:36:26.10 I will go to apple town I love an apple it's great

00:36:29.23 this might be a divisive opinion not an apple or peanut butter guy

00:36:34.23 don't like those at all I don't like that

00:36:37.23 I love both independently it's a popular snack

00:36:41.10 don't like them together whenever I do it I end up just eating the peanut

00:36:45.14 butter by itself and the apple by itself two great things in the pen

00:36:49.18 you sounded so legitimately angry when you went I don't like it at all at all

00:36:54.12 there was so much emphasis there it's just genuine it's a genuine dislike

00:36:58.05 what's your go-to apple see I don't want

00:36:59.22 to say it because I don't want to put my apple on the spot if you have one if

00:37:03.16 you're going to write you you don't want to insult the cosmic crisp people

00:37:07.17 no well I've never had one so it's very possible the cosmic crisp could be I

00:37:11.18 haven't had the joy of tasting it yet I think it could be my favorite apple

00:37:15.21 definitely the granny smith it's a good it's a great apple the granny smith is a

00:37:21.03 fantastic apple right I put it in the top seven for sure of

00:37:25.02 apple types top seven top seven seven so there are potentially six apples you

00:37:31.01 like better how many apple types can you name off the top of your head uh

00:37:36.02 not many but I just I hope so the variety nah let's see we got I can name

00:37:41.05 ones I hate the [ __ I macintosh is a trash bottom tier app

00:37:45.05 I don't know if I want to reveal the other ones because I feel like all the

00:37:48.07 ones coming to mind right now that's greatest hits of apples and I don't want

00:37:51.15 to reveal my hand I don't want to it tip off in any way why don't you want to

00:37:55.22 show your athlete because I don't want Geoff to potentially be influenced or for

00:37:59.16 either of you to be like uh shitty apple like just to try to [ __ ] get under my

00:38:04.03 apple skin don't like he's right he's right because I absolutely will do that

00:38:09.00 and was planning on doing it no it's it's a good call Andrew I'm gonna you

00:38:12.14 should keep keep your apples close to your vest yeah I will I'll keep them in

00:38:16.05 my fridge actually is where I'm gonna keep them because it preserves pointless

00:38:19.12 that's that's pointless that's ridiculous you're just taking up

00:38:23.03 fridge space could somebody look up either Eric could you look up should I

00:38:27.01 be refrigerating my apples they're not you don't buy them

00:38:30.05 refrigerated no you don't but it like I think it extends their their ripeness if

00:38:34.22 it's in the fridge in the store stick it in the fridge

00:38:38.13 general rule I'm trying to think is is there an exception to that rule

00:38:43.20 outside of fruit for me bread I put my bread in the fridge too yes there are

00:38:49.05 items that say uh refrigerate upon opening so like barbecue sauce [ __ ] like

00:38:53.09 that you can buy it on the shelf but then once you open it has to be

00:38:57.14 refrigerated so by the way have we just talked about

00:39:02.04 apples and bananas for 40 minutes we have but also

00:39:06.04 the last two episodes were pretty apple happy as well

00:39:09.00 okay yeah man you know what I need to advise eric's I'm gonna do more research

00:39:13.03 beyond this but Eric sent the thing that says apple should be stored

00:39:16.21 unrefrigerated for about seven days after perches apple's refrigerator too

00:39:20.12 soon lose flavor and sweetness oh that could be wrong I've been cutting

00:39:24.13 off your apples at the flavor knees for years you know what's you know what that

00:39:28.11 though that's a [ __ ] statement about how delicious apples are because if I've

00:39:32.11 been [ __ ] chopping them at the knees for years if I still have them a 9 out

00:39:37.09 of 10 they're going to be [ __ ] 10 in handicapped apples and they're still

00:39:40.21 good yeah they've been reduced qualitied apples and they're still top

00:39:45.08 tier for me it's an a plus top of the mouth you know what you're about to do

00:39:48.21 you're about to you're gonna expand your whole world is

00:39:51.17 about to open up when you get a full flavored apple oh it's gonna be like

00:39:56.01 scene color for the first time I assume yeah it's gonna be life changing I can't

00:40:00.06 just feel like storage aside I just want to bite into a cold apple I feel like

00:40:03.12 it'd be if you're like biting a lump of ice cream which is like

00:40:08.05 I don't they don't get that cold

00:40:10.23 no they're not frozen that's a terrible comparison well like a a cold strawberry

00:40:16.08 it's it's too cold like like if you get chocolate covered strawbs

00:40:20.15 need them out of the fridge for at least an hour what about a frozen strawberry

00:40:24.16 though you're getting it I feel like a frozen strawberry could be good dude

00:40:28.07 frozen strawberries are very good see I've been eating them I've been eating

00:40:31.07 them lately look at that they sell them that uh they sell like this little

00:40:34.23 frozen strawberry thing at uh trader joe's they're [ __ ] yummy hey do you

00:40:38.07 guys think we should get off of fruit for a minute and switch gears or should

00:40:41.20 we just that's fine we could switch I can I have

00:40:44.14 a question like unrelated just very quick and I know it's something you want

00:40:47.22 to talk about and I apologize because it's possible we've already discussed it

00:40:52.04 and I forgot but I don't think that knob related um no no no it's not bat not

00:40:56.02 related at all okay has nothing to do with that you're gonna be excited when I

00:40:59.16 bring this up and I apologize if we've covered it and I just don't remember

00:41:03.16 you mentioned I want to say last episode maybe it was two episodes ago that you

00:41:07.12 were really into like two things that you're very excited about these things

00:41:10.20 and one of them was koozies yeah koozies and pastrami I'm a pastami dude I'm

00:41:14.20 going to get pastrami this weekend wake up early Saturday morning get

00:41:19.09 pastrami before f1

00:41:19.09 dude I was talking about it last night with my mom my mom was in town and my

00:41:23.12 aunt and I went [ __ ] a dude I spent like

00:41:26.17 an hour talking to him about pastrami yeah really like mostly dude

00:41:31.11 I think that's wonderful he's like mom mom

00:41:38.10 and you never gave me pastrami like what are you doing

00:41:42.21 but you depriving me of pastrami for four decades so much like last time you

00:41:47.22 brought up these two things and I feel like I listen to you yell about pastrami

00:41:52.14 for like 15 minutes and which is awesome I don't think I know why you like

00:41:56.12 koozies and why this is like a big thing I don't think you ever explained that

00:42:01.20 why are you super into koozies uh because I I my girlfriend gave me one

00:42:07.03 and it was the kind that lays flat and I don't know I just threw it on the

00:42:12.17 counter and one day I put it on a soda and then my uh I liked the heft of it I

00:42:16.22 liked how squishy it made my hand when I was drinking my soda kept my hand dry I

00:42:21.20 got to look at the the logo of the thing that was on it and remind me that I was

00:42:25.18 a fan of that thing and it it folded flat and I was able to put it in my back

00:42:30.13 pocket and I like the heft of having a koozie it's like a little added padded

00:42:34.08 packet like a little uh like a little cushion for my butt instead it's like

00:42:39.09 the opposite of a back wallet it's like a it's like you put a koozie in each

00:42:42.17 pocket and you're sitting better okay so you just really enjoyed the experience

00:42:46.23 there was there's not just like this yeah dude top to bottom I just like I

00:42:50.23 just never it's been it's been like that lately with me I've just been finding

00:42:54.05 awesome new things that I didn't know about just today I was putting my

00:42:57.07 headphones on to get ready for this podcast and I remembered that when I got

00:43:01.12 these headphones for Christmas three years ago they were Bluetooth headphones

00:43:05.10 and I just never synced them up and I was just using the cord the whole time

00:43:08.12 and I thought I could do that and I just wouldn't have a cord anymore and I'm

00:43:12.11 listening to you guys on cordless headphones now it's just every day

00:43:16.15 there's something better something new that's just like making my life easier

00:43:22.08 pastrami koozies Bluetooth is great I don't know if I

00:43:25.09 trust Bluetooth with you I feel like it's not so much now I feel like there's

00:43:29.10 a real phase of you everything being broken and I know I'm one to talk I had

00:43:32.20 my technical difficulties too for a stretch but you with Bluetooth like

00:43:36.21 removing the core do you know where the cord is at least

00:43:39.18 yeah I found it I set it somewhere and three years ago and I found it

00:43:43.20 immediately I went I bet I put it here and it was there

00:43:46.19 fantastic that's great I'm glad you're discovering new things

00:43:50.08 should we talk about some of the other stuff we had planned because I just

00:43:53.08 realized that we've been recording for like 43 minutes and we've only talked

00:43:57.10 about apples essentially we're we're about so we had one two three four if I

00:44:02.08 had seven things on the list and we've talked about it

00:44:05.08 kind of like I guess two of them should we remove some of the apple stuff have

00:44:08.20 we talked about anything about an apple no I we've talked about a few things

00:44:13.03 yeah we have bananas you want to just float oh we have chocolate

00:44:17.11 let's yeah let's mix things up all right let's switch gears Andrew you want to

00:44:20.11 talk about nuggets you have nugget content dude okay are we just gonna lean

00:44:25.03 food heavy in this we're just gonna go full this is just sounds like a show at

00:44:30.12 this point I have I'm going to redeem this is my redemption year Gavin this is

00:44:36.12 this is a year of redemption for me I've

00:44:39.01 lost the burgers three times I tried did my best couldn't do it

00:44:43.07 I am now redeeming myself though again we're changing it up we're going with

00:44:46.15 nuggets oh interesting we're going nuggets are the future and I will I will

00:44:51.20 get first before before you even go on can I just say up front that this is a

00:44:57.01 terrible idea continue okay well now let

00:45:00.19 me explain the idea this is I honestly I had this idea

00:45:03.22 uh last year during the last game of this team's playoff run they got

00:45:08.08 eliminated the day after so I've been sitting on this for a while there is a

00:45:13.07 basketball team called the Denver nuggets I want to out nugget the nuggets

00:45:17.17 I want wanna eat more nuggets than the nuggets score points in a game and

00:45:23.01 embarrass their franchise so I'm planning on this we're doing this

00:45:26.14 on what day is it I I'm gonna do the uh it's the Friday October 29th they have a

00:45:31.19 7 p.m pacific game against the Dallas mavericks at the nuggets home I will eat

00:45:36.17 more nuggets within the regulation of the game than the nuggets score points

00:45:41.00 I'm very confident about this what if you were to pick a team with a better

00:45:45.03 defense like the Utah jazz like a team that's gonna lock down the nuggets and I

00:45:49.14 mean this is there's a 20 there's a 20

00:45:51.18 nugget swing going here probably uh depending on which team you pick I'm not

00:45:55.13 worried about that at all Geoff I I genuinely much like the chocolate I

00:46:00.04 don't think this will be an issue I got nugget confidence uh for this so

00:46:04.11 what's the average what's the average score in a basketball

00:46:08.21 game that's a great question yeah I ca beyond the average score the

00:46:14.04 Denver nuggets averaged 115.5

00:46:16.04 points per game last season that was your average so we're looking at 116.

00:46:21.09 It's a weird sport uh so you're going to get like how many how

00:46:25.09 many are you going to buy you're going to have them all up front I'm assuming

00:46:28.20 no this is so that's another fantastic question by you it doesn't make sense I

00:46:34.13 should not be able to score points while the nuggets have the ball so I can only

00:46:38.17 eat the nuggets when Dallas has the ball it's the only time I can only gain

00:46:42.17 points on them when Dallas has possession I cannot just be eating

00:46:47.09 nuggets constantly I'm only allowed to score when Dallas has the ball

00:46:51.12 so in a so in a two-hour basketball game you only have access to approximately

00:46:56.00 one hour of nugget eating time potentially we'll see how the game flow

00:46:59.13 goes but yeah I'm gonna I'm expecting now anticipating how we need 116. Here's

00:47:05.07 a question for you yes uh is this a nationally televised game I

00:47:09.02 have no idea I'm assuming something okay but I don't know well if it's a

00:47:12.02 nationally televised game there'll be there'll be a half time show will you be

00:47:16.06 able to eat during the halftime show like so maybe maybe during nuggets

00:47:20.03 highlights or something or like during Dallas highlights okay so just without

00:47:24.12 bounce what if it's like between stuff what do you mean when it's out of bounds

00:47:29.00 if it okay so if if Dallas loses the ball out of bounds I immediately have to

00:47:33.09 stop does but the ball has to be in play the ball has to be in play that's even

00:47:38.01 less time what about during a timeout called by Dallas and they maintain

00:47:42.19 possession no I can't score they can't if the team can't score points then I

00:47:47.16 can't score points okay so they score three points let's say yeah then uh

00:47:53.05 the ball goes to the other team right you're explaining basketball

00:47:56.21 yeah I'm just trying to so you are you then gonna immediately be stuffing your

00:48:00.04 face as soon as Dallas gets possession of the

00:48:03.00 ball I gotta go I gotta go go go go go I gotta I'll be like [ __ ] Geoff's

00:48:06.13 vacation guide it's gonna be a go now scenario of chew those are you gonna go

00:48:11.03 now through those nuggets yeah so are you competing in this scenario against

00:48:16.19 Dallas or no the nuggets or no I'm the Dallas is a representation of me

00:48:21.04 yeah he is Dallas yeah you are downloading this in this scenario going

00:48:25.02 up again okay going against the Denver nuggets I'm gonna out nugget the nuggets

00:48:29.12 it's gonna be great and are you gonna be okay are you gonna get any source

00:48:33.11 involved see now this is a very interesting thing that I wanted to bring

00:48:37.12 up and nick even also asked what is the nugget to point ratio because in

00:48:41.09 basketball you're typically your average score is worth two points and there's a

00:48:45.07 three-point play free throws worth one I am I in my head I always assumed one

00:48:51.03 nugget equaled one point equivalent of right one but I am open to the idea of

00:48:56.00 like a three-point nugget but I just don't know what that looks I don't know

00:48:59.04 if that's like if I have to dip it in insanely hot hot sauce if that's the

00:49:03.09 three-point nugget like what what would I have to do it obviously has to be a

00:49:07.18 tougher experience to replicate the equivalent of a

00:49:11.04 three-point nugget how about us go ahead go ahead

00:49:16.15 how about all right I'll go how about uh you know you know that's we very rarely

00:49:22.08 have that [ __ ] happen considering we're an audio only podcast that records

00:49:25.16 remotely um it's uh pretty impressive it's way worse than the other ones I do

00:49:30.06 what if you just like I like the one-to-one ratio because it makes the

00:49:33.14 most sense for math and you're not having to do any kind of translation or

00:49:36.21 figuring [ __ ] out on the fly so what if

00:49:39.03 for a three-point nugget you just had to put all three nuggets in your mouth at

00:49:43.09 the same time no I don't see I think it could be I agree like

00:49:48.09 I'm very mixed cause I I'm not I can't tolerate hot sauce at all so if we get a

00:49:54.08 super hot hot sauce if it it would genuinely be

00:49:56.18 a desperation move by me if I was trailing in points in the last thing and

00:50:02.02 I think that could be funny yeah but here's the deal here's what I see

00:50:05.10 happening down the road you fail the challenge and you blame the hot sauce

00:50:10.00 not the nuggets quantity which is what we're going to

00:50:13.10 disagree with because we're going to think that the quantity of nuggets is

00:50:16.15 overwhelming you're going to when when you fail at this inevitably you're going

00:50:20.09 to blame other things like hot sauce being too much for you to handle but

00:50:23.13 it's really going to be the nuggets I'd like to eliminate I this competition is

00:50:27.12 you versus the nuggets nugget to nugget I think it should I think I think which

00:50:31.03 should be simple yeah I'm very excited for this for this to

00:50:34.21 take place I'm just also like as I'm asking questions I'm also thinking about

00:50:39.05 how he's gonna Andrew panton this like how's he gonna sell it

00:50:42.23 now I think honestly I disagree with your analysis that I blame the sauce and

00:50:46.14 be like I could have eaten the nugget I would only go to that sauce if I felt

00:50:51.02 like I couldn't I was running out of time and that I just was like I was

00:50:54.23 [ __ ] it would be most likely in my head not a time issue actually as much

00:50:59.02 as it is a I can't eat this many nuggets I'm gonna need to start getting bonus

00:51:04.02 nugs off of every nug that's when I would pivot to the sauce

00:51:07.20 in my head so I don't think I'd ever excuse that but I I agree with what you

00:51:11.12 said I like the integrity of a nugget being one point I think that's truly out

00:51:16.21 nuggeting the nuggets if I eat genuinely more nuggets than they score points I

00:51:20.12 agree with that hey gav yeah what nugget count do you think he throws in the

00:51:24.08 towel oh well I'm trying to think of how many I cause I I find nuggets get

00:51:28.10 extremely samey after I've had like five I'm just like ugh I'm done with them

00:51:34.08 I think around 60 he's going to be really feeling it I was gonna say 72

00:51:38.17 he's going to tap out at 72 nuggets 72

00:51:41.11 we'll see I bet you every time the first time I did the

00:51:45.20 burger challenge I was so confident and I literally realized my issues one bite

00:51:51.03 in so I'm curious to see if I hit that wall and if at what point

00:51:54.14 with the how many bites of burger do you think you got down what do you mean on

00:51:59.16 which one on which attempt your best attempt my best attempt I ate

00:52:03.17 like 42 burgers how many bites was that I had I don't know how to translate

00:52:08.17 burger to bite I mean were you doing like five bites per burger

00:52:12.02 I have never measured in bites per berg before so I have no idea

00:52:16.06 how what's a nugget to you are you all in I could do well like what do you mean

00:52:21.09 like how many are you doing two chumps per nug or you

00:52:24.03 just nuggets two a nuggets two bites I don't know I could yeah no I think it's

00:52:28.14 more than two bites I mean I could throw the whole nugget in my mouth it just as

00:52:32.14 a whole but it's like how many times does it take to chew to swallow I don't

00:52:36.04 know yeah I've never considered that I'm not worried about how many times I'm

00:52:39.09 just yeah how many chomps of the actual nug how many bites but I feel like if

00:52:42.21 you do put the entire thing in you're gonna get less sauce which might be a

00:52:46.02 bonus see I don't know if I'll use sauce because that could take up space is my

00:52:49.21 whole thing with the sauce it's also like we're not even talking about the

00:52:53.06 fact of maintaining temperature on the nuggets how many nuggets do I order at

00:52:57.16 one time yeah I was about to say can I make a recommendation they're going to

00:53:01.11 get harder to eat the more room temperature they become I if I were you

00:53:06.04 I would order them via competing services at a in a tiered manner so that

00:53:10.11 they're arriving hot like every 30

00:53:12.06 minutes or something so I think what I'm going to do is I'm going to order 60 up

00:53:15.23 front and I'm going to go all mcdonald's nuggets I'm going to go 60 mcdonald's

00:53:19.15 nuggets and then order another 60 as soon as half starts okay because that

00:53:23.19 could be another that would be honestly how I enjoy painting it if I run out of

00:53:27.05 nuggets that would be the yeah excuse me you

00:53:30.18 don't want your nuggets stuck in traffic no I don't

00:53:34.00 it was a good point terrible yeah just watching so it's like how long is a half

00:53:38.12 time like 15 minutes 10 minutes like I need to factor that into of ordering

00:53:42.02 your time that perfectly I do because you don't want to be running around

00:53:46.07 barefoot outside when the game's on no pick up your next nug absolutely not

00:53:51.11 nothing is worse oh [ __ ] and it's going to be it's going to be dark outside at

00:53:55.08 that point it starts at

00:53:58.04 why didn't you get the second batch just in the oven on on like a low preheat I

00:54:03.20 feel like that'll dry him out I feel like that might dry him out that's why

00:54:07.20 maybe not if you cover it um okay well you know I honestly I'll probably

00:54:12.16 I'll make sure I have enough nuggets we're gonna I'm gonna crush the Denver

00:54:16.01 nuggets that's all I'm saying I don't think I could go past 30 I predict 60

00:54:21.01 for Andrew I don't think he's gonna get over a hundred I could do 40

00:54:24.13 he'll get 72. How uh well I'm sorry Andrew what day is this again October 29th

00:54:29.14 17th that's pretty soon that's pretty exciting it is it's nine days from now

00:54:34.12 oh man uh so we're probably getting fairly close

00:54:40.00 to the end I wanted to mention I had this idea I posed to the uh slack the

00:54:45.07 other day and everybody seemed to like it so I was gonna bring it up here and

00:54:48.18 pose it to the audience uh it struck me that we should probably create some sort

00:54:52.17 of a regulation face shirt I just don't know what that would be

00:54:56.03 oh I should just say regulation shirt on it shouldn't it you should just say

00:54:59.11 regulation face shirt like on the breast or something does it even need to say

00:55:03.08 the name of the show I think it might just just say regulations

00:55:08.08 yeah I like that just on the on the pocket

00:55:11.05 or is it even a pocket I don't know I feel like it's just a cross and like

00:55:16.07 kind of bigger letters regulation shirt what color is the shirt

00:55:20.10 what's a regulation color in my head it's black with a white font but I'd

00:55:25.10 like that isn't as important to me in my head it was the other way around

00:55:28.22 it was white with a black font I'm fine with either of this I think one of each

00:55:34.17 do multiple okay Eric can you can you investigate that

00:55:37.20 for us Geoff can you put a sticker on every one of these shirts please

00:55:41.13 can we sell it uh depends on how many it depends on how many we sell

00:55:46.17 potentially sure have signing your name on balls with the bat

00:55:51.11 thing well no because I've been in Florida the whole time uh and then I got

00:55:55.22 home uh right as my mom and my aunt got here so I spent the weekend with them uh

00:56:00.03 and also the audience is gonna be pissed

00:56:01.23 off uh next episode because I won't have hit the ball or throw the ball by then

00:56:06.08 either because we're about to record it in eight seconds I apologize for that

00:56:11.09 uh but no I listen I'm gonna [ __ ] I'm gonna hit a thousand baseballs we just

00:56:17.16 gotta get them made I feel extra I have some extreme

00:56:22.00 extreme baseball bat confidence on the thousand I have

00:56:25.16 I have uh b plus confidence on the baseball throw I I will admit that my

00:56:31.07 body has been frustrating me and uh a little bit here and there but I don't

00:56:34.10 think it'll impede me swinging the bat a thousand times it's definitely going to

00:56:37.12 cause some issues with throwing the ball

00:56:39.06 but that's okay that's okay we'll figure it out

00:56:42.02 right what's the worst that could happen

00:56:44.07 honestly okay so just a quick on a scale of one to a hundred Geoff how confident

00:56:48.12 are you that you could swing at a thousand baseballs and one thing 100100

00:56:52.19 confidence I am 100 confident I could do the nugget thing now Gavin you rank the

00:56:57.16 likelihood of each of those things actually happening being successful um

00:57:02.10 in what format am I ranking like percentage one to a hundred yeah

00:57:07.02 percentage confident the odds of them actually being completed

00:57:11.08 what we're claiming will happen I would put your nugs at 40 confidence okay

00:57:16.10 that's pretty good it's higher than I put I put Geoff hitting a thousand bulls

00:57:22.10 at 20. Now what if it was swinging it's not necessarily hitting

00:57:26.03 he's swinging at a thousand 25 okay there you go see what I just did

00:57:30.19 for you Geoff it's got you five points okay well well

00:57:34.04 now you've now you've motivated me to crush together got it thank you and I

00:57:38.13 and I would put my confidence in eating in an entire chocolate bar at zero

00:57:43.18 percent for me I can't wait your next one I can't get it

00:57:48.00 I would put that even lower than your ducks oh that is outrageous I don't like

00:57:53.08 dark chocolate I'm very excited next I guess we're doing this next week we're

00:57:56.17 about to record the second one the one after that one I'm eating some [ __ ]

00:57:59.16 chocolate and it's gonna go great I'm I'm also gonna post nuggets

00:58:04.08 yeah that's true unless it's gonna be a lot of jazz

00:58:06.21 I'm really jazzed about this this next this the one after the one we're about

00:58:10.04 to record because it's gonna have a lot of it's gonna have what I'm guessing are

00:58:13.14 gonna be some classic face bits in it uh realized after all this but let's not

00:58:19.09 sleep on next episode because next episode I think we're gonna get to the

00:58:22.12 superhero thing finally yep and also I uh I want to pitch to you guys uh I sent

00:58:28.04 you guys some texts while I was in Florida about uh some ideas I had for

00:58:33.18 some revolutionary new uh products similar uh within the same vein of a

00:58:38.08 too spicy icy and a beef bracelet maybe the next time you find that lineage

00:58:43.14 brought well brought to us by uniform uniform combining the power of one with

00:58:49.03 the fabric of the farm uniform yes [Laughter]
