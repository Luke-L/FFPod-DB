00:00:23.05 [Music]

00:00:31.16 [Music]

00:00:37.07 Is this place did we start yeah I think we started welcome to okay episode 74

00:00:42.08 there we go it started no it's 7575

00:00:46.08 part two act seven season three two what season are we season two year two

00:00:53.20 episode how many episodes of season one and how

00:00:57.23 many episodes are we into for season two uh

00:01:01.04 I don't expect anyone to actually know I'm just kind of saying that we have the

00:01:05.06 mid-season finale yet that's the thing did you so when I got Disney plus one of

00:01:09.19 the most fascinating things was seeing how they did seasons for kids shows

00:01:14.06 there will be like 700 episodes in season one and then season two is six

00:01:18.12 like I don't know how they decide that line I feel like that's what we're doing

00:01:22.10 we'll have a million episodes in season three and season four will be four just

00:01:28.06 break it up have it be completely uneven

00:01:31.01 nonsensical which fits for the show yeah that's true speaking of fitting for the

00:01:34.08 show uh does anybody have any fruit related content they wanted to throw out

00:01:38.21 I don't but I will fruit it out I will fruit fruited out I am equally fruited

00:01:44.19 out but I do have a very serious question for Gavin and I've talked to

00:01:49.22 this this blew my mind and I shouldn't even t when do you think the high five

00:01:55.13 was invented Gavin we did talk about this yesterday what yeah

00:02:00.02 what year do you think the high five was invented um 600 the year

00:02:06.21 600 that's your guess a d or b c yeah that's another great a.d

00:02:13.12 who doesn't specify bc so in your so you so in your mind assuming uh Jesus

00:02:20.19 existed he existed in a world without a high five

00:02:27.03 okay just wanna make sure oh so it's gonna be way earlier than that um I

00:02:32.00 don't know I'm just curious well I feel like were people really

00:02:36.14 tracking that in you know if it was 2500 bc would anyone be like [Laughter]

00:02:46.06 uh oh [ __ ] I have no okay I'm gonna re-guess okay go ahead 10

00:02:54.21 10. [Music]

00:03:01.16 You're so wrong so far off I thought you did

00:03:05.22 I thought you'd get closer on the second one you got further and there wasn't a

00:03:11.11 lot of room to get further away but you did it.

00:03:16.13 I was watching so for context I was watching a playoff baseball game between

00:03:21.14 the Houston astros and the white sox and uh the [ __ ] astros by the way [ __ ]

00:03:27.05 The asterisks the announcers in like late in the game just randomly throw out

00:03:32.20 like ah yeah manager of the astros dusty baker inventor of the high five

00:03:38.06 dusty baker apparently invented the high five in 1977 Gavin

00:03:43.11 absolutely not that's the people were like storming normandy

00:03:50.19 before the high five yeah high five was not a popular thing they

00:03:55.12 had they were storming normandy with no way to celebrate

00:03:59.12 they just they did it they got through and they were just like oh yay I guess

00:04:05.06 they they just shook hands it was the low fight now that's the

00:04:08.20 thing the low five has been around since the 20s I believe in the history

00:04:14.02 research that I've done he's saying that no one before that never just

00:04:18.23 no no no no two hats together no no now that's that's another device a point now

00:04:24.09 there yeah dusty baker is the most common like inventor of it there are

00:04:28.19 other documentations of high fives before that point but I don't think they

00:04:32.15 were called the high five and I don't think it was like their thing it was

00:04:36.13 maybe a thing they did once so he just named the i5 no he didn't name it he I

00:04:42.06 would argue they popular here I'm just going to read you

00:04:44.15 an excerpt of the first high five that happened okay

00:04:48.04 the conventional wisdom has been that the origin of the high five occurred

00:04:53.03 between dusty baker and Glenn Burke of the la dodgers at dodger stadium October

00:04:57.03 2nd 1977. How did they both know how to do it no this I'm getting to that the

00:05:02.04 last day of the regular season in the sixth inning dusty baker hit a home run

00:05:06.23 off Houston astros pitcher j.r Richard is baker's 30th home run making the

00:05:11.01 dodgers the first team in history to have four hitters with at least 30 home

00:05:14.18 runs it was a wild triumphant moment and

00:05:18.00 a good omen as the dodgers headed to the

00:05:20.17 playoffs Burke waited on deck thrust his hand enthusiastically over his head to

00:05:25.03 greet his friend at the plate baker not knowing what to do smacked it in quotes

00:05:29.13 his hand was up in the air and he was arch way back says baker so I reached up

00:05:34.23 and hit his hand it seemed like the thing to do that is the original

00:05:42.19 no one had ever done a high five and he wasn't left hanging it blew my mind

00:05:48.02 no there are other people like I've read a thing that apparently magic Johnson

00:05:52.16 also claims that he invented the high five in like 1978 there are different

00:05:56.21 stories there are different origins there are different things he could

00:05:59.23 point to but the most popular rise version the most popularized invention

00:06:04.22 or the person who invented it is dusty baker dusty baker's credited as the high

00:06:10.00 five guy I'm blown away I was blown away I was telling Andrew it's kind of like

00:06:14.06 how uh the the mullet uh hairstyle has been around for a very

00:06:18.19 very long time it was super popular in the 80s but it wasn't called the mullet

00:06:24.07 until the beastie boys did it in 1994.

00:06:27.06 I was in the army before the mullet became the mullet and you would I would

00:06:31.13 assume that was like a hundred years ago so imagine the Beatles um they're

00:06:35.22 they're all just got out of a car there's a big crowd waiting for him the

00:06:39.03 crowd they've all got their hands in there the Beatles just walked by yeah

00:06:43.08 they don't know not been invented yet it's not a thing that's yeah hasn't been

00:06:47.05 invented yet nobody knows maybe it may be a low five maybe a low five very much

00:06:51.21 invented popularized yeah they're nonsense not the high five the high five

00:06:56.01 is a relatively new creation I was way off you were way off and then you went

00:07:01.03 even further away that's fantastic I was thinking of like

00:07:05.07 schools I was like when was the first school [Laughter]

00:07:10.00 they're just located oh my god I can say something that y'all can't say

00:07:14.19 I am older than the high five you are [Laughter]

00:07:19.20 wow I what year did you say the beastie boys

00:07:23.01 coined the term mullet 1994 so I'm the same age as the mullet you're the same

00:07:28.00 age as the mullet and I'm two years older than the high five yeah [Music]

00:07:33.13 I feel like if you said that people would think damn he looks good for his h

00:07:38.06 if you're like I'm two years older than a high five nobody would assume

00:07:42.00 like you're 70 you look great for 70.

00:07:44.09 What do you think the next thing will be then so there's potentially

00:07:47.18 going to be something in the future more universal than the high five but it

00:07:51.01 hasn't happened yet I mean covet has been a terrible thing for the high five

00:07:56.12 it has really hurt the the popularity I would assume

00:07:59.11 here's what I think I think that it provides and this actually dovetails

00:08:02.15 into something that I'm going to talk about later uh but this I think that

00:08:06.02 there is uh there's a market for the next thing and we've already identified

00:08:11.00 that uh that it wasn't that long ago that you

00:08:14.21 could flip the world on its shoulders uh by cr slapping two hands together so

00:08:20.03 I think it's up to us to determine what the new high five is and to popularize

00:08:25.08 it it has to be simple it has to be it's got to be simple when was that

00:08:29.04 playground game invented where the kids would like

00:08:31.18 you know you're like yourself and then you clap the other person's hand then

00:08:34.23 you clap oh school girls yeah that was uh October

00:08:39.15 24th 1967 like what do you [ __ ] mean when did it come out like I was surely

00:08:43.21 way before the high five but they're high fiving left and right in there no

00:08:47.22 it's like a mid five a midfield patty cake that's a chess five that's a

00:08:52.15 chess pass five yeah maybe that's what it is maybe maybe the chest five no

00:08:59.01 maybe we popularized the mid five like our high five our height we've been

00:09:03.23 flying a little too high the last like the hubris alone the last 40 years or so

00:09:09.07 like maybe we need to take it down a notch

00:09:11.03 physically metaphorically metaphysically maybe we should start mid-fiving you

00:09:15.11 know what I mean now do we need to do like it's back of the hand like two

00:09:18.21 backs of the hands for the high five because I feel like it needs to

00:09:21.18 mechanically be different than just a high five but then again the low five to

00:09:25.08 high five same thing mechanically so maybe we don't ma I think maybe touching

00:09:31.03 hands going forward is a problem because of germs and stuff

00:09:33.23 who invented the fist bump that's what yeah I was going to say I

00:09:36.21 don't know who invented the fist bump I read dusty baker encouraging long

00:09:40.05 distance high fives which I feel like you only say if you're the inventor of

00:09:43.06 the high five and you really want to yeah you're just it's just stretched the

00:09:47.12 long distance high five is a stretch yeah who invented the fisma I don't know

00:09:52.04 that's a great question we just need to figure out what the next thing is people

00:09:57.01 do elbow touches well I mean we're doing the jet ski one we're gonna yeah

00:10:02.08 I'd love to see somebody do a home run and then do a jet ski five we're gonna

00:10:05.23 we're definitely gonna elevate the high five but we need to be thinking of what

00:10:09.16 the new high five is that then we can take credit for and popularize right

00:10:14.15 like dusty baker did we like maybe it's like an uh like uh knee knock you just

00:10:20.19 walk up and like I don't know I don't I don't like that

00:10:23.13 maybe a toe touch but then that's how dudes find each other in bathrooms at

00:10:27.11 the airport so maybe that could be confusing I don't know wait what

00:10:31.01 oh you don't know about that yeah like there's been a bunch of uh politicians

00:10:34.02 that have gotten caught doing it in the past uh was a popular thing to do

00:10:37.19 uh when it wasn't as uh well well for people that are closeted uh or it wasn't

00:10:42.02 as socially acceptable to to be out and and proud and gay uh dudes sometimes

00:10:46.14 would go into certain bathrooms and you would sit on the stall and then you

00:10:48.08 would like touch the foot or like stick your foot under the thing and then if

00:10:52.00 the other guy touched it then you would know that that

00:10:55.05 and you were into the same stuff and then you could get to know each other

00:10:59.05 yeah it was a I think a senator or a congressman got caught doing it in the

00:11:04.19 90s earlier was that just like a reporter taking a [ __ ] and then

00:11:09.03 I think I think I think the I think somebody yeah I think something like

00:11:12.21 that I just know that that's a thing that was was done

00:11:16.02 so we well first off let's let's take it

00:11:18.15 back for a minute what is a high what is the expression of a high five what are

00:11:22.11 you trying to convey with a high five oh it's celebration right like celebration

00:11:27.20 and excitement somebody has achieved a good thing yeah

00:11:31.14 because I typically I relate it to sports but it could be beyond that I

00:11:34.14 think it's just so you're celebrating the act of someone you you could

00:11:38.21 high-five cooking good bread it could be anything but so exactly yeah so we we

00:11:44.23 need to we need to find the new the 2021 to lead us into

00:11:49.03 the future to leave to so that we're 2050 when people are still doing it we

00:11:54.08 need to find the new thing that's uh a way to express ourselves physically with

00:11:58.20 another person that is simple and safe and doesn't transmit uh germs and

00:12:03.09 diseases but is still super cool and hip

00:12:05.13 and fun and maybe makes noise because if

00:12:07.09 you do a good high five there's a pretty awesome slap the slap is so satisfying

00:12:12.03 that's my biggest issue with the long distance high five is the best part is

00:12:16.04 that contact doesn't work otherwise I agree I I feel

00:12:19.04 like this could be a great thing for the comment levers to help figure out they

00:12:22.18 want to submit pitches like that could be you could move sounds

00:12:26.15 like Geoff's already figured it out do you because I I feel like what so

00:12:30.00 what is it a mid-five is that what we're talking about no I don't think it's a

00:12:33.14 mid-five I don't know what it is I just I just I just think that you you start

00:12:36.21 at the beginning and you figure out what you're trying to do and then go from

00:12:40.02 there what we're trying to do is find a new way to celebrate an accomplishment

00:12:44.06 or an exciting moment uh without being living in the past or paying royalties

00:12:47.07 to dusty baker and it needs a sound yeah it doesn't gotta have a sound yeah and

00:12:51.03 it has most likely contact less so that's another layer too

00:12:55.09 I think we should have it be contact less just workshop this covers everything

00:12:59.12 there's no scenario at that point where you couldn't do it can you guys do that

00:13:02.17 thing where you put your finger in your mouth and play this

00:13:06.12 maybe we do that you just walk yeah just walk next time you want to high five

00:13:10.13 just go at the same time make some noise let's try not to uh

00:13:14.22 spread them say everyone put your finger in your mouth and then and then

00:13:20.15 then fish rake it out yeah maybe that's not the best one we'll

00:13:25.13 put our fingers in each other's mouths that's not bad that's interesting

00:13:30.01 if you can if you can make that noise in someone else's mouth

00:13:34.21 I'd be very impressed

00:13:39.12 what's more impressive eating an entire bar of 100 in the chocolate or whatever

00:13:45.13 that was or I think if you could first time put your finger in someone's mouth

00:13:50.10 and make the pop sound that's way more impressive can I try on you uh oh

00:13:56.02 well you got to wash you got to wash your finger first yeah I thought that

00:14:01.11 that was assumed but let's yeah we'll we'll we can

00:14:04.16 we can discuss the ground rules ahead of time if you want to but I assumed I

00:14:08.16 would wash my hands what if I put on a glove what if I put on a bullet like a

00:14:12.06 like a rubber glove yeah I think the extra grip might cause the noise to

00:14:16.10 change though um well we'll figure this we can cover this

00:14:20.13 when we were in person thrown back imagine if we both put our fingers in

00:14:25.16 each other's mouths and then got a double pop that at the same time

00:14:30.13 in a post-covered world will be the ultimate high five

00:14:34.21 I don't know if I've ever respected Gavin more than him Geoff suggesting that

00:14:39.09 he put a glove on to put hands in your mouth and your response was it might

00:14:44.13 damage the sound it might break the integrity of the pop [Laughter]

00:14:50.04 we should also make sure we cut our fingernails

00:14:54.08 oh that's another yeah that's important yeah oh

00:14:58.08 I'm I'm honestly I'm so up for trying that

00:15:01.00 I am too I'm pretty excited about it to be honest with you.

00:15:05.16 I'm sitting here practicing so should we

00:15:08.17 talk about like one of the actual things we planned on talking about and not

00:15:13.14 because we're like almost 20 minutes into dusty baker we

00:15:17.16 talked about the high five why is that so funny to me

00:15:21.22 no it's pretty [ __ ] funny [Laughter]

00:15:27.16 Oh Andrew Geoff Andrew Geoff a long time ago you came to me a long time ago now

00:15:37.11 uh it feels like six months ago yeah at least like three three or four months

00:15:42.02 ago it's probably like you came to me you came to me with something that you

00:15:45.17 read that I thought was insane and then we started talking about it and I think

00:15:50.23 we came up with a brilliant idea and then we teased it and then other

00:15:55.20 important apple related things got in the way

00:15:58.13 and uh fast forward to like months of banana content later and here we are do

00:16:04.02 you want to explain what? What superheroes means and how it

00:16:08.00 relates to face so yeah so the superhero thing it's really there is a an npr

00:16:13.02 podcast named planet money and they tried this thing they wanted to see if

00:16:16.02 they could buy a superhero was essentially the idea and they couldn't

00:16:19.13 like they couldn't get why why did they want to buy a superhero uh it's just to

00:16:23.12 like representation of the thing because like there's so many superheroes

00:16:26.20 especially in the larger company's catalog and that you could essentially

00:16:30.09 lease it out if you wanted to just having in a world in which franchises

00:16:34.05 are important and superheroes are everywhere it couldn't be a bad thing to

00:16:38.02 have your own superhero and there are so many available the question was could

00:16:42.09 you acquire a superhero that nobody really knows about or cares about and it

00:16:46.18 wouldn't it just was impossible they were unable to largely because of groot

00:16:51.03 groot is like the example of a character

00:16:53.06 nobody gave a [ __ ] about that Disney now makes hundreds of millions of

00:16:57.00 merchandise with in the future so it's like it's just it's not worth whatever

00:17:02.00 you'd buy for it we are in sort of an interesting position of

00:17:06.04 roostert's tie to do we're in the inside already in a sense

00:17:10.12 so the idea I guess at that time was if we could then since we're already

00:17:15.09 on the inside could we get our own superhero well I I the idea of being uh

00:17:20.08 it was a response out of necessity because you thought

00:17:24.03 oh it's cool planet money is trying to to essentially buy a superhero to be

00:17:28.23 their new mascot or logo but what I'm seeing I'm seeing a troubling uh a

00:17:34.02 really troubling trend I've watched the boys I know where this goes I'm seeing

00:17:38.10 that plan of money is now going to have a leg up on every other brand because

00:17:44.08 they have a superhero to defend them sure

00:17:46.09 uh not physically of course right but we don't know that I feel like if

00:17:51.07 planet money and all these other entities are going to be out there

00:17:55.09 hiring and buying superheroes to be their own ambassadors

00:17:58.09 face needs a superhero to defend us and defend our brand against these other

00:18:03.07 brands I feel like it's a necessity at this point I completely agree and so I I

00:18:07.20 said at that time it was months ago that we should all look we should all try to

00:18:11.18 find the best do character we could find that

00:18:15.06 fits our idea it can't be a popular character we're not going to be able to

00:18:18.21 acquire batman we're not getting batman but what is like an obscure hard-to-find

00:18:24.04 character so that is a thing we all I think independently did or at least I

00:18:27.14 did we talked about it I feel like we should present our examples okay that's

00:18:31.23 great I know I'll say I went to I went to the powers that be and I said hey we

00:18:35.08 have this idea we want to do this they can we can you talk to Warner brothers

00:18:38.12 and see if they'll give us a superhero and they said who's the superhero and I

00:18:41.16 said well we haven't gotten that yet and they said this is a stupid idea and

00:18:44.19 they're probably gonna say no but at least come back to us with a with a

00:18:48.12 superhero so then we decided uh I sent out a link of lesser-known uh

00:18:51.19 superheroes and I thought we'd all go through and what was the plan to pick 10

00:18:55.04 each I think I think it was yeah like that seemed like a lot after I went

00:18:58.12 through the list I have three yeah I have three and there's really one I

00:19:02.02 believe in truly that I think is a perfect encapsulation of this show

00:19:06.15 it honestly makes me a little bit worried about your future Geoff in a

00:19:10.12 sense okay um okay I'm very excited about it I think there's a clear number

00:19:14.07 one but I have three okay I know how many you guys have well why don't you go

00:19:19.07 first okay I assume I'm the only one that did any research for this is my

00:19:25.01 you shouldn't assume that we have I thought we're gonna do this I

00:19:28.12 I like crammed I mentioned like four episodes ago I cram homework yeah so

00:19:32.00 this is this is my first one I don't think this

00:19:34.21 is these are some of them I just think are great I'm not saying we should

00:19:38.09 pursue this there's a an issue of a comic that is the guerrilla one is

00:19:43.01 strange sports stories the gorilla wonders of the diamond

00:19:47.09 look at how happy that [ __ ] monkey is sliding into the plate

00:19:50.19 it just brings joy to my heart stealing a base

00:19:54.23 I don't feel like they would be missing anything if we took the gorilla wonders

00:19:59.14 of the diamonds I don't think that's a big loss for do okay so gorilla wanders

00:20:03.13 the diamond his name is gorilla wonders of the diamond it's a whole team the

00:20:08.07 entire t it's an entire baseball we're buying a gorilla based baseball team

00:20:12.17 okay yeah it's all about these super smart gorillas that end up falling in

00:20:16.06 love with baseball for no real reason but they become obsessed with it and

00:20:18.10 then they enter a league and they just dominate they're the greatest baseball

00:20:22.00 team in that league well listen in a world where uh we learn to

00:20:26.06 skateboard from monkeys I think this makes total sense it does now the second

00:20:31.05 one and I just I personally this just makes me laugh and the character's name

00:20:36.12 is the printer's devil he is in two issues of detective comics

00:20:41.16 he's in 539 and 540. This is what he looks like uh essentially this character

00:20:46.21 he's a sports writer he's a sports columnist at the paper and

00:20:50.23 the paper is like oh we're gonna sell our company and he's like we can't have

00:20:55.06 that that could [ __ ] everything up so he buys a goat mask and a trident and he

00:21:00.21 starts causing mischief and he ends up cancelling out the sale

00:21:04.03 that's his whole thing he's just a guy with a goat mask and a trident oh and

00:21:09.05 he's trying to suspect the new owners no it's just it's tom it'd be like in

00:21:14.04 Scooby-doo they amassed him oh it's tom he covers sports he's our beat writer

00:21:17.18 for the local team his trident is a gun it's a trident dart gun thing like it's

00:21:23.05 not even real it's just like the corniest he's just he's a guy he's a guy that

00:21:27.10 went to a Halloween store about a goat mask and a cape he also got like hoof

00:21:31.15 boots he's a disgruntled employee who stopped at the spirit Halloween store so

00:21:36.06 this is we're on to to the number one this is

00:21:39.12 I'm so excited about this I've been sitting on this for a long time the

00:21:42.20 character's name the character's name is the smashing sportsman because we are a

00:21:47.14 baseball or a baseball show he's in two issues of the justice league 55-56 he is

00:21:53.09 so unknown this is literally the only image of him

00:21:57.11 I could find online and there's not much fanfare

00:22:01.01 that is all you can acquire now what's his name his name well okay so his

00:22:06.21 villain name is the smashing sportsman his character name is Marty Baxter so

00:22:11.07 let me just read the description of what the origin story of Marty Baxter is and

00:22:15.22 I took I bought the issue of the comic because I had to just verify some of the

00:22:20.13 things that they say and I also have some photos of those to back it Marty

00:22:24.05 baxter's world came crashing down when he learned that he had arthritis

00:22:29.14 with arthritis that is his great struggle the young baseball star now

00:22:35.11 found it in quotes impossible to swing a bat

00:22:38.19 and was absorbed in his problems as he sat in the stands watching the 1967

00:22:43.13 world series that he'd otherwise been playing in

00:22:46.22 so this is a baseball player who cannot swing a bat anymore due to arthritis

00:22:53.01 I love this now this is Geoff this is now

00:22:55.01 this is where I'm worried about you what I don't need to worry about is what

00:22:58.23 happens is he's watching the game and then this [ __ ] alien cube falls

00:23:02.22 out of the sky and hits him in the back okay struck in the back by a black

00:23:07.07 sphere Baxter leaped to his feet with a stunning discovery in quotes my

00:23:12.21 arthritis pain gone I feel like a new man bursting with power

00:23:16.02 his euphoria lasted only a moment before his resentment set in the metal railing

00:23:20.16 in front of Marty crumpled between his fingers as he lunged from the stands

00:23:25.16 I'll make the sports world pay for what they did to me I'm going to smash down

00:23:30.21 the stadium to the astonished baseball players he screamed down with all sports

00:23:36.23 so his whole thing is he is a baseball player who got arthritis

00:23:40.01 couldn't play anymore because of it gets hit by an alien cube in the back

00:23:44.17 and then he uh here we go I'm gonna send screen shots of the comic that I took

00:23:51.05 of uh you have this comic I bought it yes specifically to like

00:23:55.18 confirm that's him ripping the railing off and this is the black sphere this is

00:24:01.19 him screaming at very confused baseball players down with all sports as he's

00:24:07.22 ripping the railing off of the side of the thing so his whole deal

00:24:12.17 is he hates sport he the villain he's not targeting people his entire mission

00:24:16.17 is he's going city by city breaking stadiums so they can't play sports in

00:24:20.21 them that's this whole deal that's how they track them down they're like

00:24:23.20 where's the next stadium oh it's too high it's over time passed between that

00:24:27.14 thing twatting him in the back and him ripping

00:24:31.12 the railing off is it just a maybe maybe six seconds it is it's he immediately

00:24:36.21 he's really the laziest story ever

00:24:40.15 so if that was a movie the stadium would be

00:24:43.14 coming down and like the opening credits would still be like the names of the

00:24:48.06 people in the movie would still be on the screen did anybody ever claim

00:24:51.21 ownership over the black sphere no uh I don't know about that I don't

00:24:55.17 think so I think these were I don't think I think they were independent

00:24:59.03 alien beings that represented themselves as spheres and then when they hit you

00:25:04.02 they powered you up essentially was the idea

00:25:06.06 so he gets he is hit in the back and they're like oh [ __ ] this guy is

00:25:10.04 destroying stadiums left and right they cannot play sports because of this guy

00:25:15.11 so like robin and some other character figure out what stadium he's gonna be at

00:25:20.06 and they find him destroying the stadium and then he

00:25:22.17 he like just destroys them he like is super strong he can blow wind like he's

00:25:27.08 a ridiculous character and he beats them up and he's like ah maybe we ought to

00:25:30.18 have a trade and I should join the justice league like they do in the big

00:25:34.20 leagues like it's all weird like sports metaphors

00:25:38.06 and so the whole thing is he breaks stadiums now how they defeat him is

00:25:42.23 maybe even arguably more bizarre uh it turns out that the only weakness that

00:25:47.22 these alien black spheres have is really shitty jokes like really lame

00:25:53.22 dad joke type jokes and so they defeat the aliens by running to where they're

00:25:59.03 hanging out these guys and they start cracking bad jokes at Marty Baxter and

00:26:04.13 he starts laughing and the laughter causes the alien sphere to float out of

00:26:09.21 his body and then they zap it with a taser and it's gone

00:26:14.12 that's how they defeat the alien they also make a very clear point that they

00:26:19.01 are not going to arrest Marty Baxter because he was possessed by the alien

00:26:22.21 sphere he is not liable for the stadiums that he destroyed in between those two

00:26:27.20 events so was he he didn't he wasn't like down with all

00:26:31.12 sports once the ball left no as soon as the ball left he's just

00:26:35.20 like ah that was weird [ __ ] I broke like eight stadiums sorry about that

00:26:40.15 don't arrest me that scene in superman returns where he

00:26:44.15 stops the plane from like crashing into the baseball game and

00:26:48.17 Marty backstage like oh man I love the idea of Marty Baxter being at

00:26:55.11 that game and getting hit by the sphere and starts breaking it anyway

00:27:00.08 it stops the jet the stadium gets destroyed

00:27:03.09 so that is my 1a the smashing sportsman there's like no fanfare about him I

00:27:08.08 don't think anyone knows he exists like as I said that is the only image of that

00:27:13.12 guy could find I think that's a fantastic selection

00:27:17.10 Andrew uh and a great nomination I think he did a wonderful job

00:27:21.17 uh that is truly like I don't even know how you found that one

00:27:26.02 that is a that is a very minor minor character uh I have three as

00:27:29.12 well do you are you if you I'd rather do

00:27:31.08 mine I would love to hear I'm gonna post I'm gonna post them I'm gonna do the

00:27:34.19 same thing either I'm just gonna post them in the

00:27:38.06 uh yeah okay that's exactly right here's my three

00:27:42.02 I did this bit with your carts yeah now here's what here's what I uh

00:27:46.22 no no here's what I'm doing uh I I looked at this as a fantastic

00:27:50.10 opportunity to show uh the difference between our three cultures I don't think

00:27:54.23 we lean into enough the idea that you're

00:27:57.10 a Canadian and I'm an American and Gavin is British as far as we know uh and and

00:28:01.05 though we're all similar and we're all friends we all come from different

00:28:04.15 places different worlds we've had different experiences we uh ages

00:28:08.16 different ages where uh you know we're different cultures so I thought this was

00:28:12.23 a great opportunity to show the difference between our three cultures

00:28:17.09 because as soon as we had the idea I knew that as an um that you as a

00:28:20.15 Canadian were going to uh say you would do the job and then do the job and be

00:28:26.08 happy and excited about it and I knew that as a British person we assume Gavin

00:28:31.03 uh would take one look at it decide I'm not going to do about that and then

00:28:34.09 ignore it until the moment it's time to do it and then when we do the the the

00:28:38.21 podcast he would go what huh uh I don't know which I'm assuming uh he will be

00:28:43.00 filling in very soon with which I can't wait and then I as an American did the

00:28:46.18 American thing which is I copied off of your work and then I'm taking credit for

00:28:50.08 it I'm okay with this this is fine and that's the difference

00:28:53.08 between that's the difference between our three cultures and uh it's not that

00:28:56.21 I didn't want to do the work except I just I wanted to highlight that because

00:29:00.05 I thought it was a great opportunity to show how how similar but different we

00:29:04.12 all are Gavin do you have year three ready yeah just posted him um

00:29:08.23 you know I've been in america a long time I'm basically in america now

00:29:15.11 so let's have it as Gavin has posted mine which looks strikingly similar to

00:29:20.19 Andrews.

00:29:22.19 I think the smashing sport sportsman is perfect that's such a good one that's

00:29:28.00 the dumb that's so stupid I didn't realize like I knew there were some dumb

00:29:33.16 superheroes but that one is like was that written on like a napkin like what

00:29:38.15 was the did was it just meant to be a very temporary character yeah it was

00:29:42.23 very like clearly I mean he's not even it's like technically he's just a a

00:29:48.15 physical shell for the alien sphere like Marty Baxter is just a guy that has

00:29:52.09 arthritis is his character um never seen again after that no he has two

00:29:57.11 appearances and that's it and it's brief and like there's no well Eric posted a

00:30:02.12 picture of him getting punched in the face it's probably from the same comic oh

00:30:08.00 that's like the cover of the comic oh and who's punching him is that robin I'm

00:30:13.11 assuming robin dressed as batman well it's the big r on his chat robin

00:30:18.15 yeah oh no it looks like wonder woman fell in hit her head bumped her head

00:30:24.21 uh it seems to me like we need to begin a campaign now to convince do to uh sell

00:30:30.10 or give us uh the smashing sportsman he seems perfect he is perfect and he was

00:30:35.12 literally the first one I looked at I was I was trying to pull it out and I

00:30:38.16 accidentally came on that one and then I spent the next like five or six hours

00:30:42.20 reading every single one on the list um and none compared when did he come up

00:30:47.01 with his name the smashing sportsman was it after the first stadium or was it

00:30:52.01 like right after the railing I think it's a

00:30:55.19 I think it's immediate I don't know when

00:30:58.04 I don't think there's a time in which he

00:31:00.18 um I wonder if it was even him coming up with the name or if it was the alien

00:31:05.14 sphere coming up with the name it's another great question

00:31:09.22 where did he begin in the sphere end uh man I I'm [ __ ] jazzed I think that

00:31:14.21 face could do a lot worse than being officially protected by the smashing

00:31:19.14 sportsman he seems like the perfect uh he seems like the perfect brand defender

00:31:23.20 that's what makes me worried about it with you Geoff is he's a character with

00:31:27.16 arthritis who can no longer swing a bat because of it you have the arthritis

00:31:32.06 you're going to attempt to swing a bat I'm very nervous that we are one alien

00:31:35.17 sphere away from you becoming the smashing sportsman we'll put a net over

00:31:40.06 the top of it I go out every day and pray to get hit

00:31:43.15 in the back with a with a black alien sphere and it doesn't happen so

00:31:47.11 if if one day my prayers are answered look out world

00:31:51.09 it's just such a weird thing to turn against it'd be like if peter Parker got

00:31:56.13 bit by the spider and then he just decided to kill all bus drivers because

00:32:00.20 the bus drove up

00:32:03.03 because it's the first thing he saw

00:32:07.11 as a baseball podcast I think it fits perfectly with us well I would I would

00:32:12.02 love uh to hear what the comment leavers have to think about it absolutely I

00:32:15.12 don't think we're a baseball podcast anymore I think we're a fruit podcast

00:32:20.02 that I am okay with that as long as it's apple

00:32:22.15 not [ __ ] like banana apple the fruit not the product once again important

00:32:26.03 clarification yes sorry I was not paying attention

00:37:20.12 so what did you want to touch on Geoff you had you had a huge list apparently

00:37:24.21 oh yeah well the the uniform innovation yeah

00:37:28.02 we're down we're down to just that I think actually perfect and uh so when I

00:37:33.20 was in Florida last week uh as always my

00:37:36.07 body was in Florida on the other podcast but my mind and my heart and my brain

00:37:40.10 were back here uh with you guys uh trying to come up

00:37:43.13 with ideas for face and uh in that process I actually had a really good

00:37:47.21 conversation with minor league fan jack and then producer ben

00:37:51.19 uh who's honestly in a league of his own uh he really we should just call him

00:37:55.07 leave his own ben uh he's he's very he's he's really great uh it really stands

00:37:59.18 out next to minor league fan jack let me tell you after spending four days with

00:38:02.21 us too uh anyway and in that process they were actually super super helpful

00:38:07.10 they they uh I I don't know where their ideas begin and end and you know it was

00:38:10.21 just like a long conversation but I wanna I wanna give them huge props uh

00:38:14.13 because they were instrumental uh in the evolution of this idea I feel like

00:38:18.07 you're going against literally what you said america does

00:38:21.18 as the American move you should have just solely taken credit for it this is

00:38:25.10 your genius yeah I'm not maybe I'm not the best American I'm trying you know

00:38:29.13 okay that was a great opportunity to illustrate the the difference between

00:38:35.01 our cultures but I I just on a personal level I strive to to be better uh

00:38:39.17 so anyway uh the world was turned on its head the day that beef

00:38:43.20 bracelet came out I think we all can agree with that I think that nobody saw

00:38:50.00 it coming uh it smacked us all flipped our brains around changed the

00:38:54.22 way we think about things made everybody's life better and then uh we

00:38:58.15 thought we were good but we didn't rest there we immediately not immediately but

00:39:04.00 with the uh the appropriate amount of r d time uh

00:39:06.20 we hit him with our sophomore release too spicy icy right nobody saw it coming

00:39:11.19 totally different lane a lot of symmetry

00:39:13.22 between the products totally makes sense uniform uh which by the way uniform uh

00:39:18.14 providing uh or uh combining the power of one with the fabric of the farm

00:39:21.17 uniform uh can easily produce both products uh it makes total sense uh so

00:39:26.17 I've been thinking since then because that's like I'll be honest with you

00:39:29.20 people are chomping at the bit they're they're like knocking on my door like

00:39:33.01 Geoff we want what's the next too spicy I see we want the next thing I had

00:39:36.21 somebody in Florida uh at a at like a community meet up offer to help fund the

00:39:39.21 two spicy icee and I'm like I appreciate

00:39:42.08 that sir but that project is well on its way let's let's look to the future and

00:39:45.20 what the next thing is and in this process I found I I that I felt a

00:39:50.13 profound responsibility to create the next great thing and that's not a good

00:39:54.11 place to be when you want to create right desperation isn't the best should

00:39:58.04 be when you're trying to invent you don't want that pressure sometimes some

00:40:01.04 people thrive on under it but I I find it's best just to kind of let it work

00:40:04.08 itself out I was having that conversation with with jack and ben you

00:40:07.21 know talking about how frustrating it is and how uh I I just feel this

00:40:11.14 unrelenting pressure and I didn't think I'd be able to come up with anything for

00:40:16.21 a while then I read an article that changed my life did you guys know

00:40:20.17 this and by the way this is going to be phase one I'll go ahead and say this

00:40:24.04 right now this is phase this is phase one of this pro project okay did you

00:40:28.04 guys know that until 19

00:40:31.12 well I don't know the year until about 1914 until about 1914

00:40:35.18 in world war one people didn't wear wrist watches

00:40:39.20 yeah are you familiar with that yeah people had pocket watches wrist watches

00:40:45.17 were considered garish uh they were also considered feminine uh

00:40:49.08 some people that did wear them were women so it was considered like not

00:40:52.18 manly to wear one and this was uh this was in you know

00:40:55.18 they were very uh different times back then right uh that kind of thing

00:40:59.00 mattered to people more I guess and it wasn't until world war one that when

00:41:02.22 soldiers realized they didn't have time to be fishing around in their pockets

00:41:05.22 for their pocket watch to see what time it was they started wearing wrist

00:41:10.13 watches and it changed the world all because

00:41:12.14 all because some soldier didn't want to put his hand in his pocket because it

00:41:15.18 would have to he would have to take it off the trigger

00:41:19.14 that one moment even though even though this is 1914 to 1918 right even though

00:41:25.01 [ __ ] uh patek Philippe in 1868 a switch watch manufacturer Swiss watch

00:41:30.01 manufacturer invented the first rich wristwatch for countess koskowitz of

00:41:35.12 Hungary right so in 1868 the wristwatch is invented and brought out to the world

00:41:40.03 introduced to the world and it's not until 60 years later that it rises in

00:41:45.05 popularity fast forward to 2021 do you guys realize that the global

00:41:49.18 luxury watch market is estimated at 7.18 billion dollars and that by 2025

00:41:57.18 it's expected to reach 9.28 billion dollars think about that

00:42:02.19 that is nine billion dollars of wealth that will be generated in one year

00:42:07.16 75 years after the 100 years after the first dude decided I I should put this

00:42:14.10 stupid watch on my wrist so I don't have to keep fishing around in my pocket so

00:42:18.12 you're saying that's insane there's a clear there's a future for this like

00:42:23.07 it's going to continue what I'm saying what I'm saying is there is a tremendous

00:42:28.13 opportunity for us to look at what's in our pockets and put it on our wrist

00:42:35.03 think about it what a people I've been doing research I've been doing tons of

00:42:39.07 believe it or not there's a ton of research on what people carry in their

00:42:42.19 pockets here's a few of the most common things wallets pins keys candy snacks

00:42:47.16 we've covered that of course loose change dollars

00:42:52.01 phone comb mince and gum headphones lighter chap stick lipstick makeup knives

00:42:57.19 flashlights all we gotta do is put any one of those things on our

00:43:02.12 [ __ ] wrist and then popularize it and we will make nine billion dollars in

00:43:07.07 2025.

00:43:08.19 It's no sillier than what they did in world war one why

00:43:12.05 not a wrist comb why not wrist keys why not like key gloves why not like wolver

00:43:16.14 keys you hit a button and they extract out of your fingers I don't know but

00:43:20.17 what about Edward locksmith hands right there's all kinds of stuff we could do

00:43:24.18 I'm a big fan of the Swiss army wrist I think it should be this army

00:43:28.22 as like 20 different things and my girlfriend brought up to me she was like

00:43:32.08 the wrist wallets already exist wrist lets exist that kind of stuff

00:43:36.17 exists and I'm like yeah but the [ __ ]

00:43:39.09 wristwatch existed for 65 years before somebody realized oh this thing is

00:43:42.19 awesome it's dicks let's [ __ ] use it and now it's making billions of dollars

00:43:48.21 a year until please exist because swimming risk keys

00:43:51.15 but we need to popularize them it's not about that it's okay that they already

00:43:55.17 exist because they're not popular yet I've seen the wrist phone cases exist

00:44:00.12 too like little pip boys people could put but it takes the right group of

00:44:05.09 people to look at it see the need see the potential and then then [ __ ]

00:44:09.15 pounce on that potential and boom hit a thousand baseballs to the moon of

00:44:14.12 success and that's what I think we should do okay so phase one is we find

00:44:18.17 stuff that we can take from our pockets and put it on a wrist I already even

00:44:21.22 looked I put it in the face subreddit and then I took it out I didn't want you

00:44:25.11 guys to see it they are these are these are slap slap wrist like slap bands that

00:44:30.00 are also pins perfect they exist you didn't know that I didn't know that

00:44:34.00 because they're not popular yet plus we can make our own yeah like you know

00:44:37.14 writing pin a writing pin slap in writing paper you

00:44:40.09 meant like pins yeah like a pizza so you

00:44:42.12 don't need to carry a pin around anymore

00:44:44.06 you just slap in on your wrist yeah that hurts p-n-p-e-n

00:44:47.20 pins it's just one idea people from the south say it the same pin pen

00:44:52.18 I am from the software uh anyway so like wrist pins right

00:44:56.17 that's one thing we could do tomorrow there's so I what so what I'm presenting

00:45:01.23 to you guys isn't necessarily a product it's an idea for a suite of products

00:45:06.21 it's if anything it's an idea for a revolution I mean am I writing with my

00:45:11.05 wrist or am I just pulling a pen out of it you pull it off and then you can

00:45:14.12 write with it and you slap it back down or who knows because we can invent

00:45:18.11 things too I'm just saying that exists we can buy it we can put our logo on it

00:45:21.12 we can change it around we can we can improve upon it right they had to

00:45:24.23 improve upon the wristwatch by the way it used to have to have in those days it

00:45:28.02 used to have to have a guard around the top of it because they had to protect uh

00:45:31.11 the crystal and they were scared that it would break and glass was very hard to

00:45:34.12 come by so they had these like metal things that covered and they just had

00:45:37.20 holes where you could see the hours uh but and then we uh we improved upon that

00:45:42.08 now you have a fully faced glass wristwatch we can improve upon these

00:45:46.15 things that already exist as we popularize them and help usher

00:45:50.05 wrist entertainment risked convenience into the 21st century we need to drag it

00:45:55.03 into the 21st century like they drug watches into the 20th century I would

00:46:00.04 have never guessed that the handshake came out after the wristwatch [Laughter]

00:46:04.15 that's one of my takeaways from this I I

00:46:06.16 think I like where your head is at do we

00:46:08.14 have to like rank what is most important to us as far as no I think we just I I

00:46:12.22 think we just think about what would do well

00:46:15.03 and uh like I said I'm not presenting you necessarily a the pen the slap band

00:46:20.04 pen is an idea that I had and I looked and it exists and and we can work on

00:46:23.12 that but I I would more just present to you the idea that start thinking in this

00:46:28.07 direction what how could face revolutionize people's wrists we already

00:46:32.14 did it once with wrist with beef bracelet obviously everybody knows that

00:46:36.12 but with the help of uniform uniform combining the power of one with the

00:46:39.18 fabric of the farm uniform we can there's almost nothing we can't do

00:46:43.22 you know what I mean do we still need to have a wrist bracelet if we're doing

00:46:47.07 this we could we could do whatever you want okay I'm just curious if this is

00:46:50.22 replacing if this is like an innovation on the beef bracelet or if they could we

00:46:54.13 could we could we could further innovate the beef bracelet we could make it a

00:46:58.00 part of this it could maintain its own thing uh maintain its own identity I'm

00:47:03.12 open to all possibilities because I'm just I'm seeing I'm just seeing untapped

00:47:09.05 potential and I don't think anyone is better positioned than face

00:47:14.15 to jump to pounce on that potential and we will all be billionaires this time by

00:47:20.07 2025 if we do it properly and then after we spend a couple maybe I don't

00:47:24.09 know how long how much time it's gonna take for us to go through phase one but

00:47:29.20 uh then then my friends then we enter into phase two

00:47:32.13 are you ready for phase two are you excited about phase two do you think you

00:47:36.08 can handle phase two I'm ready for it I hope I can okay what have we what have

00:47:40.05 we been doing what have we been doing all through phase one which is a useful

00:47:43.13 phase it's gonna be a financially beneficial phase for us it's gonna we're

00:47:47.06 all gonna be very happy that we went through it

00:47:49.12 what are we gonna do when we get to phase two I'll tell you what we're gonna

00:47:53.11 do we're gonna eliminate damn near everything we did in phase one because

00:47:58.12 we're going to eliminate the very pocket itself we don't need it it's [ __ ] I

00:48:02.22 I've been uh I've lived with women most of my life they hate their pockets

00:48:06.16 because they're tiny and useless and often times sewed together it's not fair

00:48:10.17 that men have big pockets and women have small pockets and also

00:48:14.00 the [ __ ] I I will go so far as to say I've been thinking about this a lot the

00:48:17.07 back pocket is a goddamn atrocity we need to get rid of it because that thing

00:48:21.16 is a menace think about this men what do

00:48:24.02 you put in your back pocket you put your wallet in your back pocket what's in

00:48:28.00 your wallet everything you own that you can't possibly leave home without and

00:48:32.22 where do you put it on the one spot of your body that you don't have eyes on

00:48:36.21 you got no coverage on you can't see back there that's the dumbest thing ever

00:48:40.11 it's like here's everything that's important and valuable to me I'm gonna

00:48:43.14 stick it on my ass and show everybody but me I hate it we need to get rid of

00:48:48.19 pockets and by doing that what we will do is we will migrate the very pocket to

00:48:53.07 the wrist think of a big floppy pocket just hang it from your wrist

00:48:57.02 throw your keys in there you can see your keys throw your wallet in there you

00:49:00.05 got eyes on it at all times it's in front of you it's a lot harder to pick a

00:49:03.23 hand than it is to pick a butt you've invented the purse without a strap I

00:49:08.08 have invented the wrist pocket the purse exists the wrist let exists all of these

00:49:12.23 things exist don't eliminate the word invent from your from

00:49:16.21 your brain right now we're not talking about it I'm imagining like

00:49:22.03 we're talking about revolutionizing we're talking about popularizing

00:49:26.21 we're talking about we're talking about taking things that may exist already but

00:49:31.23 making them better and more prevalent so that the

00:49:35.01 the larger world sees them through the eyes through the lens with the

00:49:39.18 possibility that we do so that they to the we then uh incent them to want these

00:49:44.02 products to improve their lives and then it's not a product at that point we're

00:49:47.14 it's a whole goddamn movement we're changing the world we're gonna get rid

00:49:51.12 of pockets in phase two phase one we're gonna

00:49:54.16 improve risks phase two we're getting rid of pockets and phase three we're all

00:49:59.01 buying boats and [ __ ] high-fiving off super yachts I love it I'm a big fan of

00:50:03.12 this I I will have I kind of have an idea in my mind already I think I'll

00:50:07.20 have a prototype next time we record I'm about to name an idea I like a horse

00:50:13.11 feed bag for my hand yeah maybe if that's what it could look

00:50:17.20 like yeah I am all about the convenience and hands-free of things like it's it's

00:50:21.20 a big one of my great struggle maybe we the uniform could maybe branch onto this

00:50:27.18 I really wish that goggles were a popularized form of glasses I cannot

00:50:32.06 stand I should have the worst long distance vision I have glasses never

00:50:36.10 wear them don't like the feel of it on my nose they're always sliding down

00:50:40.00 always uncomfortable I wish I could live

00:50:42.12 in a world where I could just strap some goggles on and I'm good to go if

00:50:47.09 goggles were popular my vision would be substantially better a day-to-day life

00:50:51.04 your nose indestructible but can't hold up a pair of glasses it cannot it's too

00:50:55.10 I'm telling you it's too slippery it bobs and weaves it's not even glasses

00:50:59.12 can stand just put some grip on the glasses like grip tape oh yeah then he

00:51:03.23 did he looks like a 1950s shop teacher no like putting on goggles like what are

00:51:08.12 you also you know what you know what Andrew it's 2021 we are living in the

00:51:12.10 [ __ ] future what's more futuristic than goggles I'm not even talking like

00:51:16.08 cool futuristic like whenever you see a basketball player with goggles like I'm

00:51:20.11 always like I wish that was a look that was just acceptable I wish that was a

00:51:24.06 popularized form of it or even like the pool like

00:51:27.00 when you put pool goggles on I wish those for glasses existed I wish that

00:51:31.00 was just the thing I don't think they're

00:51:32.18 always sliding so I don't wear them yeah

00:51:34.21 but you can't bad peripheral vision with there's a reason it's just right in

00:51:38.08 front on glasses I will I will take a hit on

00:51:41.07 my peripheral vision in exchange for them not sliding and not having to ever

00:51:46.20 think about them they're just locked in you but also it but once again

00:51:51.20 goggles exist but goggles with perfect peripheral vision might not exist but

00:51:55.22 they could maybe that's been holding everyone back and maybe if we can solve

00:51:59.15 that problem then not only can Andrew enjoy these goggles but everybody can

00:52:03.10 maybe every kid in high school will be wearing face goggles this time 2025 I

00:52:08.01 don't know but I love it I love the way it's going and from what I can tell from

00:52:12.10 the from eric's uh comments in the discord he's on board as well I think

00:52:17.02 the most useful place for a magnetic implant would be around the eyes so you

00:52:22.07 could just magnet glasses onto the front of your face

00:52:25.13 I love that idea I like the idea I don't

00:52:27.22 want them to put anything near my eyes I don't want any like a just it's scary

00:52:32.06 it's a scary place just under the eyebrows nah no I don't want any

00:52:36.02 machinery going in there I don't want I don't trust machinery just like a thin

00:52:39.13 magnet yeah but they're gonna have to do a surgical procedure

00:52:56.06 he got scared of the magnets.

00:53:00.17 I was talking and my mouth just suddenly went very dry I'm good

00:53:05.22 so there you go guys uh I don't have a new product for us but I have a vision

00:53:11.04 of where I feel like you just said like seven different products I think we were

00:53:14.12 plenty of products yeah but I mean I don't have like I don't know I gave I

00:53:17.10 gave jumping off points right but I don't have materials prepared for you

00:53:21.00 guys I don't have logos and commercials and not like I usually come you know

00:53:24.21 like with a product ready for sure I just have more of an idea of where we

00:53:29.11 could take this I feel like the last place I want more clutter is around my

00:53:35.01 hands area yeah that's what people said before world war one [Laughter]

00:53:40.08 I'm excited I I have a prototype in mind I don't know if you have any ideas

00:53:44.00 gathered but I immediately just have a thought I could certainly come up with

00:53:48.13 something for the next episode I would love to have my phone permanently on the

00:53:52.23 side of my wrist kind of like where quarterbacks put their plays you know

00:53:57.13 when they like pop it up and they look at their plays before they should they

00:54:00.12 shut the thing uh I would love to have my phone there and I could just like

00:54:04.21 it would be so cool I yeah I like I like where your head is

00:54:08.13 at I honestly this is more grounded than I was anticipating I could see a world

00:54:13.01 where this exists I spent a lot of time in a hotel room on

00:54:16.19 my back with nothing to do but browse the internet for fake products so

00:54:22.13 I think it'll be interesting to see what we value for our pockets

00:54:26.12 what things do we want brought to the front I guess that's all of it right is

00:54:30.01 what you're saying because phase two is the destruction of pockets so really we

00:54:34.17 can't have anything in there well not to destroy them but to to render them uh

00:54:38.20 useless to the degree that uh you can use that pocket if you need to but

00:54:41.20 everybody else is going to be using wrist pockets at this point so you'll be

00:54:46.12 you'll be you won't be in vogue anymore you know wrist pockets have you ever

00:54:50.15 been outside sweating in the heat and you have to then go somewhere that

00:54:54.21 requires a mask and you realize your mask has been in your back pocket and

00:54:59.16 you've been sat sweating on it for the last two hours

00:55:02.14 no because I usually hang my mask around my wrist ah you're already you're

00:55:06.21 already putting yourself I already risked my mask without and I didn't even

00:55:10.08 think about it till this until you said that but that's exactly how I I'm

00:55:13.17 already doing this in practice holy [ __ ]

00:55:16.09 are you really wristing your masks already I always risk my mess I've been

00:55:21.11 doing it for you since day one I can't okay you're

00:55:23.22 Geoff is a wrist guy is what I've learned yeah I I hate the feeling of that I

00:55:27.14 can't get get [ __ ] off my arms yeah I don't know man I I started

00:55:32.08 wearing watches and it really it's really and then it's really opened up my

00:55:36.14 love of wrist stuff and I think that there's a lot of I think a lot of people

00:55:40.01 feel the same well I feel like let's let's just explore because I agree with

00:55:43.22 you I I have no issue with the wrist where would you like it to be Gavin like

00:55:48.08 what is is there a different part of the body that would be more ideal than the

00:55:51.18 wrist to hold a mask to hold whatever it just seemed like you didn't like things

00:55:55.17 around your wrist generally speaking as how I interpreted that comment

00:56:00.12 where would where would the ideal place be if not the wrist maybe my back

00:56:04.16 you just are we just making a backpack at this point like what type of imagine

00:56:09.14 imagine a backpack except it's in the shirt it's like a big a big old pocket a

00:56:15.12 big pocket on the back of a t-shirt that I could just like

00:56:18.03 stick an iPad in or something yeah I like this I feel like that's very

00:56:21.19 specific because what you're gonna sit down you're gonna that's gonna stab you

00:56:25.01 immediately whatever you got back there it'd be kind of like how snake eyes in

00:56:28.21 storm shadow have their swords crossed on the back but instead it's like a

00:56:32.22 laptop and an iPad or like a pocket that could fit a water bottle in it or

00:56:36.11 something just something where it's like I don't want to

00:56:39.02 I don't take the bag with me but if I just have my water bottle and I just

00:56:42.11 sort of slot it into my back like a sword like I'm shiving a sword behind my

00:56:47.22 back I pull it out when I get to work class

00:56:50.14 I mean I I think I think this is this is exactly where we need to be thinking

00:56:54.22 thinking like this like take a step back and think of it this

00:56:57.11 way why are pockets where they are because the first person who put a

00:57:00.19 pocket put it there and then we all went oh okay I guess that's where pockets go

00:57:04.02 and then you put a pocket there because the last guy put a pocket there and the

00:57:07.12 person before that put a pocket there and so for hundreds of years we've all

00:57:10.17 had pockets where they are because we're just we're just [ __ ] sheep we're just

00:57:14.10 sheeping our way through pocket town right no I feel like people have

00:57:17.14 adventured with the pocket there's there's sleeve pockets there's chest

00:57:20.17 pockets I feel like people don't use them that people don't use them because

00:57:23.18 they haven't cracked the code yet people

00:57:25.22 didn't use wristwatches till we did till the the need and the benefit was shown

00:57:30.23 to them and then they became a symbol of

00:57:32.18 masculinity that they became a symbol of patriotism and then everybody wanted to

00:57:36.23 wear them that's all we need to do we need to find our world war one pocket

00:57:40.16 watch that's all we gotta do I really like the idea of more pockets I know

00:57:44.20 we're supposed to get rid of them but if

00:57:46.21 somebody had like a clown's car worth of items and hidden pockets that's just a

00:57:51.02 great that's hilarious I guess I don't I guess I don't want to eliminate the

00:57:55.11 pocket I just want to eliminate it's it's it

00:57:58.03 it's uh intransigence in where it lives I want to I want to liberate the pocket

00:58:02.08 you know what I mean I want the pocket to I want the pocket to move to move for

00:58:06.07 you I don't want I don't want you to put

00:58:08.11 your [ __ ] in a pocket that is put there because of hundreds of years of people

00:58:13.10 following in line and not thinking outside the box not looking up just

00:58:17.05 looking at their feet and shuffling forward through fashion not not not even

00:58:21.18 daring to look left or right and innovate I want us to innovate I want

00:58:24.19 the pocket to go where you want the pocket to go it's like I said a long

00:58:27.21 time ago you're talking about the mindset of like always punting on fourth

00:58:31.10 down people do it because that's what people do not because it necessarily

00:58:35.09 exactly what you want because it makes sense

00:58:38.18 yeah we need a culture change of not always going for the pocket yeah and and

00:58:43.14 that's that's where bold people make bold decisions and find bold successes

00:58:49.11 is the product called bold like I I felt very nice I'm just saying like what I'm

00:58:54.11 just no I don't know I'm just saying like that's how I think this is this

00:58:59.12 could be a huge untapped potential future for face a a division of fluke

00:59:03.13 face uh division of uh of uniform uniform uh combining the power of one

00:59:07.17 with the fabric of the farm uniform you know what I'm saying so

00:59:12.08 I just I I think we would be remiss uh I think it would be it'd be a tremendous

00:59:18.08 wasted opportunity also to cement face in the social

00:59:21.01 uh the permanent social fabric of the world well we're already gonna reinvent

00:59:25.00 the high five right what better way to follow it up than to reinvent the pocket

00:59:30.19 and the wrist it's the very wrist itself I like it I'm gonna have a prototype

00:59:34.19 or at least I'll try to next time we record I have an idea I'll have one too

00:59:38.10 but we might not get to it because of all the chocolate andrew's gonna eat.

00:59:43.03 [Laughter]

00:59:44.05 That's gonna be easy I'm gonna be on my

00:59:47.20 victory lap well I guess uh [ __ ] when is what what day is next Wednesday 27th

00:59:52.12 or no I guess Thursday we'll record next week we'll record Thursday yeah yeah

00:59:57.12 normally so that'll be one day before I go before

01:00:00.15 so the chocolate good lead and also banana it's a lot of food stuff like that

01:00:06.08 there's a lot of food stuff lined up that I we didn't see coming an hour and

01:00:11.20 a half ago absolutely not we're a food podcast

01:00:14.17 are you okay with us being a food podcast Eric as opposed to baseball I

01:00:18.07 feel like you kind of didn't like the idea of us being a baseball podcast I it

01:00:22.00 didn't feel like we ever embraced fully the baseball podcast because Geoff

01:00:25.16 wouldn't throw the ball so now I feel like I feel like you're embracing the

01:00:30.06 food embracing nuggets embracing chocolate being anti-banana but pro

01:00:34.16 apple weirdly I I mean I I'm fine with being I only produce food podcasts at

01:00:38.20 this point so yeah that's fine okay hey Eric make sure can I ask you a question

01:00:42.00 while you're here yeah yeah what's up what's in your uh do you have anything

01:00:45.03 in your pockets right now uh no I just put on shorts and I don't have anything

01:00:48.19 in my pockets while I'm sitting at my desk hmm if you were gonna leave the

01:00:51.22 house what do you think you would throw in your pockets to leave uh I would grab

01:00:57.14 my keys my phone my wallet my mask uh uh maybe a chap stick and put it in the

01:01:04.08 little chap stick part of my you know like there's like a little tiny yeah

01:01:09.23 yeah iPod nano goes yeah that's where the iPod nano goes but until I charge

01:01:14.21 that and get it working from 2007 I will just put a chap stick there instead um

01:01:20.17 those are kind of all of my go-to's I suppose for um

01:01:25.05 what what I would need for my pockets okay that's very helpful thank you I uh

01:01:29.18 yeah I I I can see I can see a world where all of those things live on a

01:01:34.10 wrist easily I mean I'm all for what you're talking about

01:01:38.19 here with the wrist pack and everything I know a lot of

01:01:42.10 professional wrestlers who wear I unironically wear fanny packs everywhere

01:01:47.14 all the time constantly and swear by them swear up and dead just like I

01:01:51.21 didn't think they would be that helpful and I'd never leave without my fanny

01:01:54.20 pack they don't have anything in their pockets everything is in the fanny pack

01:01:59.05 I've never tried one so this is doable not I'm not a fan of the fanny pack but

01:02:03.10 I am a fan of the idea of like I realize there's some there's some adjacency to

01:02:07.14 what we're doing here so and that's and that's why I believe in uniform

01:02:12.19 thank you for believing in uniform uniform combining the power of one with

01:02:16.17 the fabric of the form uniform uh okay well that's great I uh I I I I

01:02:21.11 think there's a lot of I think keys alone there's a lot of opportunity I

01:02:25.05 can't wait for the magnet approach of this and it being too powerful and your

01:02:29.13 wrist is getting stuck together that is what I'm very excited.

01:02:36.12 I'm just making notes of what prototype I want to make and I just found an old I

01:02:40.06 found a picture I think I showed this to Geoff Andrew what do you think is

01:02:45.09 happening in this picture oh I'm excited oh Jesus Christ okay

01:02:53.20 it's it's like the worst spike Jones video for like Michelle Audrey um

01:02:59.11 we're in somebody's mouth is that Geoff I think this is Geoff I would have

01:03:06.21 assumed Geoff's mouth no but it looks like I'm in the photo it does

01:03:14.02 but it's so curved right now I just assumed it's not the back the people in

01:03:19.00 the background Geoff is not what you immediately notice someone looking at

01:03:23.14 this photo this Andrew is a uh a nice this might be the only one in

01:03:29.08 existence a nice picture of Geoff and myself

01:03:33.07 taken from inside my league fan jack's mouth oh it's horrendous

01:03:38.02 we'll have to we'll have to ask him if he's like

01:03:42.06 but I don't think I've ever seen a picture of people from inside someone's

01:03:48.06 mouth before yeah it's like it's like tongue pov it's like yeah

01:03:52.17 on jack's tongue what he's talking about this could be the new Instagram craze

01:03:58.02 inside the mouth portraits I love I would love to see more of these it was

01:04:03.01 basically we're in Australia having lunch I think

01:04:06.10 and I had my 360 camera out and jack just walked up he arrived late because we

01:04:11.19 we left without him so we had to get a separate uber and

01:04:15.15 then he just walked up while I had that and he just put my camera in his mouth

01:04:19.12 for like one second but because it's 360

01:04:21.18 I then like went into the file and it was originally pointed at the back of

01:04:26.13 his throat but I just spun it around and you can see out of his mouth

01:04:31.00 it's so disgusting it looks so wet in there it looks like that like uh Cortana

01:04:36.03 level in halo it looks dirty how many how many bites does it take for

01:04:41.07 that mouth to eat a nugget we need to do measurements I think it's

01:04:45.06 more like how many nuggets can that bite eat in one could that mouth eaten one

01:04:49.01 bite it looks not safe for work no it looks

01:04:52.19 like alien there's like a very alien vibe to this

01:04:56.13 you never see behind someone's teeth and lips no very rarely

01:05:00.15 outside of video games like I feel like that's always the classic like oh I've

01:05:05.17 morphed into a character let me like see through their face

01:05:10.15 there's a picture of two-thirds of this podcast from inside jack's mouth

01:05:15.03 I don't think you could identify somebody from the inside of their mouth

01:05:18.19 I don't like without contact do you think a dentist could I bet a dentist

01:05:22.09 could I think a dentist probably could but I don't want to know that about

01:05:25.14 somebody I don't want to ever be at a level with someone be like oh imagine if

01:05:29.08 I [ __ ] knew that was jack's mouth that what a crazy full that would have

01:05:32.08 been imagine if I would be like yeah it looks like jack's mouth I'd recognize

01:05:36.11 that fourth tooth from the left anywhere [Laughter]

01:05:39.18 eric's not a sign of the lips there's something about seeing the teeth

01:05:44.10 and like the top of like the roof of the mouth that's like oh that's gross for

01:05:49.11 some reason seeing the lips over the teeth but they're the inside of

01:05:55.11 the lips is so like it really I put in the chat this it

01:05:59.09 looks like a cronenberg film it looks like long live the new flesh

01:06:03.08 like disgusting the fly level [ __ I I don't like this like I keep looking at

01:06:07.19 it because I can't look away I want to see a zombie movie entirely from this

01:06:13.03 perspective I'm just like one zombie just like the worst be terrible

01:06:17.22 uh I think that's a that's a great comp er Eric it definitely feels very like

01:06:22.10 video drone-esque ugh I think maybe if we ever all forever all

01:06:26.14 together at rtx we should take and we do a panel we should take a picture of the

01:06:31.20 entire cast of space from inside jack's mouth

01:06:33.20 oh that's a great idea that's a great I'm okay with that that's why what were

01:06:37.10 you thinking well I was just gonna I don't think we need more mouths out

01:06:40.09 there like if anything I feel like this photo should be deleted it's it's

01:06:43.21 disturbing I don't want this to be a trend just like the idea of jack's mouth

01:06:48.14 being a camera [Laughter]

01:06:50.08 the weirdest angle for the Truman show that's the most camera guy

01:06:55.22 maybe that's the next direction we'll move into is taking stuff out of our

01:07:00.19 pockets moving into our wrist then eliminating the wrist all together and

01:07:04.14 creating mouth mouth products I thought you're gonna say move everything from

01:07:09.14 the pockets to the mouth and I was like no we should not do that

01:07:13.20 just stole my keys jack's back

01:07:25.07 oh the smashing sportsman I love it he's that guy he's a guy

01:07:31.12 I can't think of another superhero who more uh deftly uh

01:07:36.04 uh exemplifies the face brand than the smashing than the uh

01:07:42.13 the uh arthritis-ridden smashing sportsman

01:07:47.12 it's perfect he fits us and nobody gives a [ __ ] about him it's fantastic like

01:07:52.15 nobody I love it I'm excited for the world to learn about the smashing sports

01:07:57.20 what do you think he's worth I don't know I think if we

01:08:02.01 if we showed that photo of jack's mouth they would just give it away like if we

01:08:07.09 used it as a threat it's a terrifying image

01:08:11.12 and I gotta say one thing I liked about this episode really light on the fruit

01:08:16.00 talk very light on the fruit we could even I know we're talking about this

01:08:19.11 before smashing sportsman bats potentially that could be a bad thing in

01:08:23.12 the future the bats we sell bats a lot of opportunities

01:08:27.15 there's a lot of opportunities there that's like two pretty good episodes

01:08:32.10 there yeah two really good I'm excited for next week

01:08:34.20 yeah I can't wait I'm so excited for next week I didn't I was afraid we

01:08:37.20 wouldn't be able to cram all this into two episodes and not only did we we

01:08:41.13 crammed like banana content we crammed chocolate con there was a lot of

01:08:45.14 directions we went but I didn't even expect we talked about dusty baker for

01:08:50.20 like 16 minutes which is not what I anticipated worth it yeah but

01:08:54.10 but what a mind [ __ ] to find out that the high five

01:08:57.18 the high [ __ ] five was invented in 1977. Well out of shite I don't believe

01:09:03.05 it for a second oh a lot of bollocks

01:09:10.08 well Gavin I can tell you as someone who

01:09:13.17 lived in the before times it was dark we didn't we didn't know how to there's a

01:09:17.21 lot of patent on the back it didn't feel quite right uh things were a little bit

01:09:21.07 more homophobic back then so we didn't pat each other on the butt it was we

01:09:24.16 didn't celebrate properly we just didn't and uh I remember that I remember the

01:09:28.04 great day uh when everything changed and and uh I

01:09:32.03 can see how I I'm only living in a world full of high fives

01:09:36.06 it would be hard for you to comprehend uh a world without but it

01:09:40.03 I was there it was dark and yeah you should you should hope that

01:09:43.06 we never get plunged back into that darkness again

01:09:47.01 thank you for listening to another episode of face I believe this was the

01:09:53.07 75th iteration of this podcast and probably the 65th to mention some sort

01:09:58.21 of a food related challenge if you liked it tell somebody about it

01:10:02.08 because that's how we survive and if you don't tell somebody about it one of us

01:10:07.06 will die thanks for listening [Music]

01:10:21.09 you
