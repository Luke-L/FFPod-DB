00:00:36.06 Why did you post that why did I put because I was I was talking about

00:00:40.17 partially as immotep a bad guy to nick and then Geoff joined in

00:00:45.05 and they brought up some points that I feel like are probably fair and I'm not

00:00:49.12 saying that he isn't a bad guy I just don't remember what his plans were beyond

00:00:53.20 saving his girlfriend nick said that he killed a lot of people

00:00:57.10 and I was like he killed six people that's really not that many in the great

00:01:01.00 screen scheme of like evil movie villains he you know what's that hello

00:01:04.17 you know what though I'd love to do a lot a lot of property damage with those

00:01:09.11 storms those sandstorms millions of dollars of property damage

00:01:13.12 you cannot do like you can't make that point while the marvel movies exist in

00:01:18.23 the event like that there's different universes six people is

00:01:24.10 tremendously bad still there's not a lot worse than killing six people

00:01:29.18 now what about the people that were displaced he may have displaced ten

00:01:34.12 thousand people from their homes how many people are going to die over of

00:01:37.18 disease and malnutrition over the course of the next decade because their

00:01:42.15 livelihoods got destroyed because of his nonsense you have to

00:01:46.05 think about the after effects terminator he comes up and he'll kill 7080 people

00:01:50.19 and then he's out a guy like imotep comes up he may kill six people today

00:01:54.23 but he might kill a hundred thousand people over the course of the next

00:01:58.10 [ __ ] 10 years he was also trying to raise an army of

00:02:02.11 dogs at one point which I'm sure killed quite a lot of people

00:02:05.09 he was just a big dog guy he knew where the internet was headed he wanted to get

00:02:09.10 ahead of the curve he wanted the docs tell Geoff what you said about your

00:02:13.22 motive earlier what did I say about ammo tap earlier

00:02:17.01 he said oh it's the john immotep is the john wick of Egypt

00:02:21.08 like he was just minding his own business he was dead

00:02:25.17 and then some people came in and woke him up stole his [ __ ] and then he

00:02:30.05 specifically kills those people to get his body back john wick wasn't trying to

00:02:34.10 resurrect corpses no but john wick was a guy who was living his life and then

00:02:39.12 some [ __ ] idiots came in and killed his dog and brought him back into the

00:02:43.22 game here's the difference he went and wanted

00:02:47.04 to get revenge he didn't it like and he could have

00:02:50.06 he could have tried to resurrect that dog from the dead but he chose not to he

00:02:55.09 chose not to go down the supernatural evil route and instead he enacted

00:02:58.20 completely believable revenge I understand it's not one to one but my

00:03:02.16 point is that these were both people that were just living their lives and

00:03:08.00 then were thrust into the story of what happened by others I feel like most

00:03:12.12 most movies start with something happening to a

00:03:17.01 but there's character I'm not you're taking such the wrong point from this

00:03:21.15 not every movie starts with somebody doing something to that character

00:03:26.00 there are movies where people are like I'm gonna [ __ ] solve this I'm gonna

00:03:30.05 do this like there's a point I actually I actually have one that I think is in

00:03:33.19 similar vein to what you're saying that has always stuck out to me okay did you

00:03:39.16 guys ever watch the tv show uh the walking dead yes

00:03:43.22 do you remember the whole negan I do but he was like the big bad evil guy he

00:03:49.22 had the baseball bat uh named I don't know Nadine or Geraldine or

00:03:54.02 something Francine the community it was Francine yes it was the comedian it was

00:03:58.02 negan Geoffrey d Geoffrey dean Morgan yeah the comedian from watchmen anyway he's

00:04:01.21 like the bad guy wears a leather jacket [ __ ] kills people left and right

00:04:05.12 he was on Howard stern once and Howard was asking him like how do you prepare

00:04:09.16 for a role of being such an evil bad guy and he looked at Howard and he was like

00:04:13.13 I uh I don't think I'm a bad guy and howard's like what he goes I'm serious I

00:04:17.10 I am living a life with my people trying

00:04:19.13 to keep my people alive and this goddamn

00:04:21.13 rick and his buddies keep showing up and stealing our stuff and killing people

00:04:25.06 and raiding us so we're just defending ourselves and then you know I don't want

00:04:28.12 to be pushed around so if somebody's gonna come and [ __ ] with me I'm gonna

00:04:32.00 [ __ ] with them twice as hard I'm the protagonist of my story they're the bad

00:04:35.14 guys and I that really made me sit and think for a while I feel like every

00:04:39.17 actor who plays the villain says that I feel like that's universal of like I'm

00:04:43.18 playing actually to play this villainous character I need to somehow convince

00:04:48.19 myself that they are the hero of the story yeah you know who is the other if

00:04:52.19 if Geoffrey dean Morgan turned down negan do you know who's gonna get it it was

00:04:56.12 second no he had the job for 20 minutes apparently and then Geoffrey dean Morgan

00:05:00.23 was like no I want to do it so he got it Matthew lillard would have been oh

00:05:05.20 I'm not even there he would have played it like a 90s

00:05:09.07 psycho he did like three auditions for it I think and they're like yeah if he

00:05:13.05 would have said no you would have been negan and I I I can't imagine what that

00:05:17.02 would have looked like but I would like to see it it's just so odd I wouldn't

00:05:21.14 the last time I saw Matthew lillard the last time I saw Matthew lillard would

00:05:24.18 have been around the same time period would stood that twin peaks reboot or

00:05:28.19 not reboot sorry but the new twin peaks season and uh I can't imagine that guy

00:05:34.23 in twin beaks being scary or intimidating or I mean he was the bad guy

00:05:39.16 in scream yeah he was yeah sort of yeah one of yeah so it's not like out of

00:05:44.23 character to play a you know psychopath but he like the the vibe is so different

00:05:50.04 negan to who he played and scream and like who he typically play like he just

00:05:55.02 sort of plays like an idiot in scream that is just you never really get into

00:05:59.20 his motivations for it he's just kind of a guy where negan

00:06:03.01 is intimidating physically in a different way yeah Matthew lillard is

00:06:07.01 net except for maybe twin peaks he's not well even then he's never not silly you

00:06:11.13 know what I mean it's hard to take him seriously I'm

00:06:14.15 trying to he's got that he's got that like natural humor about him the

00:06:18.11 descendants that's the only role I can think of

00:06:22.11 where he's not he's just a guy that is cheating with George clooney's wife

00:06:27.11 we're a Matthew littlet podcast is this oh my god what episode is this 83 oh

00:06:32.15 so interesting this is 82 according to nick do you guys know the significance

00:06:38.17 of episode 82 I just I just realized it yesterday no uh

00:06:42.13 no episode 82 we missed we missed a bit of a milestone episode 82 is I believe

00:06:48.23 the second episode of season three of face

00:06:54.02 we we had a season shift no we don't no that's not no no yeah it is how it works

00:06:59.11 season one ended at episode 40 season two began at episode 41 which would mean

00:07:04.15 that season two ended at episode 80 and season two began at 81. I'm gonna

00:07:09.13 challenge this no I feel like this season extends to the end of the

00:07:13.06 redemption yeah I feel like this season I feel like at the time the conversation

00:07:17.17 was really well if we're gonna if we're gonna wait for full redemption

00:07:21.02 season two's gonna go on forever well season one is always shorter than season

00:07:24.12 two there is an argument so this is I think what started this conversation was

00:07:29.20 looking at seasons on Disney plus and how nonsensical it is we're like season

00:07:35.11 one will be 72 episodes of duck tales and season two will be 16. Like I don't

00:07:40.10 think we need to follow a specific so what you're saying is that we're two

00:07:44.15 episodes longer than season one at this point I'll tell you I'll tell you what

00:07:47.16 I'm saying because I agree with you we I I think there's something to that let's

00:07:51.12 then just say because it makes no sense whatsoever which is very facey of us

00:07:56.21 that this is the first episode of season three year two okay okay

00:08:01.07 okay but still so the redemption year goes across multiple seasons

00:08:06.11 that's it's not a redemption season Gavin it's a redemption year yeah that's

00:08:11.06 fine I'm just season's not a year and a year is not a season if face was a tv

00:08:16.00 series and it was structured this way I would hate it I would hate watching face

00:08:21.07 in their season format it'd be horrendous it'd make no sense

00:08:26.02 it'd be terrible I'd like to play a clip just you know while we're doing some

00:08:29.23 housekeeping talking about stuff this is

00:08:32.01 whenever Gavin says I would like to play

00:08:34.06 a clip I'm terrified probably because 80

00:08:36.11 of the time it's been related to me I don't know if you feel the same way Geoff

00:08:39.12 but it is intimidating whenever Gavin says I'm gonna play a flip you may not

00:08:42.20 like do I feel intimidated that eighty percent of the time it's it's making fun

00:08:46.21 of you no no but I'm just saying well I feel like

00:08:49.19 I misspelled something probably um I I feel like uh last week this was two

00:08:55.18 weeks ago um Geoff made a joke during a discussion about the number 80.

00:08:59.12 And then I feel like I didn't really hear it at the time I feel like Andrew

00:09:03.01 never understood that it was a joke and just carried on carried on the

00:09:06.15 conversation see if this makes any sense to you Andrew okay I think there is we

00:09:09.21 just need to sit down and figure it out we're approaching a number of episodes

00:09:14.13 that no one can pitch in baseball that's true I think what's the fastest pitch

00:09:19.13 recorded and it's probably in like over a hundred I think uh I want to say 102

00:09:24.06 or so really I was thinking I was gonna guess like 110 would be my guess but I

00:09:29.09 don't think that high has anyone thrown one in a vacuum what do you mean uh

00:09:34.21 like has anyone thrown one at a vacuum cleaner

00:09:38.03 I don't understand like why why would they have done that

00:09:41.16 well so there's no air resistance so you can throw it real fast oh okay that's I

00:09:46.01 feel like you took some leaps there I wasn't I wasn't with you I was lost

00:09:49.20 sorry I was thinking about I've never seen someone throw a vacuum there was a

00:09:53.05 guy who got like what do you think we're talking

00:09:56.17 okay no no I know no no no I have an answer for that I have an answer for

00:10:00.21 that I remember that moment distinctly I was la I was confused by what you were

00:10:05.23 saying from the jump as soon as you said like I didn't know where you're going

00:10:09.23 from vacuum like I didn't expect a literal vacuum I didn't understand the

00:10:14.01 point you were trying to make from the beginning so as somebody who didn't

00:10:17.19 understand what was going on I was just like I'm going to play along with

00:10:20.17 whatever because I don't know what the road is I don't see where we're headed

00:10:24.00 because I feel like you came away from that conversation either thinking that

00:10:28.03 we were throwing a baseball a vacuum cleaner or throwing a vacuum cleaner and

00:10:33.01 I couldn't figure out what you'd take away no

00:10:35.03 I didn't take anything away from any of it okay I was just playing into whatever

00:10:39.03 was being said I understood that you didn't literally need a vacuum

00:10:44.00 I tell you where this is going this is going to our new I'm excited about this

00:10:48.12 this is going to our new sporting event that we're going to start it's not the

00:10:53.00 Olympics it's not track and field it's vac and field we're going to throw

00:10:57.12 vacuum cleaners like we're throwing a discus and see you can throw it the

00:11:00.16 farthest and then we're going to throw [ __ ] at vacuum cleaners and see who's

00:11:04.06 the most accurate and then we'll come up

00:11:06.01 with some other vac and field activities this is going to be awesome

00:11:10.06 I thought you were going a different way I thought baseball with only vacuums

00:11:16.13 like you everybody who's pitching okay that's perfect back and field I

00:11:20.05 can't wait 2022. Okay so you were just sort of uh going with the flow and I was

00:11:24.05 totally going with the flow because they didn't necessarily understand your

00:11:27.16 original point so it's just like wherever we go I'm just going to buy it

00:11:31.11 and I remember saying at the time or thinking at the time while I was saying

00:11:32.15 it like I don't I know we're not talking about actual vacuums but I don't know

00:11:36.20 what else to do here so I'm just going to keep talking

00:11:39.13 let me ask another question to that answer how often would you say that

00:11:43.09 happens to you through the recording of this podcast uh

00:11:46.07 you know it depends not often like are you do you think you you think you

00:11:50.08 follow 70 of what's happening oh definitely yeah I I follow a lot more than it

00:11:55.20 appears I wish I could say it was less it would it would like explain some of

00:12:01.11 my responses better but I have to just own up to

00:12:04.19 to that the fact I am listening 99 of the time

00:12:07.22 90 my ass no I'll get lost sometimes I would say you're listening 80 and you're

00:12:13.00 comprehending the guy that the guy that interrupts me every [ __ ] six minutes

00:12:18.12 is going to come at me for listening once again it's outrageous

00:12:23.17 how dare you outrageous I take this from Geoff I'm not taking it

00:12:29.03 from you you are so full of [ __ ]

00:12:31.19 you think I don't listen well you could you talk over me 80 so either there's

00:12:36.02 two options Gavin I either need to believe you're not listening

00:12:39.12 or you care so little about what I'm saying most of the time that you just

00:12:42.22 decide that whatever you're saying is more important so I'm gonna choose that

00:12:46.10 you're not listening I will say if we were in the same room I wouldn't

00:12:50.12 interrupt you as much it's mainly a discord thing an internet thing I I've

00:12:55.14 got bad internet you do but that's less fun

00:12:58.03 can I donate some money or something to help you get better

00:13:02.02 is that possible can we do that I feel like that's a thing that could be done

00:13:08.08 how do we improve your internet anything else you need to prove Gavin do

00:13:13.01 we stop at internet what else do you need do you need a new blender

00:13:16.12 do you need a blender appliance what's deficient in your life a vacuum what are

00:13:22.08 you lacking I need a new swiffer I'll just say that

00:13:25.12 right now I need that's that's something I need

00:13:28.17 product I'm lacking you need us what do you need to swift my wall

00:13:32.12 back of my wall I guess I don't need a swiffer for that I dropped another I've

00:13:38.02 had such a bad run of dropping things since we've last it just keeps happening

00:13:42.04 well so somebody went on your wool I probably shouldn't have I should have

00:13:45.20 like led to that later for like the story the best version of the stories in

00:13:50.19 the middle of a story I you were sort of like at the end of like the funniest

00:13:54.14 part of the story I dropped a milkshake

00:13:57.09 let's just pretend that part didn't okay we're just gonna pretend so I bought a

00:14:02.22 milkshake I got food over the weekend last weekend sometimes it's always good

00:14:06.17 to get some day yeah so I had a milkshake which I've never had we've

00:14:09.18 gone over I've never experienced a milkshake and I was like you know what

00:14:13.11 I'm gonna have you started in the middle of the story

00:14:16.10 you went back to the beginning yeah started I feel like a little bit

00:14:19.17 too early by saying you bought some food at the weekend like that's a given you

00:14:24.07 could go straight to no no I think it's different I think

00:14:27.20 contextually it's important because if you it's a different I feel

00:14:32.21 like it's more painful if I physically went to a place

00:14:37.05 got it than brought it I I only ordered food had it delivered made it to my door

00:14:42.13 walking up the stairs I get to my doorway I drop it and it hits at an

00:14:46.08 angle where it explodes on impact and it goes it covers the door it's once again

00:14:51.06 it's Geoff's smoothie problem it's like the fourth time this has happened to me

00:14:55.03 recently all over the door over the wall on the floor like just I didn't end up

00:14:59.16 drinking any of it I cleaned it I'm laying in bed the next

00:15:04.00 day and I look up and I have oreo on my wall I didn't realize how far it

00:15:07.07 exploded I have pieces of oreo all over my back wall cleaned up most of it some

00:15:11.14 of it is so high up I would love to have a swiffer extent use the stick is this

00:15:16.19 the one because you dropped one recently didn't

00:15:19.04 you that was made a lot worse by you picking it up or something like it was

00:15:22.19 tough oh that was the burger king soda it was well this was a burger king

00:15:28.04 milkshake I am I if I order burger king I am dropping the drink that's with it

00:15:33.05 and it is going everywhere this hasn't okay this

00:15:36.17 on Sunday I ordered food again I ordered

00:15:38.19 food for the different two days in a row you ate okay yeah

00:15:42.17 no I think it was like middle of the week I got the dates don't matter the

00:15:46.05 point is I the next time I ordered faith the next time I ordered food I ordered

00:15:52.00 Japanese food and I was very excited about it it's great but I'm nervous

00:15:57.11 because I keep dropping [ __ ] so I'm like [ __ ] this

00:16:01.07 this is a terrifying existence I'm in so I get I get my sushi I order sushi

00:16:06.14 and that's it it's hard to [ __ ] up sushi I have sushi it's in a bag why'd you

00:16:10.06 order it with a question mark because I'm I was trying to think if I ordered

00:16:13.22 other things that was me like trying to process I

00:16:17.01 ordered sushi I get my sushi I I walk it all the way up to my room I place it on

00:16:21.12 my bed to remove it from the bag I sit at my desk chair turn around

00:16:26.12 go to grab it from the bag the bag that contains the container

00:16:30.17 [ __ ] opens not even all the way it partially opens all of the sushi falls out

00:16:37.18 all of it I got it to my room on the bed

00:16:41.04 I'm lifting it out of the bag on the bed I had a bag of [ __ ] sushi it was just

00:16:46.12 a sushi bag oh my god it was the

00:16:53.20 it was truly terrible it was sad I had like four rolls on my bed and then

00:16:59.07 the rest all went to a bag and the lid didn't even fully pop off and I just sat

00:17:05.01 there I just sat there dejected saying how how

00:17:08.06 how did this happen how did this how they this is did you still eat them oh I

00:17:13.08 absolutely did that's what the box looked like they all slid out the bottom

00:17:18.01 they just all slid as soon as I was lifting it out of the bag what's the

00:17:22.00 green [ __ ] is that I have a wasabi that's wasabi so much wasabi there is a

00:17:26.17 lot of wasabi I have a feeling that's I have a feeling it's less than there was

00:17:32.07 Gavin but it got everywhere it was just all

00:17:35.02 over the place I've never been so sad and I refused to put it back in the

00:17:38.23 container so yeah I ate the sushi out of a bag I ate bagged sushi and it was

00:17:43.01 depressing on a different level you could at least put it on a plate so you

00:17:46.21 know no I was so it was like a punishment for

00:17:50.12 myself because I keep dropping things off like you just don't deserve good

00:17:54.04 things you get bagged sushi that's picture there that's like a banana skin

00:17:59.11 for you yeah it is yeah it was it was terrible oh man the

00:18:03.05 best of my life dropping stuff can I throw a sad food thing in as an it's not

00:18:08.00 even a real story it's just I've yeah absolutely I got nothing to talk about

00:18:12.03 this week pretty much sure so uh Gavin a couple last week I went to uh what's

00:18:17.06 quickly becoming one of my favorite restaurants in Austin and I mentioned it

00:18:20.11 to you because I know you like it a lot too it's a place called dip dip dip yeah

00:18:25.03 and they they make a just like it's just a really nice like uh I

00:18:30.00 I forget why it's it's like fancy hot pot kind of right and um

00:18:33.21 yeah there you go it's [ __ ] awesome and I fall in love with it and I eat

00:18:37.07 there a bunch now eat there all the time we went there last week and uh

00:18:40.12 we're sitting down and we're looking at the menu and they come over and they're

00:18:42.04 giving you the daily specials and I'm like I'm already pretty sure I know what

00:18:46.07 I want to get there because I have like a routine that I'm into and then she's

00:18:49.12 like well would you like to hear the specials and I'm like I guess and then

00:18:52.17 so she leads up she leads off specials the last special she goes and then we

00:18:55.16 have the most amazing two-week smoked and then she said the [ __ ] p

00:19:02.02 word and I almost threw up and it and I said all I could think

00:19:07.11 about all I could think about for the rest of the goddamn meal was that two

00:19:12.20 week old smoked p word was somewhere in the building with me like we were

00:19:16.17 coexisting in the same space and people around me were probably eating it and it

00:19:20.15 took everything I had to enjoy the evening because I was like I was like

00:19:24.13 there was a giant p word sandwich just on my shoulder looking over me and it

00:19:28.11 was oh it was terrifying that uh I bet it was delicious too because

00:19:32.19 everything's good there yeah I'm sure it was delicious I just like how

00:19:37.13 how far it has fallen for you knowing how exciting if that would have

00:19:42.10 happened to you like eight days prior or however many days before your

00:19:45.17 colonoscopy that would have been a dream dude it would be like if baseball cards

00:19:51.14 gave me cancer or something you know it's like I discovered it and I fell in

00:19:57.01 love with it hard and fast and I immersed my fully immersed myself in the

00:20:00.12 in the p-word world and I really I just embraced it

00:20:03.22 I was like eschewing it I was going on other podcasts to espouse the virtues of

00:20:09.01 p word like I was so [ __ ] into it and then I got the rug pulled out from under

00:20:14.23 me so hard and so fast I'm still spinning it sucks

00:20:18.12 I've been meaning to ask and thank you for bringing this up it reminded me I

00:20:23.05 was curious if you have begun a journey for a new

00:20:25.21 thing to replace that maybe in the deli world like are you just sort of in a

00:20:29.15 place of sadness right now of like processing your loss I'll be honest I'm

00:20:33.11 kind of lost in the woods right now just

00:20:36.00 in general it's it's been a rough couple weeks and uh yeah I'm just I'm I mean

00:20:39.10 I'm not I don't have the energy to search for a new passion right now to be

00:20:43.12 honest with you and I bet just all daily meets is similar looking

00:20:47.16 ugh yeah that's probably guilty by association right yeah um I

00:20:51.08 you talked about dropping [ __ ] this [ __ ] morning I had a sequence of events

00:20:55.15 I wanted to I wanted to smash my head through a [ __ ] brick wall today.

00:21:00.21 [Laughter]

00:21:02.17 I got up this morning and I do my morning routine which is a whole you

00:21:06.02 know it's the the the feed the kid the dogs the the poops the peas the get

00:21:09.20 ready make the lunches make coffee eat the whole thing and it's fine I'm a

00:21:13.06 morning person I'm into it it's cool and then like Millie was kind of dragging

00:21:16.10 today a little bit you know uh which is fine because we have like a 30 minute

00:21:20.03 window she likes to get school a little early to visit with her friends and so

00:21:24.02 it's not the end of the world but I had at 10 a.m I had a an appointment to get

00:21:29.07 a bunch of x-rays on my body so that we can figure out why

00:21:32.14 I can't sit anymore and if I can if I will ever ever be able to ride a bicycle

00:21:37.22 again because we're going on about a month now that I haven't gotten any

00:21:41.10 activity or physical exercise uh and so I'm like I'm looking at march I'm like

00:21:44.21 that's not no I'll just I'm trying to think of like I go to a coffee shop for

00:21:48.03 like 20 minutes kill some time and then I'll head over because I've got this

00:21:51.08 weird window uh where it doesn't make sense to come home or whatever and then

00:21:55.02 I get my phone texts I get a text and I look and it's the appointment people

00:21:58.13 saying hey [ __ ] your appointment's at nine it's not a ten it's at nine and I'm

00:22:02.12 like [ __ ] so I like have to run grab billy and run out the door and like

00:22:07.17 drive like hall ask the high school throw her at the school and then I look

00:22:11.10 at the back of the sheet it has the address because there's like two central

00:22:15.01 locations because like it's like 30

00:22:17.09 places you can go on the back of the sheet and you just you know I schedule

00:22:20.19 the one close to me of which there's two

00:22:23.07 so I drive in it's like a hospital thing so I gotta go in I gotta go through the

00:22:26.12 ticket counter get a ticket find a parking space run through the thing go

00:22:31.04 over like a bridge you know through another structure to get in there to the

00:22:35.18 x-ray place and I hand them my paper and they go

00:22:38.23 hey [ __ ] you're at the wrong place and I'm like what and they're like no

00:22:43.14 place you are the place you are is two blocks away and I'm like mother [ __ ]

00:22:48.19 in my haste I was freaking out I picked the wrong goddamn x-ray store oh right

00:22:53.12 so then I grab everything and I run I get back in my car I I [ __ ] have to

00:22:57.20 pay to get out of the parking garage to go to the other to the other place to

00:23:01.09 the new x-ray store right to buy x-rays or whatever and I [ __ ] go and I go

00:23:04.23 all they do I get this one's in a parking garage so I gotta go like the [ __ ]

00:23:09.12 the [ __ ] fifth floor I finally get there I have one minute and I'm like I'm

00:23:14.17 gonna [ __ ] make this I I grab my phone uh I open my door I run out I slam

00:23:20.04 my door I turn towards the elevator and I throw my [ __ ] phone across the

00:23:23.16 parking lot and I smash my phone

00:23:27.01 my brand new iPhone 26 or whatever it is yeah what's the new one

00:23:32.12 62. I got I got an iPhone 19 and it's smash I'm so [ __ ] annoyed

00:23:39.18 so mad oh man that's still so new I know yeah it feels a little weird to have a

00:23:45.03 busted up spider veined screen phone right now

00:23:49.09 oh because you went to the wrong x-ray store how unfortunate if only because I

00:23:54.22 well at the end of the day it's all because I

00:23:57.06 misremembered my appointment time but yeah but you made it on time

00:24:01.09 I did make it on time and I got the x-rays and hopefully we'll find out

00:24:05.02 which of the big three I have you know I went to a doctor yesterday because I

00:24:08.18 don't know if we covered this last week but I think we might have I just the

00:24:11.20 intense amount of pain I'm in I've been in I don't remember I don't think did I

00:24:16.14 not even mention it I don't think you've

00:24:19.03 talked about that I haven't talked about it well I talked about how I started my

00:24:21.07 butt started to hurt right in the butt yes and so I started to wear those

00:24:24.19 shorts right and then I told the story about how I put my pants on over the

00:24:27.18 shorts and I went to the grocery store and then I realized when the lady gave

00:24:30.18 me the dirty look I had a dumpy butt yeah like my butt was like folded in

00:24:35.12 half it was weird anyway so eventually the shorts

00:24:39.11 didn't work like the pain was too much that I just had to stop riding my bike

00:24:43.11 all together uh and that was fine except the pain

00:24:47.06 followed me and then it got worse and worse and then for about four days

00:24:53.01 week before last or last week somewhere in there I uh I couldn't sit like

00:24:58.08 if I sat down it would the pain was so intense and maybe like I would cry I uh

00:25:03.14 and I'm a very manly non-crying type person so it was you can tell uh so I

00:25:08.07 could only stand or I could only lay down and I was just in an incredible

00:25:12.23 amount of pain and uh so I went to the doctor I

00:25:15.17 scheduled an appointment and I went to the doctor yesterday and he looked me

00:25:19.20 over and you know he ordered the x-rays and he said that it's either tendonitis

00:25:25.11 bursitis or arthritis but it's definitely an it is

00:25:29.09 and I'm like okay well what do we do and he's like well you're too young for

00:25:33.19 arthritis and I said let me stop you there let me tell you about

00:25:37.18 and he goes no you don't have arthritis and I go I have a lot of arthritis on my

00:25:41.09 shoulder and he's like how do you know and I go well I got an mri and he goes

00:25:43.07 oh you do have arthritis so yeah and he goes well it could be that and I go so

00:25:46.19 what do we do for these three things he goes well if it's tendinitis you know

00:25:49.18 we'll put you on a treatment regimen you'll do a significant amount of

00:25:52.21 physical therapy and then you'll be on your way if it's bursitis we'll put you

00:25:56.13 on a different treatment regimen you'll do a tremendous amount of uh

00:26:01.05 uh physical therapy and then you'll be on your way and if it's arthritis uh

00:26:05.12 there's not much treatment we can do but you'll do a tremendous amount of

00:26:09.03 physical therapy and be on your way so no matter what I'm about to go through

00:26:12.23 another god knows how long of [ __ ]

00:26:14.19 physical therapy and I'm really jazzed about having another appointment every

00:26:18.04 week do you think it's just for good at this point yeah just constant

00:26:21.03 maintenance I well yeah I honestly I do I mean yeah I think

00:26:26.04 so I think once you get to the advanced age of 46 or so yeah I

00:26:30.04 think that your life becomes about managing medical appointments and stuff

00:26:35.02 it sucks I need to live more in the moment I need to appreciate my

00:26:40.01 my fine body right now yeah and I I'll be honest with you uh

00:26:44.21 and I say this without uh any ill uh feelings or or

00:26:48.16 uh but I I don't think you'll age as well I think it's gonna be hard on you

00:26:53.18 I think I think your body I think your body's

00:26:56.17 going to have a tough time really just I

00:26:58.18 don't know just something about you yeah and I don't mean that to poke fun

00:27:02.17 you know I just like I'm afraid I'm afraid for you

00:27:06.13 a little bit well you heard it here first

00:27:08.15 I I want you to know I will be here for you I'm your friend be the worst thing a

00:27:12.13 friend has ever said what then I'll be here for you I'll

00:27:16.21 wheel you around dude I'm [ __ ] don't worry about it what's gonna happen to me

00:27:21.10 I I don't know but I'll I don't know but it will

00:27:24.23 if you need like you need me to wipe your face after stuff you know because

00:27:28.09 you can't or you need me to put like tighten the blanket around your legs in

00:27:32.13 the chair whatever I can do I'm gonna be there for you

00:27:35.18 I'm just trying like evaluating this for Gavin I think a question he should be

00:27:39.16 asking you Geoff is there anything you miss that you could do before physically

00:27:44.10 that you no longer can riding bikes I haven't ridden my bike in almost a

00:27:50.00 month I want to ride a bike so badly I bet I'm gonna get injured riding a bike

00:27:55.07 because I'm trying to use up all of the fine bike time I have left too soon I'm

00:27:59.12 gonna be like strutting around on a bike because I can

00:28:02.17 and it's gonna cause me to not be able to ride bikes anymore it's a delicate

00:28:08.04 balance for sure and it sucks too also don't don't

00:28:11.18 tie your coping mechanism here's a piece of real advice don't tie your coping

00:28:16.19 mechanisms to physical [ __ ] that's gonna

00:28:19.18 break down later in life because uh as we all know I was a tremendous alcoholic

00:28:23.22 for 20 something years uh and I'm now almost five years sober so that no

00:28:28.23 problems there but uh uh I when I stopped drinking and realized I

00:28:33.01 had to actually process and deal with emotions and pain

00:28:36.05 uh part of the way I was able to do that was with this stupid bicycle you know

00:28:39.11 riding my bike people say like there's no way he's riding 20 miles a week or 20

00:28:43.06 miles a day or whatever and even on an e-bike and I'm like no he I really do

00:28:47.03 have that much [ __ ] to work out you know

00:28:51.16 work through and uh losing that ability I didn't I realized I had been on edge

00:28:56.17 for like the entire month I got so bad yesterday I had to go to the park and I

00:29:01.10 I sat in the park and on a park bench and I just cried for like like maybe 30

00:29:06.15 minutes because I didn't know how to process I

00:29:09.04 didn't I just sat there and thought about alcohol which I don't ever do and

00:29:13.05 bike riding and just how sad I was that there was like no way for me to like

00:29:17.12 work through this and you know and I was working through it in the moment but so

00:29:20.21 so my real advice to you would be like don't tie your coping mechanisms to

00:29:24.11 wheels because when the wheels break or you break then you lose your coping

00:29:27.20 mechanisms and then you gotta find a point and that's

00:29:30.06 free to always text me by the way if you

00:29:32.14 need your mind taken off something or if you don't want to cry in a park I'm

00:29:36.23 always here for you here's the deal though uh and I appreciate that but if I

00:29:40.12 were to text you either of you there'd be a 50 chance I wouldn't get a response

00:29:45.11 and that would make it worse look look if you text saying hey you

00:29:49.16 want to do x that's a response if you if it's Wednesday morning and you you

00:29:54.21 say boy do I have a story for tomorrow yeah there's a

00:29:58.21 there's a park bench that's very conciliatory

00:30:02.10 in zilker park that has been there for me a lot lately and said I'm good with

00:30:07.05 the park bench but then I think we should start one wheeling around I've

00:30:10.10 been going on your path on on one we've been going over I've been going by your

00:30:14.14 jump every day haven't yet taken it on on the one wheel because I'll die

00:30:18.23 it's a it's a nice graceful path it's very peaceful and you don't have to if

00:30:22.22 I'm ever able if I'm ever able to move my body in that way again uh I I will I

00:30:28.08 can't imagine the pain that would be caused from falling off a one wheel right

00:30:32.02 now but you know listen within 24 hours I'm going to get a diagnosis

00:30:36.01 and then I'll know what's wrong with me and then I can work towards getting

00:30:39.14 better and then I'll get back on I'll ride that bike again someday god damn it

00:30:43.03 I will I'm not worried about that yeah that's very exciting anyway uh all

00:30:48.02 I had today was uh was the fact that I smashed my phone out of stupidity

00:30:52.10 and that uh it's season three now I thought

00:30:55.13 what's that what's up Henry you're gonna

00:30:57.18 say I was just gonna say something but I don't know if you're gonna lead it I I

00:31:01.14 Geoff just reminded me of a thing that I didn't write down to talk

00:31:05.11 uh is that what you're also going to talk about Gavin texted me late

00:31:09.17 on Thursday night what did he text me he text me something

00:31:12.14 along the lines of and I don't know if you have it you can read it

00:31:15.23 I just was horrified by a turkey sandwich was essentially the core of the

00:31:20.08 message and I looked at it and in a Geoff like

00:31:23.16 fashion I thought do I want to know what this is is this is this for the show

00:31:28.14 should I ask like obviously I'd like to know but it feels like a show thing I

00:31:32.19 think what I text you was I just got one

00:31:36.02 of the biggest frights of my life from a turkey sandwich yes

00:31:39.07 so I didn't reply to it that night but then I remembered replying to it the

00:31:44.04 next day and then I never heard back from Gavin and I was like I must have

00:31:49.11 been busy I know that game yeah but then I got I got a text on

00:31:53.19 a different day like four days later three days later and I just didn't send

00:31:58.10 the message I just wrote it and then I never hit send

00:32:00.19 I just I missed it but I've been waiting I've been like it's weird didn't it was

00:32:04.19 me and then so if something else was asked completely irrelated not not

00:32:08.14 really irrelated that's not a word honestly I'm not gonna yeah I'm not

00:32:11.15 gonna get an irregardless on that that was just me [ __ ] up that was me

00:32:15.21 but I just [ __ ] up I didn't get it but

00:32:17.21 I I want to know you asked me to guess I couldn't think of a way that a turkey

00:32:21.19 sandwich could horrify anyone do you have any immediate thoughts it was more

00:32:25.15 extreme than I I thought I was gonna die you thought you're gonna die yeah yeah

00:32:30.06 for a first place second but it was a turkey sandwich.

00:32:35.07 I have no [ __ ] clue it's like maybe it was moldy turkey or I bet

00:32:41.03 I could put this out there to the public for a year no one a 100 guarantee

00:32:47.09 no one would ever come up with the scenario because it makes absolutely no

00:32:52.09 sense should I run you through it I'd love please please

00:32:56.02 um you want to preview the end of the story first like in milkshake fashion or

00:32:59.18 are you just going to get right start at the beginning

00:33:03.11 I'll start the beginning um okay it was embarrassing um I was I was on a plane

00:33:09.08 and I think my subconscious had just been slightly affected by the fact that

00:33:15.05 um I saw this on my phone just on the home screen of

00:33:18.22 my phone on the weather app it said uh small aircraft advisory and I thought

00:33:24.23 well that probably is something to do with

00:33:28.15 you know if you're in a small aircraft maybe visibility is [ __ ]

00:33:32.17 or something to do with that but in my head I was thinking like

00:33:36.16 I think I was like dozing off or something I was thinking like oh does

00:33:40.13 that mean there's like a shitload of small planes around

00:33:43.07 like our plane our plane is like gonna have to dodge a bunch of small planes

00:33:47.20 there was like a one percent of my brain that thought that's what it meant

00:33:51.19 there's a swarm of small planes outside yeah the rest of my my brain was like oh

00:33:56.21 it's probably foggy or something and as you can see by the screens hot I'm

00:34:00.12 apparently over the north Atlantic ocean

00:34:03.08 I was I then I decided I'll just keep an eye out I'll look out the window.

00:34:09.09 [Laughter]

00:34:10.10 Just make sure there's noises like a swarm of planes

00:34:14.02 you're keeping an eye out how does that help are you like ready to yell at like

00:34:19.23 what is the plan like I'm gonna be on guard guys like what why

00:34:24.09 what I should point out I'd slept for about two hours the night before so I

00:34:28.04 was there okay it's like you're on a plane and you're dumb because you're

00:34:31.10 tired just one of those days yeah and I was looking out the window and suddenly

00:34:37.05 I got the fright of my life in my peripheral vision

00:34:40.12 I I saw what I thought was a plane hurtling into the side of our plane

00:34:46.12 and let me post a picture all it was was the flight attendant

00:34:51.09 sliding a turkey sandwich onto the plate onto the tray of the guy behind me

00:34:57.12 but in my peripheral vision because it was under his light

00:35:01.11 because it's under his light it just came like at the plane in the

00:35:05.16 reflection and I jumped back and I was like.

00:35:12.11 [Music]

00:35:13.18 But um yeah it was just perfectly because there was nothing on his tray

00:35:18.08 there was like nothing lit up until the flight attendant aggressively slid a

00:35:23.10 turkey sandwich which just caused a weird optical illusion and at that point

00:35:28.15 I was just like I need to get some sleep my heart was beating like hundreds

00:35:33.16 a minute for like two straight minutes because I thought I was gonna die

00:35:38.08 it came out of nowhere man it came did you scream out loudly yeah I was just

00:35:43.00 like

00:35:45.03 did anybody notice I don't know I was too embarrassed to look around

00:35:51.11 I don't think he needed to put the turkey sandwich there with such force it

00:35:57.06 looked like he was coming at like

00:36:04.17 instead of a uap you saw a uat [Laughter]

00:36:14.12 do you think anyone would have guessed that I don't I don't know not only do I

00:36:19.05 think nobody would have guessed that I don't think anyone in the history of the

00:36:23.05 earth has ever mistaken a turkey sandwich for an airplane I'm notoriously

00:36:27.23 bad with the reflections did I tell you about the time where I got scared by

00:36:32.06 someone because I thought they were me [Laughter]

00:36:36.17 I was walking into a hotel a glass door and I could see my reflection

00:36:42.17 in the glass and I and I go all the way to the door and I open the door and I

00:36:48.01 realized it wasn't my reflection it was just a man on the inside of the hotel

00:36:52.07 wearing the exact same colored shirt as me and we were moving and putting our

00:36:56.13 arms out at the exact same time he was mimicking me entirely and so when I

00:37:01.11 opened the door and he was there I just jumped down my skin

00:37:05.15 I don't deal with reflections oh well oh man nick nick brought up jack's going

00:37:10.23 to have good luck he wrote good luck jack figure I cannot wait to hear jack's

00:40:20.08 online therapy we talk about better help a lot on this show and this month we're

00:40:26.06 discussing some of the stigmas around mental health for example some people

00:40:30.07 think you should wait until things are unbearable to go to therapy but that's

00:40:35.07 not true you don't wait till your bone is extra extra broken before you get it

00:40:39.01 set therapy is a tool to utilize before things get worse and it can help you

00:40:43.14 avoid those lows you wouldn't drive your car around with no oil and think I'll

00:40:47.20 get to it eventually when the problems when I throw a rod no you take care of

00:40:52.02 it while it's still manageable many people think therapy is for so-called

00:40:56.04 crazy people but therapy doesn't mean something's wrong with you it means that

00:41:01.05 you recognize that all humans have emotions and we need to learn to control

00:41:04.16 them not avoid them remember the only way out is through as smarter people

00:41:09.15 than me have told me we've also been taught that mental health shouldn't be a

00:41:13.08 part of normal life but that's wrong too these are old antiquated ideas we take

00:41:18.21 care of our bodies with the gym the doctor with nutrition so focus on our

00:41:24.19 minds as well it's just as important I have been in and out of therapy now for

00:41:30.23 15 years or so and uh it has really helped me through some of the most

00:41:34.09 difficult periods of my life and now I'm kind of at a point where

00:41:39.11 it just it just kind of helps me see things clearly it's great to have

00:41:43.05 somebody to bounce uh things off of and uh and you know kind of check me and

00:41:47.09 make sure I'm uh I'm keeping up to date on all the things that I need to be

00:42:38.12 hold on a second uh hello and welcome to another episode of

00:42:42.10 F**kFuckFacePodcast this is episode 82

00:42:46.02 uh big surprise this is episode one of season three year two of the face

00:42:52.02 podcast congratulations guys we made it into third into the third season let's

00:42:57.02 hope we get renewed anyway you were saying I if we want to take it away from

00:43:00.12 food I do I have a quick question for Andrew just because we were on the

00:43:04.07 subject of movies go ahead um and I just thought this would be I think you would

00:43:07.23 have an answer for this maybe okay what is what is the perfect escalation of a

00:43:12.17 scenario between the original movie and the sequel like

00:43:17.04 where they were clearly paying homage to their original movie but also trying to

00:43:21.08 one-up it and I think I have the perfect answer I'd like to hear your answer

00:43:24.17 first to get a better understanding of kind of where your head is at with this

00:43:29.11 yeah I'm right there too uh the paint cans in home alone

00:43:33.17 funny in the first one they nail it they both take a paint can to the face the

00:43:37.02 second one they're ready for the paint cans they've dodged them both and then

00:43:40.18 they take a big metal bar right in the face it's one of the best moments of the

00:43:45.17 movie and it shows so well there's like I usually don't like a lot of quick cuts

00:43:50.08 because I I just tend to like as much to be done in the same shot as possible

00:43:54.13 especially with action but their every single shot in that

00:43:58.09 sequence is an absolute masterpiece the thing hits them in the face it looks

00:44:02.04 like it hits them in the face it's like a split second cut where they're just

00:44:06.19 falling backwards down a hole it's like a half second shot that must have taken

00:44:11.22 like an entire day to set up it's an absolutely crazy sequence and I think

00:44:16.17 the perfect escalation of an original movie I think that

00:44:20.21 I think the thing that makes those home alone movies so great

00:44:24.10 is that they treat human beings like like their wily coyote right it's like a

00:44:29.20 cartoon in a [ __ ] bugs bunny commercial or a bug money cartoon it's

00:44:35.09 just they give if they got hit in real life by that pipe

00:44:38.02 their skulls would cave in yeah their heads would have been knocked

00:44:43.03 off yeah you know yeah and if that didn't kill him the fall

00:44:47.07 would have it's so [ __ ] funny Kevin McAllister would be he would be in jail

00:44:52.10 for homicide I think it's self-defense but

00:44:55.20 yeah ah the the classic Michael Myers defense the Halloween seven

00:45:00.12 I'm trying to think like that's an interesting it's not even necessarily

00:45:04.12 it's like I'm sequel to a movie in which the characters are the same and they're

00:45:08.19 doing a similar task but they've learned something from the first one that

00:45:12.21 somehow broadens their knowledge yeah I just remember liking that so much

00:45:18.13 as a kid when a when the same actor as the same character would

00:45:22.20 reference or remember something from the previous movie I just used to eat that

00:45:27.07 [ __ ] up like even in the mummy like when Brendan Fraser would be like ah not

00:45:31.12 these guys again like stuff like that when I was 11. I loved it because it was

00:45:35.07 like oh I'm in on this reference that's a that's a great question that I

00:45:40.10 don't have an answer to I'm trying to think man the the last movie question

00:45:44.03 you had I felt like I had 400 answers immediately I got nothing for this

00:45:47.23 because a lot of movies don't do it well they'll either go way overboard or

00:45:51.21 something will happen and they won't remember that it's happened before and

00:45:55.07 stuff like that it was just it was ideal yeah I'm trying to think of just like

00:45:58.23 sequels in general I feel like there must have been

00:46:01.14 something they learned between independence day one and two but what

00:46:05.22 that was I couldn't tell you I have no idea but I'm sure there was something um

00:46:11.23 oh uh how about karate kid two when Daniel goes to do the [ __ ] leg

00:46:17.01 kick and the dude's like yeah I saw that

00:46:19.11 before [ __ ] you and then he has to come up with a whole new way to fight I

00:46:22.22 haven't seen karate kid two but it's the second one you guys never saw

00:46:27.11 cardigan two no wow he goes to okinawa and fights in

00:46:31.12 okinawa and over there they know all of his tricks yeah [Laughter]

00:46:36.05 you guys should see it it was real good um

00:46:40.04 [ __ ] I don't yeah that's that's a great

00:46:42.04 I'll have to think we'll come back to it we'll come back

00:46:45.01 to it speaking of Andrew did you because you said you were going to did you ever

00:46:48.17 watch home sweet home alone I was going to last night and I I forgot well I

00:46:53.09 remember I forgot until last night then I didn't I was like I probably won't

00:46:57.12 come up today and I was wrong I was clearly wrong about that because every

00:47:01.21 time I prepare for a thing uh it never happens so I thought ah this

00:47:06.17 will this will be another one of those I'm just glad I randomly watched the

00:47:11.20 mummy yesterday I had no idea it was going to come up 17

00:47:15.01 times during the session I don't I don't believe you I don't believe that you

00:47:18.19 watched the mummy oh no nor should you that was obviously I was full of [ __ ]

00:47:24.06 yeah I didn't actually watch them wait a minute does Geoff watch survivor wait

00:47:28.03 does Geoff not know sarcasm can we do this to him is he not because everyone

00:47:32.21 else just I don't think you know how to be

00:47:34.23 sarcastic Geoff no I think that you just don't know how to read sarcasm I I don't

00:47:39.16 know the whole room I think the whole room believed your mummy lie [Music]

00:47:45.01 well I think that says a lot about the room

00:47:49.05 uh yeah yeah yeah no I'm not gonna argue yeah yeah

00:47:51.18 I'm not going to counter that point you're completely accurate nick did you

00:47:55.18 believe him too he said absolutely nick nick absolutely did as

00:48:00.04 well he's being sarcastic you guys can't read it the problem is with this show

00:48:04.12 specifically there's so many dumb coincidences that is that have happened

00:48:09.18 during the entirety of our up to now three season run

00:48:12.11 that it wouldn't be out of the question that you would have happened to have

00:48:15.19 watched the mummy the day before I will give you that it is so [ __ ] absurd

00:48:20.20 that I find it hard to believe some of the coincidences that are happening and

00:48:24.21 they're happening to me you know you're [ __ ] you're right this it's this

00:48:28.08 podcast is either charmed or cursed I think depending on how you look at it

00:48:33.09 I go with charmed but I would go with charmed as well um

00:48:37.15 I have a thing I was going to talk about

00:48:39.22 not food related either I got a bunch of things that are food related it's just

00:48:43.01 weirdly food heavy you can you could do food I could do food well I'll do I'm

00:48:46.02 curious about your answer but I have a feeling it might be like gavin's

00:48:49.05 question where I don't know if you guys will have an answer to this it was just

00:48:53.22 an odd thought I had today what is the thing that you've done the most

00:48:57.12 without doing it is there a thing that you can so I'll

00:49:01.09 give you an example and I'm not proud of this

00:49:03.23 but I was listening to a thing and that they were talking about how like yeah

00:49:08.04 you buy this product and they will plant a tree every for everyone that's bought

00:49:12.16 they will plant a tree with the money you spent on it I don't think I've ever

00:49:18.02 planted a tree before but I've planted so many trees I've bought so many things

00:49:22.07 that have planted trees or have like I even switched to the web browser that

00:49:25.20 was like we'll plant a tree every however many searches you can see how

00:49:29.06 many trees you planted I've done that I've planted a [ __ ] ton of trees I don't

00:49:33.01 think I've ever actually personally physically planted a tree

00:49:36.23 I guess in a similar vein I've we've raised like a lot of money for kids I've

00:49:42.07 never given money to a kid

00:49:45.01 this is this could take a really bad turn I've killed so many people in halo

00:49:51.04 I've never murdered anybody it's probably that it's probably all the

00:49:55.17 people I murdered online yeah throughout the course of my life

00:49:59.23 uh-huh oh my god hmm I mean I've it there's there's a lot of

00:50:03.16 stuff that I think about that's not the same but it's similar

00:50:07.00 where it's like I think I've worked out way more in the sims than I have in real

00:50:10.16 life and that makes me sad to think about how about what do you think what

00:50:13.21 do you think is the thing that you've paid for the most that you've used the

00:50:17.09 least because you say that and I instantly think of the two years I had a

00:50:20.15 gym membership that I forgot about that I never went to

00:50:23.12 oh paid the most and use the lease like you had an Xbox live account for three

00:50:27.09 years you didn't know about you're paying 10 bucks a month for yeah or

00:50:30.22 whatever yeah Gavin the usa yeah and I and I bought a month's worth so it

00:50:35.18 was renewing at the I think it was renewing at 10 a month and I forgot

00:50:40.07 about it for three years livid about it and it's for

00:50:43.20 one video it was just to make that worms video before my

00:50:47.12 account could migrate over to the us or something I had to make an interim

00:50:52.12 account I bought dlc for a call of duty game I never ended up buying

00:50:56.23 that has haunted me to this day I spent ten dollars on dlc thank you dlc

00:51:03.16 I I own a piece of dlc for call of duty world at war because I was like yeah

00:51:08.17 I'll buy that game again down the road and I never bought it again but I'm

00:51:11.18 still mindful and aware of the fact that I bought that dlc and I never played it

00:51:16.03 does it let you buy the dlc yeah it was just because it was like a digital this

00:51:20.07 was 360 era so not a lot of digital full game purchases but you would download

00:51:24.07 the dlc so I bought like some map pack or like zombies I don't know

00:51:28.02 what I bought I bought a piece of dlc for world at war and I'd already played

00:51:32.01 it and returned it at that point and I planned on buying it again and I just

00:51:36.03 never did that part so I own the dlc I've never played it it was probably

00:51:39.21 zombie related because I think that was the first call of duty to introduce

00:51:43.13 zombies if I remember correctly I feel like it was a thing where I saw like oh

00:51:47.10 there's some zombie dlc I could get some achievements in this this will be fun I

00:51:50.17 bought it and then I never followed through and bought the actual game to

00:51:53.23 play it you should go back and get those achievements now I'm still I'm just

00:51:57.21 trying to get 50 cent why is that not part of the redemption year because I I

00:52:02.10 really don't want to play call of duty world at war

00:52:05.12 that game made me quit playing call of duty games campaigns the reef spawn

00:52:09.18 didn't they change the respawn in that one where it's like they they would comp

00:52:13.13 like they would not stop respawning no matter how many yeah I I was like

00:52:18.06 playing on veteran or whatever the hardest difficulty is and I got stuck in

00:52:21.16 this bunker high like on like a normandy type level

00:52:24.08 it might have been normandy for all I remember I I don't know it was so long

00:52:27.12 ago and I was like every time I tried to peek out they would they would [ __ ]

00:52:31.08 peg me and so I was just trying to figure out how to get out and I was like

00:52:34.19 stuck in there I'd checkpoint and I was trying to just figure out like how do I

00:52:38.23 you know like everything I tried uh failed but I was safe in the in the

00:52:43.05 bunker and then after like five minutes they just started spawning grenades in

00:52:46.15 the bunker and I was like all right [ __ ] that sucks [ __ ] you I'm done

00:52:51.04 and so I never went back I don't know I don't know that I played another call of

00:52:55.03 duty campaign after that for years probably they're [ __ ] expensive to

00:52:58.10 buy digitally still they like just they only sell like the ultra bundled it's

00:53:03.11 still like 50 bucks to buy a world at war [ __ ] nick

00:53:06.04 nick said he's he's eating a lot of apples but he's never picked one from a

00:53:09.12 tree that's a good point you've never okay well this will this will lead to

00:53:14.19 another thing there is something the apple experience is enhanced when

00:53:18.11 you pick it from the tree I don't care if you're baking it like if you're if

00:53:21.14 you're picking your own apples and then turning it into a pie better than any

00:53:26.08 other pie you'll have anywhere else I feel sad for [ __ ] no it it it's

00:53:30.19 just a thing I legally or scrumptious it's always a little bit better

00:53:34.13 look go and pick some apples off a tree yeah I'll make a pie with them and also

00:53:39.11 make a pie with some apples that I got and you you're saying you could tell the

00:53:43.11 difference I could tell the difference yeah absolutely it's a vibe thing you

00:53:47.12 can just it feel that's a nonsense are you right okay well do you want to hear

00:53:50.16 another another thing that you're gonna hate in the utter nonsense category it

00:53:56.06 was snowing it snowed here a few days ago and I realized that coca-cola tastes

00:54:02.10 better when it's snowing outside specifically when it's in a can

00:54:06.23 a coca-cola a coke in the snow in a can form is my snow beverage of choice

00:54:12.00 is it because of the ads with like Santa and all that it could be like yeah the

00:54:16.17 polar bears like it could be part of it I can't explain to you why but it tastes

00:54:21.14 better it tastes better when it's snug I'm gonna I'm gonna support both of

00:54:25.07 those statements Andrew I'm I'm I'm with you on both of those the apple and the

00:54:29.19 coke I'm not saying the vibe doesn't like increase the enjoyment but it's not

00:54:34.04 there's no way it transfers to the taste it's all part of the experience though

00:54:37.19 once again we're talking to the guy that [ __ ] hates tasting anything there's

00:54:41.20 less food you're not a food guy in any way you think it's all the same rating

00:54:45.18 apple sixes across the board that ever happens no kidding you got you got

00:54:49.11 [ __ ]

00:54:50.21 You live in fear of turkey sandwiches for Christ [Laughter]

00:54:55.12 I feel like you're the worst person like I agree with what you're saying like I

00:55:00.00 understand it it isn't true but it is true like it's not true it makes no

00:55:04.17 sense it shouldn't be true but in my heart it is true

00:55:07.20 I would say the snow thing is more likely to be true because potentially

00:55:11.12 the air tastes different when it's snowing

00:55:15.04 I was inspired yeah never mind I think it's looking out the window

00:55:19.23 I think what we should do I think I like that I try and

00:55:25.09 the one percent of the conversation I can defend him with he's like no

00:55:32.00 oh yeah yeah I've been uh I guess I'll just do all the food I got

00:55:36.12 a a cheese advent calendar I've been exploring cheese I'm not a chea I don't

00:55:41.14 I've never really had cheese before it's science say it I'm not a cheese guy you

00:55:46.00 can say it I'm not a cheese guy but I am a cheese guy I'm a very specific cheese

00:55:49.12 guy I like it melted and I still am holding that opinion are we talking like

00:55:53.21 a British cheese advent calendar we are yes it is a British cheese actually I

00:55:58.23 already tell you which is the best one in there

00:56:02.15 what is what is the best one the best cheese in there is smoked apple wood

00:56:08.02 I enjoy the smell of smoked apple wood a lot

00:56:10.06 okay cheese is fine it's okay it's not bad

00:56:13.05 interesting because that because that's the best if we were doing a ch if if if

00:56:17.07 I was keeping a list of my top seven cheeses a secret from you and you found

00:56:21.14 my secret document smoked dapper would be number one

00:56:24.20 really that's your number one cheese number one cheese in the world

00:56:28.12 oh you should tell that to the celebrity cheese monger dude oh you know what's

00:56:32.16 exciting about that that box Gavin I don't remember what it's called oh I'm

00:56:36.08 not gonna pull it out cause I'd have to move my mic to get it um

00:56:41.05 my mic stand is in front of my fridge and it would be a whole thing to like

00:56:45.14 pull the box out one of the cheeses in that box talk about coincidences is the

00:56:50.05 same cheese they use when they race cheese when they roll it down the hill

00:56:54.12 for the cheese rice oh it's all connected yes

00:56:57.16 I don't remember what it is but what is this the man who has 400 celebrities for

00:57:02.01 their there's a cheese guy he's famous he he spams every per every

00:57:06.06 celebrity on twitter to ask them what their favorite cheese is and then he

00:57:09.05 records it and puts it in his cheese book he's got like a crazy amount of

00:57:13.02 celebrities that have responded to him I just don't have that for later I don't

00:57:14.23 want to interrupt your story now no this is an important it's important addition

00:57:19.09 I just I joe bengals advent calendar is underutilized like if

00:57:23.22 somebody who doesn't I would never opt to just have cheese

00:57:27.18 like I wouldn't order a cheese plate I get a little a little bit of cheese

00:57:31.15 every day I'm expanding my food horizons do you also get a stupid joke on the

00:57:35.17 inside of the door no it's just like a little thing you can color in if you

00:57:39.04 want to okay there's no joke but I just I feel like I don't know why advent

00:57:43.18 calendars are just Christmas related I would buy a cheese calendar for February

00:57:49.08 should we have the official face February February cheese calendar

00:57:54.12 I just think that it's a fun way to try things that I'm on the fence about I

00:57:59.11 feel like I could like cold cheese I will say I started I picked this up on

00:58:05.01 the 8th of December I ate the first you want to eat a basic cheddar by itself I

00:58:10.13 ate the apple smoke your favorite Gavin I tried that by itself I then took days

00:58:15.10 three through six put them on a thing of grilled cheese

00:58:18.21 melted them just melted them on top of it it was delicious I think melted

00:58:22.11 cheese is better it does sound pretty good I feel like it's a good way to try

00:58:28.00 stuff because you've got a natural palate cleanse between every bite of 24

00:58:32.04 hours you do absolutely and it's just an exciting thing you wake up you get to

00:58:36.02 open a compartment you don't know what's in it it's great I think it's dumb that

00:58:40.16 they are only a December holiday thing I have one Emily made one for me it's a

00:58:44.20 house and it's just it's not cheese though it's candy but I get different

00:58:49.03 candies every day it's [ __ ] awesome that's very sweet

00:58:52.05 I do like oh I did some research online any website that recommends a build your

00:58:56.21 own go [ __ ] yourself go [ __ ] yourself like if you have

00:59:00.00 somebody who's willing to do it for you there's nothing more insulting than

00:59:03.19 trying to find a good advent calendar they're like make it yourself it's like

00:59:07.02 I [ __ ] I could buy a million of those why are you recommending this to me

00:59:12.13 I'm not like I I [ __ ] I hate it I hate it so you a big advent guy I love

00:59:16.18 I'm a big December guy I love everything about it I love the movies I love we've

00:59:21.10 talked about this the greatest stretch of the year is October through December

00:59:26.08 this is your favorite time of the year this is my favorite time of I'm gonna

00:59:29.18 get some Christmas lights later in the day oh it's going to be great

00:59:34.19 love new hair came out can I tell I knew halo what you said uh when the new halo

00:59:38.22 came out absolutely and then we could we'll see if Geoff is as annoyed as you

00:59:43.00 were by the statement I think it makes sense okay okay yesterday at the time of

00:59:46.23 this recording yesterday the halo infinite campaign came out and yeah I

00:59:51.07 hadn't I can't play it I hadn't seen any of it I was just I I avoid trailers I

00:59:56.08 avoid people's opinions I just want to go insane loving it um I feel like it's

01:00:01.12 I'm not going to talk about the game and I was talking to Andrew about the game

01:00:06.04 and he said this makes me want a new halo game

01:00:09.22 I said this game is so good I want a new halo game I believe on the day a new

01:00:14.19 halo game came out he was like man I wish there was another halo

01:00:18.20 see this is how left 4 dead 2 happened and everybody was all up in arms [ __ ]

01:00:22.13 all right I uh yeah I would love it if you guys I'm making a that's not

01:00:27.09 I'm gonna do my best not to play it what so I'm gonna try not to know

01:00:32.12 anything about it I'm waiting for co-op Milly and I had already planned I have

01:00:39.00 played every halo game at launch in co-op with the people that are most

01:00:44.08 important to me at the time and many from many of them were you kev

01:00:49.07 uh and yeah and uh I really really really was looking

01:00:54.00 forward to playing it with Millicent you know we we went through in preparation

01:00:58.12 played all the halo games together it became like a really sweet bonding thing

01:01:02.07 and so I don't want my first experience playing a new halo game with my daughter

01:01:07.13 uh or rather I want a first experience of

01:01:10.22 playing a new halo game with my daughter

01:01:13.01 and to have that yeah be new for both of us at the same time so I'm gonna wait

01:01:16.10 for this I'm gonna wait for the [ __ ]

01:01:18.19 co-op six months or whatever it's gonna be the hardest thing I've ever done

01:01:22.00 considering I have a career thanks to halo you know in many parts but

01:01:26.20 it is what it is I guess so now I will I

01:01:29.14 will expand on my comment without I feel spoiling anything

01:01:33.21 and we talked about it a little bit Geoff and I apologize if I spoiled anything

01:01:37.05 for you not at all I did you just you said you liked the grappling hook that's

01:01:40.06 fine I like the grappling hook is incredible but

01:01:43.10 when I played it when you play it when you hit I think it's the most innovative

01:01:47.05 halo game even though a lot of the things in part were in previous halos

01:01:52.12 they've never been combined in the way it is in this game and it took

01:01:56.04 like six years for this to release it was the longest gap between halo games

01:02:00.16 and it's one of those things where you know it was a development hell like it

01:02:03.21 was very widely reported that this was a [ __ ] mess of a game to make but it's

01:02:08.08 fantastic I don't want to wait six more years for

01:02:12.01 what the next step of this is like it's so great there's so many things I love

01:02:15.12 about it but there are also so many things you can see

01:02:18.11 where the next step of it will so clearly be an improvement on what they

01:02:22.01 have like they have the framework beautifully done but there's depth they

01:02:27.01 could add to the world and kind of the experience as a whole

01:02:30.00 that I think would make it genuinely one of my favorite games of all time and so

01:02:34.13 I'm excited about that and I want to be I wish I was in a space where halo

01:02:39.20 infinite was like halo 5

01:02:41.04 and I'm anticipating what will be what I think possibly my favorite halo game

01:02:45.22 ever made I can completely understand what you're saying there I feel like

01:02:50.00 halo reach was that for halo 3. Like I feel like it was an improvement in every

01:02:54.12 way not a reinvention but just like a refinement of what they had and then

01:02:58.15 odst and four were very different games in their own right and that's cool but

01:03:02.08 like I totally get what you're saying you want to see like the the next the

01:03:06.07 the iteratively improved iteratively improved version of what you just played

01:03:11.22 yeah exactly like in a way that they took such a step forward and it

01:03:15.12 feel like they have the framework to I feel like this game opens them up to

01:03:20.02 take it in so many different directions as far as the design goes in the future

01:03:24.15 and I'm so excited to see that evolution that I wish that there was a halo game

01:03:29.00 in development right now those people deserve like a huge break it's been a

01:03:32.12 nightmare to make it apparently and it's the holidays like they deserve time

01:03:36.15 realistically I want them to like relax and just enjoy themselves but for my own

01:03:41.12 selfishness I would be so excited to know that there is a halo game that is

01:03:45.23 expanding on what we currently have like two years in development and that it's

01:03:50.04 around the corner I'm so excited for it like halo infinite has brought back

01:03:55.10 a passion I have for the series as a whole that I didn't know I could regain

01:04:00.17 I love those games so much and it kind of I don't know I I fell out of that and

01:04:05.04 I'm so happy to be back in it and just so generally excited about halo I've

01:04:10.00 been having so much fun with infinite yeah I feel like I can't give

01:04:14.08 any opinions it's like the one area where I I can see that I am just a

01:04:18.07 fanboy of halo and when a halo game is good I I would give this game 10 out of

01:04:22.19 10 based on what I've seen so far I don't want to overhype it for people who

01:04:27.12 aren't into halo but I've yeah I'm gonna I'll post like a link to a clip

01:04:31.12 briefly I don't like I don't think this is necessarily the most interesting

01:04:34.21 thing I'd just like to see your reaction to it Geoff and I don't

01:04:38.10 feel like this is spoiler it's literally just me grappling hooks I'm using like

01:04:42.21 the grappling hook thing it's [ __ ]

01:04:46.15 crazy halo infinite is like a spider-man game

01:04:48.23 it is so much fun you said if you had a second grappling hook it would be the

01:04:54.08 best spider-man game ever made it is so much because I had to

01:04:57.09 the way that they design they can design the game now it's not flat in the same

01:05:01.11 way this is beautiful it looks beautiful and the movement of

01:05:05.16 it is so unlike any other halo experience like the other you could play

01:05:11.04 halo reach and there is some difference in the movement but it's fundamentally

01:05:14.15 kind of the levels are designed the same and you have the same limitations

01:05:18.07 and halo infinite I need to climb a mountain and I can just [ __ ] zip line

01:05:22.06 up it and it's fluid and it feels great dude you're it looks like you're

01:05:25.16 climbing out of Valhalla the Valhalla yeah it's [ __ ] awesome and the thing

01:05:29.13 that bungie always was really good at is

01:05:31.15 that if there was a piece of geometry in the distance

01:05:34.15 you could kind of always walk on it like a lot of games would just put in some

01:05:37.23 weird like translucent clipping through like background stuff if you found a way

01:05:42.08 of the map in the original halo games even if you weren't supposed to you

01:05:45.08 could actually walk out to all these places and now it's like available and

01:05:49.10 it's part of the game and it's amazing such a great example of it of like yeah

01:05:53.06 not only can you get there but you can get there and you might find a thing

01:05:56.13 there and there might be a mission and like that is so cool to me and it's not

01:06:01.00 the deepest those mechanics and those were the things was like wow with this

01:06:05.06 framework and expanding on this like adding more depth to just the world as a

01:06:08.23 whole I'm so excited for where halo will go

01:06:12.03 and I wish it was here already it's sort of the sentiment

01:06:15.10 the thing the thing that excites me about it just watching that clip and

01:06:20.00 uh just thinking about what I'm eventually gonna get to play it is the

01:06:23.20 best part of halo to me is after I've beaten the game five or six times and

01:06:27.16 you're just exploring and looking for easter eggs and you're just looking for

01:06:31.17 just weird [ __ ] and trying to break the map and trying to get trying to get

01:06:35.14 places where you're not supposed to and and just exploring just because

01:06:39.06 just because you want more of the world right like you just I walked around I've

01:06:42.14 watched halo so it's so many maps so much of my life has been spent walking

01:06:47.05 around halo looking for for sets and [ __ ] for red versus blue but also just

01:06:51.17 wanting to just spend five more minutes in the world and

01:06:54.23 see something new that I hadn't seen you

01:06:56.22 know and it looks like that is what this game is yeah it's like they've brought

01:07:01.13 the the attitude you take into like your

01:07:03.12 sixth play through and they've applied it

01:07:05.06 to your first play through like it's it's encouraged and it feels it feels great

01:07:10.13 just to piss off and walk around well I'm very excited to play it someday

01:07:14.17 we're a halo podcast I I would be fine hey we should uh when we go to Vancouver

01:07:20.11 uh sometime next year so that we can go crabbing

01:07:23.18 and uh do the bathtub race we should also plant a tree we should his name

01:07:28.19 absolutely I'd love to that's genuinely on my once I thought of that I was like

01:07:33.09 I need to plant a tree what tree would you go for that is uh um

01:07:37.18 apple tree what's the official face tree could you just plant a cosmic crisp

01:07:43.16 uh I guess I could theoretically I don't know if I would I didn't it was

01:07:48.18 unfortunate I discovered the greatest apple pairing of all time Geoff I

01:07:52.09 invented something as soon as we stopped recording let me tell you about the

01:07:56.15 cosmic lady take one bite of a cosmic crisp you take

01:08:00.07 one bite of a pink lady what a blend that's a great combo I'd highly

01:08:04.12 recommend anybody out there after you were saying that last week and and

01:08:09.02 was it was it someone here saying they didn't like peanut butter with apple me

01:08:13.12 yeah I feel like if I feel like that's uh peanut butter is

01:08:16.18 like it's a decent pairing and I didn't have it until I moved here but it's

01:08:19.16 pretty common from what I've seen yeah what if you took your four favorite

01:08:23.03 apples into quadrants and glued them together with peanut butter do you think

01:08:27.09 that would be the best apple of all time no

01:08:29.19 I hate I don't like the peanut butter like I don't understand that part of it

01:08:32.23 that's like you're like if you take four things you like

01:08:35.21 separately and then connect them all with the thing you don't like will that

01:08:39.03 be the best thing most people like that most people think

01:08:42.07 and if you're saying two apples in your mouth at the same time tastes really

01:08:45.09 good that could be the ultimate snack for oh I see it's like uh it's like your

01:08:51.08 glove but it's apples and peanut butter [Laughter]

01:08:55.01 oh nick says you could do caramel instead you could do caramel or honey or

01:09:00.11 something you could build Andrew you could construct the ultimate apple

01:09:06.17 I like this like the apple prime yeah yeah the infinity apple [Laughter]

01:09:12.04 yeah the infinity apple that's what you're making we should find which four

01:09:17.01 quadrants of four different apples make the ultimate mega apple the infiniti

01:09:22.01 apple the voltron of apples since we're an apple podcast I want it known we need

01:09:26.20 to mark December 9th we said we're going to do this last week I have a cosmic

01:09:30.10 crisp I'm putting it in my fridge and I will not touch it until one year from

01:09:34.08 now oh I gotta do that right now too uh [ __ ] let me go dude I'll be right back

01:09:39.03 are we gonna go put our apples in mine's on my desk at work

01:09:42.07 ugh Gavin are we gonna push another week till we no no no no no I'll just be a

01:09:46.08 week behind I'll just he will experience he will get to

01:09:48.21 witness us and then he will get to have the experience himself the following

01:09:52.09 week and he's committed to it so no matter how it turns out Gavin then needs

01:09:56.08 to try the apple a week after we do all right well I'll be right back I'm

01:09:59.22 gonna go put my apple in the fridge right now I can do that I'm gonna go in

01:10:03.16 tomorrow get my apple I open the fridge can I see my cheese thing from

01:10:08.20 I can't damn it it's the you know what's when I got the advent calendar I opened

01:10:14.10 I didn't realize so it has like you know one of those

01:10:16.20 pull strips on cardboard to like open yeah yeah I didn't notice it had one so

01:10:21.03 I just opened the bottom and I pulled it out and it was just this plastic piece

01:10:25.05 of cardboard with cheese sticking out of it and it was so ugly and I was like

01:10:29.16 there's no way that this is just what it

01:10:32.12 is and then I realized that the calendar part you have to pull the top and then

01:10:36.10 it opens inside to slide the cheese back

01:10:39.03 just at the weird guts of yeah I had the weird guts of the advent calendar and I

01:10:43.01 know somebody else who had it and I was paranoid that I put it in backwards and

01:10:46.21 I was eating 24 on day one and so you wanted to match up with the other

01:10:51.09 persons no I'd share the experience yeah

01:10:53.08 I was like oh man what was what was your what was the cheese you got on day one

01:10:56.21 like I just try to casually bring it up so I didn't say that I had to explain

01:11:01.16 they're like oh it's the same okay good I did it I didn't [ __ ] it up I'm not

01:11:06.19 eating backwards although that could be fun if you ate a

01:11:10.03 cheese calendar one way I ate it the other way meet up in the middle see what

01:11:14.04 we got talk about the experience exchange information what a journey

01:11:19.05 eating bad quiz eating back I did a I don't know if I should talk about this

01:11:24.02 people were not happy with me people got angry why not

01:11:27.22 I did a thing I did a food thing and this is a little old at this point but

01:11:33.00 I've been meaning to talk about it on the show um this is something you did

01:11:36.21 publicly people know about this is the thing I did publicly yeah I'll I'll just

01:11:41.03 I'll just post it here and I'm going to advise I'm going to be up front

01:11:45.12 the first thing I'm going to say was it it's delicious

01:11:48.23 the second thing I'm going to say I'm prepared to be disgusted no I don't think

01:11:55.01 uh uh the fur it's delicious don't do it that's gonna be my second thing

01:12:00.17 it's delicious oh right yeah people were mad at you they were mad they're mad at

01:12:06.04 me this is an invention I came up with heating marshmallows every okay okay

01:12:13.11 you'll just get it like wax is fuel so this is this is the thing you're

01:12:18.08 gonna be burning you might as well do it over a piece

01:12:22.19 so there is that can't be healthy well that's

01:12:25.20 that's yeah that was sort of my thought that was sort of my thought so this is

01:12:30.17 how it started I learned that there are devices that you can buy I say devices

01:12:34.21 like as [ __ ] advanced technology you can buy things to melt marshmallows

01:12:38.14 they're like metal they're shitty they're like 40 bucks and you can heat

01:12:42.07 marshmallows indoors with them and I was

01:12:44.15 like I don't really want to pay 40 bucks

01:12:47.05 for that but a melted marshmallow like a little bit burnt marshmallow oh it's

01:12:50.19 delicious so I was thinking how could I do this I had an apple on my desk I had

01:12:55.05 a fork and I had a candle I was like ah I wonder

01:12:57.14 if I can make this work so between halo games I would throw my my fork over the

01:13:02.21 candle and I'd get a nice cook going uh and yeah there's a lot of ways it's

01:13:08.12 pretty hot too oh the fork the fork would get hot it would be a problem

01:13:12.14 sometimes when removing the marshmallow from the fork at the base it wouldn't be

01:13:18.15 too much of an issue it'd take a while is that sitting on your scarlet that you

01:13:23.22 used to record this podcast with uh the the fork is yes with the apple the heat

01:13:28.12 the superheated fork no not transferring all that heat down to that device.

01:13:37.11 I've never roasted a marshmallow over a candle my friend and it shows it does

01:13:43.00 not get that hot Geoff that's the heat sink for his fork that's the heat sink

01:13:47.18 first yeah the heat's being dispersed into the scarlet no there's no

01:13:52.16 it's you don't have to worry about that it's just the point in which it's over

01:13:55.23 the direct flame the fork itself doesn't get that hot

01:13:59.02 do not do this uh for several reasons one as you brought up wax will get onto

01:14:04.10 the candle I never tasted it I believe this was a soy wax blend and also the

01:14:10.12 other issue is uh some some wicks are made with lead in them so do

01:14:15.03 not avoid generally I don't think it's a common practice I did not have mine was

01:14:20.10 a completely natural wick zero lead did you check that before though

01:14:25.14 oh no I had no idea that that was a thing I checked that after

01:14:29.18 how many marshmallow how many by the way nick says you might as well

01:14:34.08 be cooking this on a tire fire which I agree no it's not nearly that how many

01:14:39.14 marshmallows would you say extreme exaggeration

01:14:43.01 how many wax marshmallows with wax and lead marshmallows would you say you ate

01:14:48.02 three I had three marshmallows I had some guy came at me

01:14:50.23 of like this [ __ ] idiot's only gonna cook one side dummy you don't think I

01:14:55.16 flipped the fork over you think that this is just how it is wait how do you

01:14:59.05 get the same position with the fork on it oh you got to hold it at that point

01:15:03.12 at that point you're holding that or or you're like resting it on I don't I

01:15:08.02 think that it's something that was slightly taller than an apple that you

01:15:11.09 could try to I did attempt that and the banana slid into the it slid into the

01:15:16.23 candle okay I lost him lost him every single week this is what it's like

01:15:22.02 to to do a podcast with you lately uh well I didn't vanish though

01:15:26.21 you're quiet about it [Music]

01:15:29.01 oh yeah yeah we should probably wrap it up yeah I was actually thinking since uh

01:15:35.07 since Eric isn't here we might as well do like a responsible wrap up and like

01:15:40.04 an easy one uh because it'll frustrate him that he didn't get to participate in

01:15:45.11 it uh so uh uh andrew's not here anymore we suspect

01:15:49.03 we suspect honestly he might have burned

01:15:52.02 uh burned his apartment down with a with a candle and a fork and uh it's

01:15:58.21 s'mores I guess uh but I like the idea of him aggressively

01:16:05.01 saying no dummy of course I flipped my fork over yeah dummy oh my god I uh I.

01:16:15.18 I don't know I keep waiting for him to show back up because I don't actually

01:16:19.17 want to end it with him not here but he

01:16:22.02 doesn't seem to be so [ __ ] it what if we

01:16:26.00 end it right then he comes back and we don't tell him it ended oh I like that

01:16:31.12 thank you sorry thank you for listening to yet

01:16:35.14 another episode of the F**kFuckFacePodcast today we talked about a lot I'll leave

01:16:41.05 it up to uh to the capable mouth of minor league fan

01:16:44.14 jack to to perfectly surmise it in a different episode uh but we really

01:16:48.08 appreciate it and uh if you like the podcast if you wouldn't mind telling a

01:16:51.14 friend recommending it to somebody we would really appreciate it rooster teeth

01:16:55.06 uh this is our parent company the the the family umbrella as it were is a

01:16:59.00 company that was built on literally built on word of mouth and so uh it's

01:17:03.12 how we it's how we survive and it's how we fail as a company so if you would be

01:17:07.14 so kind as to spread the word we would certainly appreciate it thank you very

01:17:10.16 much we love you and we'll see you next time all right you know what I'd be

01:17:14.13 interested if if the comment leave us out they want to leave a comment uh

01:17:17.15 which episodes have you shown to other people to get them into this podcast

01:17:22.13 because I'd be interested to know which one you picked I yeah I would I would

01:17:26.10 like that as well like what is the best episode to introduce someone to Facebook

01:17:31.12 because I guarantee it's not episode one

01:17:33.07 no that's the thing it's not episode one and there's a lot of law that runs

01:17:37.07 throughout so it's like where do you where do you jump them in

01:17:40.18 where do you jump them in yeah it's confusing

01:17:51.16 so this is that was really unfortunate I you lost me and then I came back

01:17:57.14 relatively quickly and I heard your whole dumb plan of pretending the show's

01:18:02.12 still going on even though it ended I heard all that that wasn't a dumb plan

01:18:07.09 that was like it was a ridiculous plan what I forget

01:18:10.12 is whenever it loses me I need to leave the call to be able to speak again so I

01:18:15.09 was just waiting I was sweeping the bushes

01:18:17.09 I could hear everything I was listening to it all I was waiting for my time to

01:18:22.21 cut in and make my great line and uh nothing just I say it and nothing picks

01:18:26.18 up I didn't even say great line is this gonna be like says this where we pretend

01:18:30.18 that we end the podcast and then nothing I can't say a thing so then I need to

01:18:35.11 leave it's like I need to scream from the bushes that I'm in the bushes to

01:18:40.02 then re-enter the bushes and be like surprise

01:18:44.00 it ruined it hey do you guys think we should go uh we should do

01:18:47.14 I was thinking about this last week do you guys think sometime next year we

01:18:51.03 should do an apple picking event where we go to like a like an orchard and we

01:18:54.23 do like like when I do my apple trip I'm saying you guys want to go on an apple

01:18:58.00 trip with me next year I would love to go on an apple trip with you fall 2022.

01:19:03.02 You know I think that's a great [ __ ]

01:19:05.17 title I love that scrump 2022 put it on this and that brings up

01:19:10.06 that I realized the episode ended already

01:19:13.05 but that brings up a question I have do you think there is an etymological

01:19:18.12 connection between the word scrump or scrumping and scrumptious

01:19:22.14 what's scrumptious you've never heard the term scrumptious

01:19:27.07 no I've heard scrumptious scrumptious scrumptious however you want to say it

01:19:31.01 scrumptious do you think there's a I don't know it's Geoff I haven't heard

01:19:37.03 the word but maybe it's that character chitty bang bang truly scrumptious

01:19:41.21 scrumptious scrumptious scrumptious I'm saying how it's spelled I will say

01:19:46.17 it was so in the past Geoff we've had disagreements and you've cited things

01:19:52.01 like the dictionary to prove that you're

01:19:54.17 right and it is infuriating at times you had my back on irregardless having the

01:20:00.06 dictionary on your side is so much fun when you're on the other side of it

01:20:03.21 people are like that's such a [ __ ]

01:20:05.14 word just being able to be like hey you gotta go talk to the dictionary people

01:20:10.15 I'm just I'm saying it they backed it it's not my fight

01:20:14.10 I may even agree with you but it's there so I sent you a scrumptious of food

01:20:18.09 extremely tasty delicious a scrumptious chocolate tart where did you send it

01:20:23.18 oh is it not on the thing no where did you put it

01:20:28.01 it's not weird modify attachment okay just attach what do you need to attach oh

01:20:35.07 scrumptious extremely tasty delicious I wonder if like the root of it is like so

01:20:40.17 like like if it comes from like it's so good it

01:20:44.09 tastes stolen or something that's what I was about to say like how I'm talking

01:20:50.00 about that a coke is the best beverage in a snow scenario

01:20:54.10 does an apple that's stolen tastes better

01:20:56.20 yeah maybe yeah so it'd be like if uh if you got a lot of money that was stolen

01:21:02.16 you could be like oh it feels thiefly [Laughter]

01:21:07.03 it spins thiefly oh all right well should we made a really

01:21:13.22 long one that was a long episode Jesus is it really oh my god you're right it's

01:21:19.11 an hour and 20 minutes oh my god I gotta go get my kid god damn it I gotta go

01:21:30.14 not going to go to the wrong school
