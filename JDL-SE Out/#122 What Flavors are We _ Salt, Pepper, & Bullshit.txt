00:02:42.16 think it goes smoothly as well I bet it doesn't I it [ __ ] better go smoothly

00:02:49.03 all right uh okay next piece of house cleaning uh

00:02:54.23 when we ended the last episode we were very excited to jump into this one

00:02:59.21 because we were gonna hammer out the rules and get started on our alphabet

00:03:04.21 food challenge however uh and we'll get into this a little bit later as well

00:03:08.00 because we're supposed to be doing the monkey movie right now uh we're having

00:03:11.22 to do back-to-backs today so it would make no sense for us to

00:03:15.16 develop the rules and get it all squared away and then immediately go into

00:03:19.21 another recording where we can't talk about it so we'll handle all of that in

00:03:23.20 episode 123. I apologize I think you were probably expecting it in 122

00:03:27.15 because I'm pretty sure we we definitely said we'd start that it would 100 start

00:03:32.01 in uh episode 122 but just because of logistically I think it would be way it

00:03:36.06 would [ __ ] you guys and US way harder to figure it all out this week and then

00:03:39.19 have a whole episode that we we don't discuss it at all and then go into it so

00:03:44.11 we'll just skip any alphabet conversations uh and push those to the

00:03:48.13 recording that we're gonna do immediately after this one ends

00:03:51.12 everybody's okay with that all right yeah that's fine or so are we gonna

00:03:56.18 start then on the Monday on next Monday with that for us not them we'll we'll

00:04:02.00 discuss that next episode okay Andrew really wants it to happen in this

00:04:05.10 episode yeah I don't know the answer but

00:04:07.03 I know but I don't want to talk about it right now because I said a little bit

00:04:10.16 because there's there's no such thing as a question it you'll open the camera

00:04:14.16 worms it's a br it's brutal uh I just I'll you know we'll get into this next

00:04:18.14 episode too but I just had what I thought was a simple dinner were there

00:04:21.17 at the other night and it turned contentious quickly so uh oh wow I don't

00:04:25.10 even want to cover I don't want to cover

00:04:27.06 the alphabet what can we talk about this episode well I'll tell you the number

00:04:31.21 one thing I'd like to talk about is why we're not filming a goddamn monkey movie

00:04:36.13 again

00:04:38.14 this is so [ __ ] ludicrous how this I was trying to figure it out I think each

00:04:45.17 of us have now been responsible for for pushing the mvp2 recording at least

00:04:51.14 twice that was my first push I think I think that was a second what I'm not

00:04:57.03 sure about that Andrew definitely shoved it I did one no I did okay you know

00:05:02.13 Gavin I've done no I've done it once I've had one Shuffle I think everybody's

00:05:08.00 done it I think everybody's done it a hundred times Gavin you [ __ ] now

00:05:12.00 you're you're the reason we're not filming the monkey movie right now uh I

00:05:16.05 hope you enjoyed your vacation uh it was

00:05:17.23 lovely I realized that the uh the time I landed was exactly the time that monkey

00:05:23.03 lunch started or monkey move so I'd say British Airways 50 to play oh.

00:05:28.13 God damn dude so the current plan is that we filmed the monkey movie next

00:05:34.08 week I think is that right yes Friday the exact same time as now yeah

00:05:39.10 so it is on the calendar next Friday well that means nothing it was on the

00:05:44.14 calendar for this week too I 100 agree with you but it's still on the calendar

00:05:48.22 whatever I have to move something or if I'm gonna be late or miss a podcast.

00:05:53.04 Eric's like oh no problem sort out Eric's response this time was Jesus Christ

00:05:59.05 it's like I'm just I'm so disgusted by all of us uh I can't I have zero uh you

00:06:05.20 wanna talk about a bet let's place a bet

00:06:08.07 on whether we film the monkey movie next week or not how about that I I feel way

00:06:12.18 more no not way more I feel equally confident on both the sinks I also like

00:06:16.09 that you're you're leading this charge I

00:06:18.14 feel like you've pushed the monkey movie the most Geoff I think I have to but now

00:06:21.21 I'm telling you everybody has pushed the

00:06:23.17 monkey movie well I mean I agree totally I only pushed face I didn't push that's

00:06:28.08 true so I didn't think I could even take

00:06:30.05 all I did yesterday was land at the time we were recording face no you put you

00:06:35.23 pushed the monkey movie by virtue of you having to push face

00:06:41.02 yeah priorities it's it's absolutely Domino's and you set them off it's a

00:06:44.19 great way to put it Nick is changing opinions like the wind right now

00:06:49.15 that's true and then below it that's also true

00:06:54.19 well I will say that the monkey movie being pushed I think ultimately is a

00:06:59.23 good thing because it has given me more time how much time do you need for your.

00:07:05.06 PowerPoint this is what I'm gonna get into Gavin I

00:07:08.23 was always very much a leave the homework until the night before type of

00:07:14.07 guy and that is continued with MVP uh so

00:07:19.05 I've been starting I started it assuming we would be doing it today and I

00:07:25.02 realized I need way more time to do this right I could have put something

00:07:29.14 together but to make it truly right I needed more time I re-watched the entire

00:07:34.04 film I got my screen grabs I got everything kind of organized already how

00:07:38.20 many screen grabs would you two guess that I'm MVP one on my first anyway from.

00:07:43.13 MVP one to do this presentation I would guess and it's in let's say like 86

00:07:48.16 minute movie I would guess for a solid presentation at least 20.

00:07:52.21 At least 20. What about you Geoff God what's up it's either comically high

00:07:58.03 or comically low 20 feels like a pretty say I'm gonna say four you're gonna say

00:08:04.01 four yeah I'm gonna go the other way before we had a merch meeting yesterday

00:08:07.23 and before we started it I said to Eric I've captured way too many images on

00:08:12.12 this thing I probably have like a hundred so then I highlighted them all

00:08:17.08 to get a specific number I clicked and dragged I ended up with

00:08:21.19 227 screen captures for an 86 minute movie that's like half the frames we

00:08:27.09 talk about one episode like 20 seconds and it would be longer than the movie

00:08:32.21 that's I said to Eric at this point I just want

00:08:36.16 to do like one of those Stick man drawings where like you rapidly you like

00:08:41.14 spin it and it moves for you like you're just seeing a physical version of the

00:08:46.17 film uh I edited it down I reduced it I went through all of it last night I got

00:08:51.12 I got my kind of Final Cut I feel there might be one more minor at it how many

00:08:56.02 images do you think we ended up with with the final edit

00:09:00.10 12012050. Geoff is very close 144 we got 144 images to convey the story of.

00:09:07.11 MVP do you think that might be too long no I honestly I think I may have cut out

00:09:13.21 some some aspects of it it was also interesting because I did it in in

00:09:18.23 chronological order like I'd watch the movie and be like oh this is a plot

00:09:22.11 point I'm gonna capture this and then realizing like oh there's like three or

00:09:26.08 four storylines that they start and just

00:09:28.10 never finish they have no conclusions so like I don't need any of it we just

00:09:32.14 pretend it doesn't happen I think I don't cover two or three of the hockey

00:09:36.09 games it's uh I I cut where I could but there's there's a core to this story

00:09:42.07 that needs to be told so how long is your presentation gonna be do you think

00:09:45.19 oh I I don't I don't know I'm gonna try to keep it under 10 minutes would be my

00:09:51.06 boo okay and we're we're recording that as well right for release I believe so

00:09:56.19 yeah of the monkey lunch recording I assumed would be the presentation being

00:10:01.21 displayed that's great what are you guys gonna eat for lunch on monkey lunch no

00:10:08.07 that's tough because bananas obviously a go-to in that scenario but that's I

00:10:12.23 don't I don't do that I'm often honest I'm a little bit stopped up yeah what

00:10:17.13 happened I just kind of just not pooing really yeah but you but you just didn't

00:10:22.08 you just go on vacation outside of America don't you poo better outside of.

00:10:27.03 America I'll be honest right now right now I've got food from Italy England and

00:10:32.20 Texas in me at the same time oh God not super comfortable are you okay

00:10:37.21 outside of like are you dealing with is your stomach sore it doesn't feel like

00:10:42.15 someone's inflated a balloon in my gut but uh I fit that's definitely movement

00:10:46.18 like it's slowly working to working its way towards the doors have you attempted

00:10:51.20 to use the sleep apnea machine to fill yourself with air to maybe push

00:10:56.08 stuck through yeah almost like you're plungering yourself I would be genuinely

00:11:01.19 worried that my stomach would explode I I was gonna I was gonna go the

00:11:06.17 medicine route but I like I like Andrew's idea of repurposing everyday

00:11:11.20 items to solve this problem yeah I I made a mistake I've never felt

00:11:16.21 more human than I have this morning that is a mistake yeah doesn't happen often

00:11:23.01 my burger confidence was gone I don't think I've ever felt more like Icarus

00:11:28.02 than when you wake up with heartburn I like I woke up at 630 a.m I couldn't

00:11:33.04 sleep last night I was up a little bit later than I'd want to be and I was like

00:11:36.20 I'll have a little snack before bed so I had two or three pieces of garlic toast

00:11:41.17 there's some garlic bread it was great had a great time woke up at 630 feeling

00:11:47.10 like there was a volcano in my chest it was just terrible terrible heartburn no.

00:11:51.19 Tums no tombs nothing in sight nothing I could do to relieve it just sitting

00:11:57.06 there I've never felt more human my wings are seared my burger confidence

00:12:00.10 was gone it's terrible so you can feel human when both of your ankles are

00:12:05.08 snapped uh no that's just like an alternate form I guess I don't know

00:12:11.05 one eight of of the months of the year you're on the the injury report with an

00:12:16.06 ankle injury it's sort of just that's normal

00:12:19.13 that's I'd argue the months that I'm not hurt that's like I'm in super form that

00:12:24.10 is that is beyond that is another level of of burger confidence existed so

00:12:29.15 broken is the standard broken is the standard so what caused the heartburn

00:12:34.21 uh garlic bread garlic and some garlic bread okay and then immediately went to

00:12:38.10 sleep so garlic bread will do it to you huh I guess for me yeah I I didn't I

00:12:43.02 feel like that's something that has changed over time red wine gets me

00:12:47.15 really that's an interesting one yeah Gavin what do you can you look back to

00:12:51.16 one meal you think that stopped you up can you attribute like what do you think

00:12:54.19 what do you think did the worst damage to you uh I always get wrecked by.

00:12:59.20 Seafood so I'm gonna say it was the uh six giant king prawns I had oh that

00:13:04.20 sounds good can you make a condiment sauce to go with them because no I

00:13:10.22 didn't no I didn't okay foreign lemon's great Eric said peanut butter

00:13:15.17 peanut butter backs of Eric that yeah or is that stops you up it's heartburn

00:13:22.15 and only sometimes and I don't know why because I eat I'll eat peanut butter but

00:13:27.01 then there are times where I have peanut

00:13:28.19 butter otherwise and it's like oh no and I'm just like like completely in like

00:13:33.14 spitting acid could it be what you're pairing it with

00:13:36.20 or is it just the peanut no no it's like it's like a spoonful of peanut butter I

00:13:41.02 think it's interesting I I don't think I have a peanut allergy because I eat

00:13:44.12 peanut butter sometimes and it's fine I just think that there's just something

00:13:48.11 sometimes where something gets caught or

00:13:50.20 hits something wrong and all of a sudden

00:13:52.18 wow do you ever eat peanuts like Cracker Jacks or just like roast honey roasted

00:13:58.16 yeah when typically when you Take Me Out to the Ball Game uh yeah I will have

00:14:03.16 I'll have some peanuts but okay um other than that I think peanuts are pretty

00:14:09.09 bottom tier how whoa oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] now Geoff continue we need

00:14:13.23 to get into the uh he's right peanuts oh I know I'm right it's fine they're a

00:14:18.21 staple nut but they are like they're not a great nut a great 100 agree they're

00:14:24.06 they're that's are the are the the nut it's ignite

00:14:27.14 Geoff it might be the number one they're the number one they're the number one

00:14:31.23 nut in the world what yeah I don't think that's wrong but it's also not the best

00:14:36.22 taste you can you can coat them in so many different things it's a great base

00:14:40.16 nut yeah I just hope any other nut with any other thing I just bought you know

00:14:45.08 what you can't do with other nuts I just bought a bunch of peanuts to boil

00:14:49.08 yesterday I'm gonna boil peanuts this weekend oh that's disgusting yeah that

00:14:52.20 doesn't sound good yeah that's absolutely vile so delicious Gavin's had

00:14:56.16 actually pretty good pretty much good Geoff made him and they were great bit

00:15:00.12 weird boiled peanuts man it's a southern delicacy I'm open to it I don't think

00:15:04.23 there's anything wrong I think we would agree that peanuts are like the coke of

00:15:08.23 nuts like they're by far enough I just don't think that they're the best

00:15:13.02 tasting I think I didn't say that they were the best tasting that's what I

00:15:17.11 think we're clear that's the the issue I think we will say the best tasting nut

00:15:21.05 on three okay oh that's tough that's a tough

00:15:25.08 uh we'll do three two one go and I'll go ready okay okay three two one yeah oh

00:15:34.21 cashew is the worst nut wow yeah that's a terrible thing get [ __ ]

00:15:42.12 are you kidding me no I'm not getting anything macadamia nuts are way better

00:15:48.06 that's a great nut I think you're ridiculous can only cashew terrible nut

00:15:52.16 I was considering pistachio I love a pistachio the problem with pistachios is

00:15:57.06 you'll get one in like every I don't know 87 that is just awful that's rotten

00:16:02.10 that's the issue of pistachios that's not a lot of work it's like yeah that's

00:16:06.13 true well I mean you just buy them buy them at the store like uh I get like

00:16:10.11 spicy pistachios that are already like already shelled and they're [ __ ]

00:16:14.09 awesome huh uh I do I do agree with you though Andrew I feel like there has to

00:16:18.08 be like one pistachio in every bag or like bunch of pistachios that absorbs

00:16:22.14 all the bad in it and it just becomes like the doo-doo pistachio and it takes

00:16:25.17 all the bad flavor away from the others it's like the custard yeah we're

00:16:30.01 speaking of curses that's another thing we should talk about at some point today

00:16:33.22 um but listen I don't want to get I don't want to turn this into an

00:16:35.15 indictment of nuts I don't want to get into a whole nut fight I feel like we've

00:16:40.03 got so much other food stuff to be angry

00:16:43.05 at each other about uh or to argue about um but I I do have a question do you

00:16:46.11 guys talk about heartburn like you have it a lot is is heartburn a like a

00:16:50.02 relatively common thing for y'all no very rare for me I actually I remember

00:16:55.23 really wanting heartburn as a kid because then I could use Gaviscon

00:17:03.22 why why did I don't understand because of the name taste it's got my entire

00:17:09.21 name in it it's awesome yeah it's like I mean this is a realization I had at the

00:17:14.21 age of about six okay immediately I just don't understand I guess where my

00:17:20.11 disconnect is is why does using it make it cooler I feel like the fact that it

00:17:24.02 exists is the cool thing I think I just wanted to have some because there's a

00:17:27.11 medicine out there that if you take three letters away it says Gavin why

00:17:31.21 wouldn't I get it yeah take out the skull

00:17:34.15 I get it I just don't think that makes it cooler but I understand six-year-old

00:17:40.03 I probably would I used to live I used to have heartburn and acid reflux uh

00:17:44.23 every day of my life and uh yeah oh yeah yeah for for probably 15 years and then

00:17:49.11 I quit drinking and it went away and I don't know that I've had heartburn since

00:17:53.02 I quit drinking alcohol wow like yeah it was just something I knew and I knew

00:17:56.12 that was what it was like it was pretty hard not to not to understand what I was

00:18:00.14 doing uh but yeah I just like that's why I asked because I just I forgot about

00:18:05.01 heartburn until this conversation because it just hasn't been an issue

00:18:08.05 since I quit drinking wow that's awesome yeah sorry to hear you guys are still

00:18:12.13 plagued by it Eric's life there I think I'm all right

00:18:16.11 there you go javiscon have you ever had Gaviscon did that dream ever happen I

00:18:22.17 still don't think I'm about it let me let me ask you a question because

00:18:28.12 the you posted a picture of Gaviscon and it says it's mint flavored I assume

00:18:32.23 that's like the standard flavor what flavor would you attribute to Gathering

00:18:37.18 like if you had to pick a signature flavor for a cabin if you were a

00:18:42.04 medicine what for what flavor do you come in

00:18:45.10 all right are we all gonna make answers

00:18:50.08 in my head I don't know why this is I'm gonna have to decode this myself I

00:18:56.04 immediately went to some combination of like a fruit like a berry with black

00:19:01.21 licorice what's the flavor profile that I'm getting I think that's quite

00:19:07.19 flattering I'll say that yeah that is really good I like black licorice dude

00:19:12.11 I would take I would take you as medicine instantly somebody who raped

00:19:17.14 cashews the number one or the least number five I'm sorry yeah I'm sorry at

00:19:23.01 least number one if you get them on the airplane I'd [ __ ] throw those on the

00:19:27.14 floor dude the waste of a nut that's a waste of

00:19:31.10 itself just yeah that it's just a yeah it's a pointless

00:19:35.19 um how about you gav what what do you think you're mint flavored uh I don't

00:19:40.16 even know if I could answer I I don't know why I think I'm too close to it I I

00:19:46.21 think I think you're tomato based oh I could see that

00:19:50.23 that's interesting a tomato bait yeah I could see that yeah I would have said

00:19:55.22 maybe some sort of oil what type of oil like olive oil I see

00:20:01.19 that feels a little too fancy to me oh okay olive oil is extravagant iron stuff

00:20:07.16 Eric what flavor are you what flavor do I think I am organized no you what

00:20:12.23 flavor are you I think Gavin is that bubble gum flavor that you get see there

00:20:18.16 you go Nick Nick is saying that he's bubble gum I could see that too but I

00:20:22.13 think that I like I associate Gavin with

00:20:24.23 that bubble gum flavor that you get with like some medicines when you're a kid

00:20:28.21 um I think I'm like a NyQuil flavor like

00:20:31.08 you know when you take NyQuil and you go this is absolutely vile but boy it

00:20:35.17 really helps you out I feel like that's sort of like that's well maybe Nyquil

00:20:39.03 with an ashtray put in it

00:20:42.02 and someone been ashing their cigarettes in my Nyquil oh well I'm going to bed.

00:20:48.19 [Laughter]

00:20:52.23 Ashtray Michael oh man what about you Geoff oh uh I hadn't

00:21:02.10 thought about me oh you've got like a salt flavor to you I think I'm like my

00:21:07.11 wife just sorry I'm sorry I didn't mean to interrupt my wife just texted me and

00:21:12.16 said cinnamon so did you ask her what flavor you want no she's just in another

00:21:16.07 room and she just texted me.

00:21:19.17 I think I'm jalapeño flavored I think I'm like I'm spicy you know just like

00:21:26.04 some yeah generic spice like like yeah I could see that yeah like and like like

00:21:31.23 you like it at first but then you get too much of it quickly and then you

00:21:34.23 regret it I feel like that's me see I I think your jalapeño flavor or like when

00:21:39.01 something like a like a fast food restaurant goes like this is our new.

00:21:42.04 Spicy burger and then you eat it and you go this is not yeah spite this thing

00:21:46.20 thinks it's really spicy but this is not as spicy as it thinks that it is it's

00:21:51.12 like how people people outside of Texas think Chipotle has spice right but it's

00:21:55.18 like when you went to Nando's and got the spiciest.

00:22:03.07 I would say Andrew Andrew's flavor would be the plate at the end of a stack of

00:22:09.10 pancakes oh so like like maple maple-ish yeah like syrup flavor with

00:22:19.03 butter butter and stuck to it definitely butter how do you take your pancakes

00:22:25.20 Andrew uh typically just some butter just like a slice of butter on top and

00:22:30.19 just let it melt into the pancake when it's hot kind of thing yeah just a

00:22:34.03 little a little bit of butter on top so you're like a dry pancake person I guess

00:22:38.11 yeah well not I mean I need I need some butter on it can't be completely dry but

00:22:42.07 I think that's so gross my daughter does the same thing it drives me nuts I'm

00:22:45.23 just like it just it's syrup it's just like [ __ ] sugar man yeah it's a

00:22:51.04 moisture to it I don't understand you what are you like

00:22:53.23 syrup you need a lot of syrup on your pancakes yeah yeah well it's like butter

00:22:59.20 makes it wetter than syrup fruit or whatever oh that's an interesting

00:23:03.15 I don't think butter makes it wetter than syrup why would you no because it's

00:23:09.07 viscous it doesn't feel as wet as opposed to like clogged I also feel like

00:23:13.08 it exists I don't I don't know this could be wrong because I don't use Serve

00:23:17.00 frequently I feel like syrup kind of exists on top of the pancake and doesn't

00:23:21.03 integrate into the pancake like butter dust it's almost like they're two

00:23:24.14 separate entities that you're eating at the same time

00:23:28.07 I don't think they they mix syrup and a pancake I will say that

00:23:34.05 a butter goes further than syrup on a pancake like if you put a pat of butter

00:23:39.07 on it and then it like melts into the pancake you still you still get a lot of

00:23:43.03 the butter flavor but I feel like syrup you gotta constantly keep pouring it on

00:23:46.16 because it just like as soon as it like dissipates into the pancake it just like

00:23:50.19 the the flavor's lost it's like this where was Pancakes on your list Geoff on

00:23:55.19 my list of what oh it's not even on my list sorry

00:23:59.05 but now we're talking about pancakes what type of syrup do you like Geoff oh

00:24:04.08 uh I like Mrs butterworths or log cabin or like whatever I just like are those.

00:24:08.07 Maple are those Maples yeah okay I'll I'll take any kind of syrup any kind of

00:24:13.06 sugary syrup I don't care I'm not particular

00:24:15.17 they're they're to my knowledge there is no cashew uh of syrup they're all at a

00:24:20.20 certain they're all at a level above like this nut yeah yeah there's

00:24:25.21 definitely no standard for that got tons of great choices.

00:24:30.17 [Applause]

00:24:33.03 Now a word from our sponsor better help I've had times in my life where I've

00:24:38.07 been trying to problem solve so many different issues at once it just is

00:24:42.23 completely overwhelming to take on by yourself even things that you may

00:24:47.23 typically be able to sort through individually it can just be overwhelming

00:24:53.05 doing so many things and sometimes you just have issues that occur that you

00:24:57.06 can't seem to figure out a solution for it can be tough to train your brain to

00:29:32.05 was monkey movie right that was yeah all right oh my God that was monkey

00:29:38.02 movie uh the next thing we I have on my list is that we should mention uh that

00:29:44.02 we have a very special we're still formulating it but we have a very

00:29:48.17 special uh live stream coming up we have discussed it in the past uh I think the

00:29:54.12 audience at this point knows we're gonna be selling uh socks uh individually

00:29:59.18 cursed by Gavin uh at some point and so we're gonna we're gonna I think on

00:30:04.06 Halloween on Halloween day it's a Monday

00:30:07.19 October 31st I think the plan is to do a live stream where uh where Gavin curses

00:30:13.05 the socks live while we do some other Shenanigans and other stuff as well and

00:30:16.22 we have a really fun way to work Andrew into it that I I have been doing some

00:30:20.23 research on and I'm gonna try to build it here pretty soon uh this contraption

00:30:24.19 to include Andrew and that we're gonna have a cursed sock stream

00:30:28.18 it looks great like everything that we've talked about it I think is going

00:30:32.03 to be very funny some of it is covered in sausage talk which I don't know when

00:30:36.12 that will come out but that will provide more insight into all of these ideas

00:30:40.14 when does sausage talk come out I have no idea Nick said it should be out today

00:30:46.08 I'm just gonna say after but by the time this episode comes out

00:30:49.15 um it should be out right on the tail of it I think

00:30:53.00 um we could we can dial that in but it should be again you're listening to this

00:30:58.02 episode so it comes out next week uh for us recording right now okay cool

00:31:02.00 um Eric can we also talk about some of the other uh like because we had a

00:31:05.20 really good merch meeting yesterday and can we talk about like the plan for some

00:31:09.07 of that stuff or is it too early to get

00:31:11.00 people's hopes up oh [ __ ] I say just go for it why not all right so this holds

00:31:15.00 our feet to the fire so let's do it here's what I'm aware of that we have

00:31:20.04 coming out uh obviously the the curse socks I think will go on sale in at or

00:31:25.18 right after the spooky Halloween cursock live stream that going to do that I'm

00:31:30.00 very excited about I think the live stream might even be a countdown to

00:31:33.17 selling the socks because obviously we don't want to sell them until Gavin

00:31:37.08 curses them um and then I believe our big black

00:31:40.15 Friday item uh that I'm very I don't know why I I do know legs that's awesome

00:31:46.06 probably the the piece of merch I'm most excited about in the history of face is

00:31:51.14 uh the gerbler is going to come out on October 31st oh I'm sorry can't wait uh.

00:31:56.12 Black Black Friday Black Friday uh and I think we'll have a gurpler on hand

00:32:01.08 during the live stream on October 31st to show as like you know a sample then

00:32:06.14 on Cyber Monday not to be outdone by the gurpler on Black Friday Cyber Monday

00:32:11.06 you didn't think it could be real you couldn't imagine that we'd actually

00:32:15.04 make it but I have it on good authority that on.

00:32:18.22 Cyber Monday we will put the switch [ __ ]

00:32:21.17 up for sale so uh we actually got the switch [ __ ] made or it's being made as

00:32:26.08 we speak and they're gonna they're we're

00:32:28.06 gonna put it on sale Cyber Monday I hope

00:32:30.03 it doesn't fall flat on our face because

00:32:32.07 I will lose a lot of uh a lot of capital uh in the company if the switch [ __ ]

00:32:36.21 isn't uh isn't a success because that one took a little bit of convincing to

00:32:40.22 get made do we know how many switchflex have been made

00:32:44.13 that'd be interesting when they have no idea I think it was a few hundred but I

00:32:50.07 really don't I don't remember understood also you mentioned the uh the

00:32:55.11 grown tubes hadn't sold I guess that turned a lot of attention to it sold out

00:33:00.10 oh yeah I was told that the that maybe by the time that episode aired they'd

00:33:05.15 already sold out oh no [ __ ] that's the worst we suck at that but hey we're

00:33:09.12 letting people know a full what does this come out the 29th we're letting

00:33:13.15 people know two days and one day two days in advance about these baseballs so

00:33:17.20 you know they haven't we haven't put them on sale as of this recording so

00:33:21.15 that would that can't repeat um I think that's it there's discussion

00:33:25.07 about a baseball jersey coming out at some point I'm not really sure when

00:33:28.07 that'll be uh that's been kind of bounced around forever and I think

00:33:31.06 that's all we have kind of out there in The Ether right now that I'm aware of

00:33:34.11 we've been trying to get that vinyl of episode 16 made for about two years now

00:33:39.00 it feels like and that's still I don't know in The Ether somewhere

00:33:43.00 um am I missing anything I don't think so no I think that's I think that's the

00:33:48.10 bulk of it that was quite a good Roundup it was not to go too deeply into

00:33:52.06 self-promotion talk but I had kind of a funny thing happen relating to this show

00:33:57.23 uh in a sense the other night I watched the second episode does it do

00:34:03.03 which I had heard a lot about of Gavin's fall

00:34:05.08 and uh the things around it it was it was like a weekend I think it was

00:34:09.13 Saturday it was 2 A.M it was very light and I was like you know I'm gonna

00:34:13.04 finally watch this I just hadn't seen it yet for whatever reason and I was

00:34:16.23 excited to watch I laughed so goddamn hard at your fall Gavin mainly because I

00:34:21.23 knew yeah because I knew you were okay ultimately we had talked post fall and

00:34:28.06 that it was so self-inflicted that was entirely your fault and it didn't go the

00:34:32.22 way you wanted at all so I had a good I had a good laugh at it I was like man I

00:34:36.20 really want to watch that impact again so I I went back and I paused right when

00:34:42.06 you hit oh and I I died I died of laughter I was wheezing it's the hardest

00:34:50.05 I've laughed in a long time and I didn't

00:34:53.02 want to wake my partner up so I'm trying to like suppress it and I'm just I'm

00:34:58.12 just like like I'm just wheezing and it's I'm so

00:35:02.17 loud and I can't stop myself I I was crying there are tears coming down my

00:35:08.17 face I couldn't stop and I was I'm so sorry I'm trying to be quiet but just

00:35:13.15 from looking at this paused oh just looking I I genuinely laughed without

00:35:18.23 pause for probably 80 Seconds I couldn't stop and then I gathered myself and you

00:35:24.15 I mean just look at the photo it looks like all of your bones are escaping

00:35:30.03 through like a magic trap door on the floor like everything is leaving

00:35:33.19 everything is gone so then I I unpauseed it for a second and then re-paused it

00:35:39.01 and I got this angle and then I just did started all over again and I couldn't

00:35:45.06 there is no muffling that oh my goodness stop laughing you got like an ET arm

00:35:50.10 you're just you're destroyed you have wrecked your body in the least

00:35:55.11 entertaining way visually I've ever seen there's nothing impressive it was such

00:36:01.22 you would you did so much damage and nothing about it looked cool or funny

00:36:07.00 and you did it yourself and that's what I think really got me just I remember

00:36:11.07 that when I go to try and push someone or talk with someone all I do is bounce

00:36:15.20 off it's all I've ever done my entire life I just gotta come to terms with it

00:36:21.00 the next day I said I'm so sorry I probably woke you up I couldn't this I

00:36:25.01 was looking again falling and uh they were like they said yeah I couldn't tell

00:36:30.19 if you were laughing or crying like it's like genuinely extremely upset and once

00:36:36.00 I I noticed that it was laughter that I was like that's fine but oh I was a mess

00:36:41.12 oh it was such a good laugh maybe my biggest laugh of the Year oh oh I

00:36:46.03 thought it wasn't being recorded oh it's

00:36:48.22 great uh it's a great time Eric speaking of does it do when do we get to make

00:36:55.01 more of it we only made of October in the Box oh my God yeah I just had a I

00:36:59.07 just had a conversation with someone to make sure that we have space and time in

00:37:03.06 the uh studio so end of October is what we're looking at but before the sock

00:37:07.07 cursing before the saw cursing yes okay okay it'll just have to be a couple

00:37:11.05 weeks into October so we can't get Studio before that so it'll probably

00:37:15.12 it'll probably come out like episodes three through eight I think is it is

00:37:19.12 we'll come out in no November and December then probably yeah I would

00:37:22.08 think November December kind of like round out the year with uh hopefully

00:37:27.05 Gavin not breaking anything but you know yeah I gotta say I I'm really bummed

00:37:32.23 about the incredibly long break between uh releases but I'm really excited about

00:37:38.04 recording these next six because I think we figured a lot out in the first two

00:37:41.19 episodes and then not to get into the sausage talk but then we had and I think

00:37:45.07 we covered this in sausage talk even we had a really good meeting where we came

00:37:48.11 up with a lot of really good ideas and I

00:37:50.04 think we'll be a lot more prepared and I think because of that there'll be a lot

00:37:54.06 punchier episodes three through yeah I agree uh not that the first two were bad

00:37:58.15 I thought they were great but just knowing I've been excited to see what's

00:38:03.16 coming with the outline that we have would you ever be in one Andrew yeah I'd

00:38:07.23 be in one I'd have to if I was I was in the country yeah I'd gladly be him

00:38:12.01 absolutely I think I would want to bring my own product though I know that's a

00:38:16.11 weird demand I feel like I'd want to surprise you guys with something oh I

00:38:20.13 like that idea I love it I don't know what that is yet you won't come to.

00:38:24.03 America until November I would not be an American until Easter should I be not

00:38:28.23 making any plans for November why would you make plans for November well I'm

00:38:33.06 saying if Andrea is potentially coming I

00:38:36.03 never said I'd be in America in November oh I was open to being in America as of

00:38:42.04 November weren't we all gonna maybe secretly go to Vegas in November and and

00:38:47.07 just hang out you're gonna originally so there's a plan for Vegas and then that

00:38:53.00 fell through due to no fault of my own there was a discussion that you guys

00:38:56.14 would come here in November and then there was also talks of Vegas in

00:39:00.16 November as well there have been all sorts of November talks we should

00:39:04.02 solidify something I would I would like us all to breathe the same air in

00:39:07.21 November of humanly possible yeah I like that idea a lot I don't think you do

00:39:11.06 because you didn't say that you would you were really up for going in November

00:39:15.15 you just wouldn't go before November I just said I like the idea though I just

00:39:20.08 don't believe it previous statements okay that's fine I'm not gonna [ __ ]

00:39:24.05 try to change my beliefs to some goddamn I don't even remember what you said you

00:39:28.06 tasted like at this point never mind but I'm not gonna argue over that you

00:39:32.04 know I'd like to change my answer I don't think it's a tomato based

00:39:35.14 [ __ ] I'm not gonna go into a debate war with I think he tastes like

00:39:41.01 prawns Gavin oh really maybe like cocktail sauce yeah

00:39:45.04 um but he calls it something else maybe like a cocktail sauce that isn't a

00:39:50.10 called a cocktail sauce but actually is just a cocktail sauce interesting

00:39:56.02 potentially okay I like cocktail sauce you definitely taste like a condiment

00:40:00.02 though [Laughter]

00:40:03.00 tots uh uh I don't know why we need to ruin today with that talk

00:40:09.16 uh the next thing I have on my list if we want to keep keep the ball rolling

00:40:14.20 because we're running is uh moving along uh

00:40:20.10 I have a uh I have right here uh this is I think a teeing up You Gavin I just

00:40:26.03 have Eric hypocrite written down and I don't know why it's just held over from

00:40:30.10 last time you were gonna play a video audio or something oh yeah I didn't get

00:40:35.11 that audio yet wow great great word all right well we'll push Eric hypocrite

00:40:40.23 till episode it would involve listening to face Jam

00:40:44.12 which I haven't brought myself to be able to do yet but

00:40:49.01 yeah right on thanks man

00:40:52.05 uh I will say we can just go base we can just confront him based on the comments

00:40:58.08 okay this is yours this is your show man this is yeah you're running this yeah

00:41:01.23 maybe Eric can pluck out what he was talking about a lot of people in the

00:41:04.22 comments Eric saying that you you pretty

00:41:08.04 much went down the route of extra medium uh understood in a range of day in a

00:41:12.20 range of days in a month yeah uh in a range of days there's a beginning

00:41:15.22 there's a middle and there's an end and you have a range within them Gavin when

00:41:21.17 you go to store.reasterteeth.com um and uh you click on a random shirt

00:41:26.00 here's one easy allies weakling t-shirt on the front page just scroll down oh

00:41:30.17 they have extra small small medium they have all the sizes up to 4X incredible

00:41:35.05 that's great oh I wonder what sizes they are

00:41:38.10 um oh looking here there's one number here for medium

00:41:42.17 okay that's interesting so it's not a range so it is just a single number and

00:41:46.18 in order for something to be arranged like a range of days there would have to

00:41:50.13 be multiple days to choose from but what I'm looking at is just a single number

00:41:55.18 that says chess 20 inches um I mean that's that's range within an

00:42:01.05 inch you're you're saying that what you asked me for when you asked for an extra

00:42:07.18 medium was getting down to quarter inches

00:42:11.09 uh if there's no range Eric the next for

00:42:15.06 medium would be 20. No that's me you got me blah blah

00:42:20.07 yeah because you wanted something

00:42:23.17 so what were you saying about the dates that so the beginning of the month is

00:42:28.23 like the first or the 10th the middle of the month is like the 11th through the

00:42:32.07 20th and the end of the month is like the 21st through the 30th or the 31st

00:42:37.12 however that sort of it ranges out because there's a range of dates there

00:42:43.15 and the 15th would be medium 20 inches medium 20 inch one number looking at one

00:42:49.02 number here that's just awesome that's that has been ranges within medium there

00:42:55.00 has been ranges within medium well that's what Tony said there has been

00:42:58.18 ranges within medium when I'm I'm on our story but what you've proven with the

00:43:03.14 date thing is that you've you uh you deep at a deep level at core level

00:43:08.04 stand the concept of extra media no no I understand the concept of ranges

00:43:13.21 yeah and what you're expressing is not the most medium which doesn't exist

00:43:19.15 because it's not arranged what you've what you've asked for

00:43:24.22 it's a size is this the fifth time we've had this argument I think it's

00:43:30.10 I'm not having the argument I'm just I'm

00:43:33.12 simply stating a fact and you're arguing

00:43:36.17 and so I mean that's just sort of how it goes it's really incredible how many

00:43:39.18 people have come out it's great I was talking to Geoff about this the other

00:43:43.03 night at dinner um oh yeah let's talk about this dinner

00:43:46.22 we'll get into it next episode there you

00:43:49.19 go the the thing the thing I really like is the hubris of people making topics

00:43:56.01 going I'm here to settle the debate and then they have an opinion and then it's

00:43:59.13 88 comments

00:44:02.04 the one the ideal the idea that they're sitting at home going guys I've got just

00:44:09.06 the thing that's gonna get everyone on the same page and it doesn't buy a mine.

00:44:18.09 I think that's been my favorite part of the whole thing that and being right

00:44:24.03 have been my favorite parts of the whole thing

00:44:27.06 can I ask you a hard-hitting question Gavin yeah what does extra medium taste

00:44:33.00 like

00:44:34.13 um pepper it tastes like salt [Applause]

00:44:38.18 [Music]

00:44:39.22 Somewhere between salt pepper and [ __ ] one of one of those three things

00:44:45.00 should be salt pepper and [ __ ]

00:44:47.23 [Laughter]

00:44:52.05 Oh I am so mystified that extra medium has

00:44:59.01 has had the life that it's had like we were discussing this the other day uh

00:45:05.10 it feels like next to the comment lever versus regulation listener discussion

00:45:11.21 probably the most disgust thing in the history of face at this point yeah yeah

00:45:17.14 and we talk about that in uh sausage talk oh yeah I guess we do well it's

00:45:21.22 continued it's gotten even like crazier and I still I like you know you want to

00:45:27.02 find like funny ways to to turn the bit into I don't know I don't know some

00:45:31.04 silly piece of merger like some way to to to to to elevate this but I for the

00:45:36.09 life of me can't figure out how to turn extra medium into something that people

00:45:40.05 would want to own well I don't think we have to yeah I don't think we have I

00:45:44.04 guess we won't then yeah I mean it's in the store now I guess that I guess

00:45:47.20 they're getting every time every time they buy an extra medium shirt they're

00:45:51.16 buying an extra medium fish shirt yeah and I think on the on the actual shirts

00:45:54.19 they'll be printed that way eventually that's yeah we should do what happens

00:45:59.18 insane insane [Music]

00:46:02.03 I have a travel story hold on a second I'm taking Eric hypocrite off is that

00:46:06.13 right thanks man yeah you can go ahead and erase that thanks boss what's your

00:46:10.05 travel story Gap uh is your list done yeah well I mean I got I I just have

00:46:14.15 pastrami but we can get into that whatever oh no that's way more important

00:46:18.06 no yeah no no no well we'll end on pastrami tell your travel story okay all

00:46:22.03 right I was in the airport a little family vacation talking grandparents

00:46:26.07 siblings cousins the lot got everyone going back to where we're all from in

00:46:31.06 Italy and um we're just waiting to board the plane and

00:46:35.11 someone is talking I'm not gonna mention

00:46:37.21 who this is because I don't want to like say exactly who is responsible for the

00:46:42.01 story someone in my family talking to me about House of the Dragon oh yeah it's

00:46:45.19 pretty good they were like oh yeah I really like the main guy I was like oh

00:46:49.00 yeah Paddy uh Paddy concert in I like that guy he's been a lot of stuff but he

00:46:53.21 had been like born ultimatum and uh great and Hot Fuzz is one of the Andes

00:46:58.18 uh The World's End all that all that all

00:47:01.13 the egg right stuff I [ __ ] you not over

00:47:03.13 almost 30 seconds after I just said that Edgar Wright the director of Hot Fuzz

00:47:07.01 and uh the World's End and Sean of the dead and all that all that good stuff

00:47:10.16 that I love just strolled through the uh

00:47:14.07 little boarding area for this flight and

00:47:17.05 sat down and I was like Jesus Christ but I was like oh God

00:47:19.16 it's freaking Edgar Wright that's amazing and I didn't want to go up to

00:47:22.21 him and say hi or anything because you know he's traveling he's probably

00:47:26.14 working didn't want to be weird and annoying were you in America England or

00:47:30.22 Italy at this time this was in England okay this is a Heathrow Airport all

00:47:35.05 right thanks sorry I didn't I just didn't I didn't want to make a fool of

00:47:38.06 myself uh but I was kind of amazed that that just happened and then I kept

00:47:42.12 getting put in situations where I ended up like right next to him and I was like

00:47:45.19 oh this would actually be a great opportunity to be like oh you know a big

00:47:49.12 fan and all that I haven't worked on hot

00:47:51.14 fuss for a day could have said that he's used Phantoms I use Phantom I'm sure we

00:47:55.23 could have had a decent conversation but

00:47:58.04 I didn't want to do it the family member one of the family of episodes with is

00:48:02.11 potty training their kid um and they're trying to get them to go

00:48:06.04 to the bog in real bogs and uh not piss a nappy so they got this little like

00:48:10.03 travel potty thing that folds out on the floor

00:48:13.06 and for like for that last hour they're trying to get him to pee in this thing

00:48:17.02 trying to like sneak him into a corner but he just wouldn't go in it and then

00:48:20.20 right as we boarded the plane he was able to successfully pee in this little

00:48:26.10 pie got on the plane um I was I was probably in row like 14 or something

00:48:31.21 Edgar went further back he sort of sat around the area with my family back

00:48:37.03 there uh we get off the plane and I end up right next to Edgar right again on

00:48:40.23 where we get bust to the airport you're going to and it's I want to say the

00:48:44.09 exact airport that it would be on a dox's trip but we're on the bus he was a

00:48:49.21 little bit behind me and then the doors to the bus opened except my door got

00:48:53.06 stuck shut so he was in the line of people going out the door that opened

00:48:57.05 and by the time he got to me I'd just been letting people off because I

00:49:00.08 couldn't get through my broken door and he got to me and was like oh yeah you

00:49:04.16 you go next you've been waited ages I was like oh he's a really nice guy

00:49:07.15 that's great oh I really want to talk to him I didn't do it and then I met her

00:49:12.02 with my family member who has a kid who said uh had an absolute Nightmare on the

00:49:16.11 plane absolute nightmare I was like oh laughing like well uh we got the kid to

00:49:22.16 uh pee in the in the party but we have time to empty it and it was like this

00:49:28.05 little sealed plastic potty that you can like strap shut and they

00:49:32.15 were like oh we're on the plane and uh realized that pressure has a huge impact

00:49:38.11 on sealed containers they put it in the overhead bin

00:49:43.12 and all the piss had shot out the potty I'd slid all the way down the overhead

00:49:49.05 bin and was Dripping on basically one entire side of the plane in the back of

00:49:54.10 the plane but I was like oh [ __ ] I'm sorry did you

00:49:58.12 did he piss on that guy's head apparently a bunch of people was landing

00:50:03.09 on like their backs and stuff oh no no but um I couldn't get them to I they

00:50:08.10 didn't really notice edgaray or know what he looked like so

00:50:12.22 I don't know there's a very uh there's a very high possibility

00:50:16.05 that one of my family members two-year-old family members is pissed on

00:50:20.05 at Great's head I really hope he wasn't sat below that because I think by the

00:50:23.13 sounds of it went on about five different people's shoulders

00:50:27.11 Anna if Edgar if you're listening I hope that I hope you knew nothing of that

00:50:33.14 um and I'm a big fan sorry if that happened on behalf of my family

00:50:43.00 we are

00:50:46.11 directors

00:50:50.10 that's director number two they're potentially in our bad books

00:51:00.14 then we're traveling we got in a cab and we're traveling up this mountain path

00:51:05.18 where we were going it's basically on the top of the it's like hundreds of

00:51:11.10 feet above sea level and uh I'm sat in the little mini cab and all I hear

00:51:17.01 coming from the back seat is

00:51:19.21 and I'm like yelling to the family member again I'm like by the way after

00:51:24.17 all this piss exploded at the top of the

00:51:27.16 plane did you empty it and I'm like well

00:51:29.10 you know it mostly got emptied uh what's wrong with your family what is wrong it

00:51:35.02 was still spewing out in the back of the minicab all over all the luggage as we

00:51:40.13 were like slowly driving up it was kind of like spurred I was like get this

00:51:45.11 [ __ ] of it get the pee away from us what are they doing

00:51:50.05 in that toilet that little mini party got pressurized twice.

00:51:55.22 [Music]

00:51:57.12 Damn it I mean this respectfully those people suck they stink what are they

00:52:03.09 doing like I understand but they didn't have

00:52:06.17 kids no if your kid pisses in his party they're potty training if he's going to

00:52:12.08 the party and they don't have time to empty it and they're boarding a plane

00:52:17.04 what are you gonna do oh yeah are there no [ __ ] toilets on the plane

00:52:22.08 to do is that we'll get this plate of the air and then dump the pee out oh no

00:52:27.07 you don't there's no way you just you you tell somebody everybody is okay with

00:52:33.00 you emptying the piss [ __ ] toilet thing you just say hey this is filled

00:52:37.21 with pee can I drain this real quick I crazy as someone who successfully

00:52:43.04 potty trained a kid uh in this case my daughter uh I can confidently say I

00:52:48.20 never got her piss or [ __ ] on anyone like that I gotta go with Andrew that

00:52:53.07 your family who I I love dearly especially your grandparents and your

00:52:56.22 mom I think I just I think the world of them but the rest of your family if it

00:53:00.22 wasn't those three are disgusting just yeah apparently when it started dripping

00:53:05.15 on everyone everyone was like making a fuss and like get it up and then the

00:53:09.16 flight attendant came over and was like uh whose container is this

00:53:14.23 and my family was like oh that size because it opened and uh the flight

00:53:20.06 attendant was like yep what's in it oh and my family member was like you're

00:53:25.06 not gonna like this but it's pink

00:53:33.09 clothing I think uh half my family was dying from embarrassment oh my God I

00:53:39.14 couldn't believe that like I don't know what I would have done if I was in that

00:53:45.10 position I think I would have just had to curl up

00:53:48.22 I I couldn't handle that level of embarrassment I I don't yeah I don't I don't

00:53:54.07 understand there's so many things you know I don't

00:53:57.04 it's not even that those family members are gross they're just completely

00:54:01.19 incompetent right that's I don't understand that is any of the choices

00:54:05.16 dictionary definition of inept like yes that just like the icing on the cake is

00:54:11.10 that they still carried the piss around with them to the cat that's right like

00:54:14.19 at Double point do you like get this thing as far the [ __ ] away from me and

00:54:20.07 my family as possible I would put so much this distance between myself and

00:54:24.07 that child toilet like oh my god dude that would be like all right well lesson

00:54:29.08 learned here this is not a travel time oh do it twice at sea level

00:54:35.01 you know what no you're right you're right Geoff this has changed my opinion

00:54:39.03 the first time incompetence the second time psychotic psychotic this is this is

00:54:44.15 a lot expected it to happen on on the ground they didn't expect it to happen

00:54:49.00 once once it's already happened when you didn't expect it it's yeah all rules go

00:54:54.07 out the window you can no longer trust your read on the situation I think you

00:54:57.22 are an incredibly decent human being uh one of the best uh in my life and I

00:55:02.21 think you must have sapped all of that out of your family like you must have

00:55:08.00 taken all the good conscientious polite all of that element of your British.

00:55:13.14 Society you got it all and you just you left them with just like American ethics

00:55:19.12 and morals oh man and I would say I would say Edgar Wright is my favorite

00:55:24.20 director well I wouldn't say that right now if I were you after you after your

00:55:29.00 family just pissed all over him I really hope it didn't go on him

00:55:33.05 I need to know you know what my favorite

00:55:35.15 part of that story is I am no longer the

00:55:39.03 definitive piss boy of this podcast that is that the title has been claimed

00:55:44.17 that's gone that's done for me I can't have that

00:55:48.19 yeah he's right two-year-old has that that's that's off my record now

00:55:54.07 it's a great day for me congratulations thank you I will say

00:55:59.03 I was gonna mention this earlier when I asked you what country you were in at

00:56:05.17 the time uh because I thought it was uh but then the story just kept going and

00:56:10.17 kept going and kept going but uh I will say there's a there's because Edgar

00:56:13.19 Wright is British you're British right yeah and this happened in England

00:56:18.13 irrespective of you of your family dousing Edgar Wright in urine uh

00:56:24.11 it's we should test this next time you or we are in England you might have like

00:56:30.06 on home soil you might have enough like gravitas or success or whatever it is

00:56:35.10 you might be able to summon certain celebrities to you

00:56:38.03 this could be a skill you have there's nothing I want more in the world than to

00:56:42.17 be in a place with Gavin and Edgar Wright and to be able to reveal that hey

00:56:48.07 remember that time you got pissed on on that plane he's kind of responsible this

00:56:52.14 guy right here do you blood Road do you know do you know anybody who knows Edgar

00:56:57.04 Wright like does Buckley or anybody know

00:56:59.05 Edgar Wright that could find out hey did

00:57:02.12 you get pissed on on a plane recently no I mean I damn I'm sure yeah do that

00:57:06.20 hey I'm just wondering if a member of my family may have peed on you recently oh

00:57:12.03 please please we need to know we need definitive

00:57:16.03 answers an attempt needs to be made I I could not have been more embarrassed.

00:57:23.14 Through Blood it was I just because as as I was being told the story I was like

00:57:30.12 oh no I know and then I was just like oh no

00:57:35.22 oh god oh that's so good was Meg around for this she was sat with me she heard

00:57:43.00 about the story afterwards I would love to I gotta go to dinner with y'all soon

00:57:47.12 so I can hear her side of this oh man I bet her her insights are going to be

00:57:51.22 fantastic I can't wait [Laughter]

00:57:54.21 oh I'm tired after listening to that story

00:57:58.17 um that wore me out I'm so happy Gavin that's oh my God you guys realize this

00:58:03.18 is gonna be the next we've already I think I identified him but this will be

00:58:07.18 season two of face animated right regulation animation oh absolutely 100

00:58:12.07 peeing out Edgar right it was it's hearing the story because I had the

00:58:16.08 story in the airport and we're all sort of still in the airport but I was still

00:58:20.04 weighing up like I'm not gonna have am I gonna like work up the confidence to

00:58:23.14 just say hi tech you're right and after I had that store I was like I'm gonna

00:58:28.17 let Edgar Wright leave and I hope we don't cross paths in this way ever

00:58:33.01 again oh that is brilliant that might be

00:58:35.21 the best story ever told on this podcast Kevin that was a great story I don't

00:58:39.19 think it was the best but it was it was significant I don't know dude it's up

00:58:43.15 there for sure I agree with Nick it's up there I was I had just put at about for

00:58:49.08 about five solid minutes I just had to have my I just put my head down on my

00:58:52.22 table and just giggled into my arms and was useless I couldn't do anything but

00:58:58.21 laugh uncontrollably oh I'll be honest I'm excited I don't want

00:59:03.07 to tell sorry what are you excited about Andrew I was gonna say I'm excited

00:59:06.17 because I feel like we're all happy right now and based off of what you said

00:59:09.16 the next episode is going to be very contentious I'm trying to live in this

00:59:12.21 moment yeah yeah maybe we should live in let me Revel in this moment what I was

00:59:17.18 going to say is I'll be honest I think my pastrami story is going to be a huge

00:59:21.05 letdown after that so I don't know

00:59:23.17 what that was kind of mean Gavin you should have closed with that you

00:59:29.10 should have let me try I just should have he tried I figured next next time

00:59:33.16 would be all about the food challenge that's fair do we want to do pastrami to

00:59:38.02 open I'll open we'll open with pastrami it's a really it's a non of it I mean

00:59:43.11 next to that I'm excited I have questions okay I feel like this opens

00:59:46.14 all sorts of doors for you food wise I need information thank you for listening
