00:00:19.09 [Music]

00:00:26.06 [Music]

00:00:33.18 I don't like the search what I'm looking up stuff about things

00:00:40.00 you missed the whole thing what the [ __ ] is that you missed the

00:00:44.08 whole thing there was a whole argument at the end of uh

00:00:47.13 well yeah I guess last episode it'd be fair to say the end of it after it left

00:00:51.14 yes there's a brief argument that uh I had to do some research on what was the

00:00:55.23 argument I I guess we should save it do I bring it up now I guess we're

00:00:59.16 recording Gavin will be here in a minute it's

00:01:02.04 about taste buds what about them we had a little bit of an argument about taste

00:01:06.13 buds and their possible locations where they can be in the body they're on your

00:01:11.03 tongue they're on your tongue I said that they were also in your ass and

00:01:14.06 that's why you felt spicy thanks.

00:01:17.01 I will say and Gavin will have to corroborate this there was a bit on the

00:01:20.22 how oh I guess Eric would know there was a bid on the Howard stern years ago

00:01:24.03 where Richard christie was able to correctly identify flavors of beer

00:01:28.06 poured into his ass five out of six times I don't think that was to do with any

00:01:33.11 taste bud though I just assumed that was sort of the feel

00:01:36.13 and maybe the aroma what do you mean the feel the anal feel of beer what do you

00:01:41.16 mean well you've got nerves okay but you don't I don't think I could

00:01:45.21 tell the feel if it was in my mouth if you pour me like seven different

00:01:49.17 types of drinks liquids liquid it's yeah it's liquid you can just you can tell

00:01:55.18 like carbonation or viscosity through your mouth I get but I that's not like

00:02:00.15 taste taste would be the factor not feel

00:02:03.00 I bet you all liquids feel the same yeah I'm kind of with Andrew on that I mean

00:02:07.12 maybe not identical but I don't think six beers feel

00:02:10.21 different enough to tell from with your butthole maybe you could tell the

00:02:14.07 difference between like motor oil and uh

00:02:16.19 like Pepsi or something but I don't know that you could tell the difference from

00:02:19.22 beer to beer yeah well how come you don't taste taste a poo coming out there

00:02:24.05 oh that's a [ __ I uh I don't like that well you're the one

00:02:27.02 who said you got taste buddy that's what

00:02:30.08 I thought that's what I heard so I I did some research

00:02:33.20 from what do you mean I don't know where do you learn anything I can't source

00:02:37.13 most of the stuff I've learned where did you learn well no that was

00:02:41.23 gonna be a real dumb one wow I'm glad I glad I cut myself that was that gonna be

00:02:47.02 no don't worry about it we're good but I did some googles I did some go ogling

00:02:52.01 and I found out there are not taste buds in your ass that was that was wrong but

00:02:56.06 I was directionally correct [Laughter]

00:02:59.02 there are taste receptors in your ass as

00:03:01.09 well as all over your body you got taste receptors all over the place I think

00:03:05.00 they're in your balls they're everywhere they're in useless places

00:03:09.05 I don't know they're in useless places it sounded like scientists so for my

00:03:12.21 interpretation scientists were like where are their taste receptors holy

00:03:16.08 [ __ ] they're taste receptors everywhere

00:03:18.03 we don't know why we don't know why this is this way but you got them all over

00:03:22.00 the place including the butt including the [ __ ]

00:03:24.18 I don't think I've ever tasted anything with anything else like on purpose

00:03:29.16 like what do you mean I know what he means I know what he

00:03:32.21 means he's never noticed a taste on anything on his body other than his

00:03:38.04 tongue yeah I'm never like lying down on a sun lounger and like

00:03:42.08 yeah or he never like spilled a chocolate shake on his knee and went oh

00:03:47.20 I can still taste it well I'm not a scientist I'm not a doctor I

00:03:52.15 don't know how these they work but I do know they're there I do trust

00:03:57.18 smarter more generally educated and informed people about taste receptors or

00:04:02.03 saying that there are taste receptors in

00:04:04.00 your ass and I will trust those people I agree dude I think you can taste stuff

00:04:07.16 with your butthole totally no I don't I believe every taste bud also has taste

00:04:12.13 receptors but not every taste receptor has a bud that's how that works out so

00:04:16.20 the question is uh will Geoff taste his milk icicle that is a great question

00:04:21.18 yeah that is sort of what led into this hold up Geoffy did you do your homework

00:04:25.20 we're getting off track uh first off hello and welcome to another episode of

00:04:32.06 face I believe it is episode 72

00:04:33.18 uh my name is Geoff and with me as always Andrew and brick how are you guys doing

00:04:38.20 I'm doing great I feel like I've established some solid points in this

00:04:42.23 episode I think this one's going well for me I like this I wonder I mean I I

00:04:48.00 get that a taste a bud is oh by the way but you didn't say how

00:04:51.05 you're doing brick that's me right yeah that was what we discovered last week

00:04:57.12 I'll be honest last week my internet was cutting out left and right and I can't

00:05:02.01 remember a lot that happened at one point Andrew was about to say something

00:05:05.23 funny and I didn't hear the end of it and then when I heard the sound come

00:05:11.01 back on he was mad that neither of us reacted to it so I was like

00:05:15.20 I feel like I missed out on something there I guess you haven't been able to

00:05:18.18 listen to that episode yet either I don't know if this was on if we captured

00:05:22.15 this on audio or not but that episode stepped down we stepped down from that

00:05:26.00 episode and we were like that was one of the better episodes we've done in a

00:05:29.00 while I felt really good about it really great and you were like I have no I

00:05:33.05 didn't hear any of it I have no idea what happened

00:05:36.15 I heard the the back half of a lot of sentences and I said a lot of stuff uh

00:05:42.08 followed by silence but who knows how it turned out

00:05:45.10 from what I remember from what I did experience I do remember it being quite

00:05:49.00 a nice one yeah it was a good it was a goodie that was a great pivot though

00:05:52.10 Geoff have you done your whole what is uh what is this back on that how's your

00:05:55.15 homework doing you do your homework oh yeah I picked Tiffany uh I think she's

00:05:59.20 gonna win survivor thanks for asking that's that's Gavin who did you not that

00:06:04.08 was not the homework I picked uh how it's done

00:06:06.13 right right right you picked that guy uh anyway uh what's new with you guys uh

00:06:10.19 what's new is I was just curious if you did the homework of trying the product

00:06:14.15 that you've been trying to pitch for the last last episode 40 minutes of last

00:06:18.22 episode any update on that uh hold on a second let me think about this

00:06:22.07 if I remember what you're talking about uh this is an old bit we did a while

00:06:25.22 back.

00:06:28.23 I tried the beef beef bracelet no yep sure it was that one it wasn't it

00:06:34.00 wasn't the one where you covered your ass in tiger bomb

00:06:38.05 and then was surprised I feel like I can I can smell lawyers coming on the worst

00:06:42.02 part is I don't even know if Gavin can back me up because he missed all of last

00:06:45.12 episode so I feel like this is I'm in a corner

00:06:48.17 I'll be I'll be honest I don't I don't remember what you're talking about but

00:06:53.18 that's not to say it didn't happen uh was this something was it pencil

00:06:58.19 related no no it was like the pencil equivalent of your [ __ ] though it

00:07:02.06 looked like

00:07:09.14 you know I'll be honest with you guys I've been so busy doing other stuff I

00:07:14.20 didn't remember to stick a [ __ ] a joke Popsicle up my [ __ ]

00:07:19.21 Yeah I just it slipped my mind I'm real sorry it's the best place you

00:07:24.17 can slip probably I'm real sorry but I also

00:07:27.12 I gotta be honest with you at 46 years old I don't know that my eye that my

00:07:32.12 prop icicle up my [ __ ] covered in tiger bomb days aren't behind me

00:07:37.18 it might be a younger man's game it might be I could see that well what

00:07:42.08 if we sub what if we sub the pencil for the ice pick I'll tell you what the

00:07:47.05 icicle I'll tell you what it did do okay

00:07:50.10 I scheduled a colonoscopy that'll be way more invasive okay I mean what so

00:07:55.21 is there I've never had a colonoscopy is there pain afterward I'd assume

00:08:01.05 is that uh no not at all you're asleep the whole time

00:08:04.19 but there's nothing that's more invasive it is more invasive but it's just

00:08:08.11 curious they toilet snake a camera through you

00:08:11.21 I'm just I was curious if you would need like some ice

00:08:15.11 in the hole if that would be good if like if there's some swelling down there

00:08:19.03 it could be like a multi-use product the

00:08:21.09 problem with the colonoscopy is the prep

00:08:23.10 that's all the [ __ ] you got to drink to

00:08:25.20 clean yourself and then all the [ __ ] you gotta [ __ ]

00:08:29.08 It's the it's the it's like the 48 hours of [ __ ] your brains out and then

00:08:33.05 like having to drink 18 gallons of this gross contact liquid I'm just imagining

00:08:38.08 a cut man with one of your your popsicles as like a scenario in which

00:08:43.09 that could be needed how terrifying that would be

00:08:45.12 yeah like the lube the wraps I'll be honest I'll be honest I was hoping

00:08:50.01 against hope that you would forget and then we would oh no that's not the

00:08:53.03 only thing I haven't forgotten about Geoff Geoff how fast have you been able to

00:08:56.14 throw a baseball that was a few weeks ago at this point what's your what's

00:09:01.03 your bottom number oh we haven't done it yet I sold the bull

00:09:04.18 yeah gavin's on the ball though why haven't you thrown the ball yet my

00:09:08.17 favorite thing about the ball is that there's three digits on it like who's

00:09:13.11 throwing a hundred miles an hour with that thing

00:09:16.09 I don't know it goes up to 120. So you know why

00:09:19.18 they wouldn't put it there if there wasn't a need

00:09:23.15 uh why I'm all about throwing the ball I

00:09:25.17 don't know because it hasn't been I feel

00:09:26.13 like at this point it's a thing if we're gonna do it there's gotta be we gotta

00:09:30.21 film it right no well yeah film it now yeah I don't I

00:09:35.05 can't he's just it doesn't need to be a thing you setting the low bar the thing

00:09:39.06 is three months from when you throw it that's the thing trying to hit the

00:09:43.18 number did we determine it was three months yes yes we did

00:09:47.12 from the point of view throwing you have

00:09:49.10 three months to prepare for why when did we at three months see when did we land

00:09:53.13 on three months you said it in an episode like three episodes ago or

00:09:57.13 whenever we brought it up you're like I'll throw it and then in three months I

00:10:01.06 said I probably I I doubt I was that definitive I was probably like and if

00:10:04.10 you were very sick because I feel like six is probably closer to what but I

00:10:07.17 don't know we don't know because I will said three it depends hold on two

00:10:11.18 episodes ago you said about six months I

00:10:14.00 think is what nick said okay that's fair uh he typoed that oh yeah he missed he

00:10:19.02 didn't type her you misread his three as a six hours ago

00:10:23.03 you said about six months I think then Eric said six months then nick said six

00:10:27.10 and then he said it in Spanish he said hey guys what's up producer Eric here

00:10:31.12 how's it going um so just wanted to step in and get a

00:10:34.22 definitive call on this Geoff said that he would need three months to train from

00:10:39.12 the first throw of the baseball so he was going to throw the baseball get a

00:10:43.10 baseline for how fast he could throw and then with his shoulder that I think is

00:10:49.01 the one with arthritis he's going to throw

00:10:51.19 80 miles an hour uh just after he has set his initial baseline he said he

00:10:56.12 needed three months to train and then at that point what we're going to do is

00:11:00.12 film it in slow motion get an umpire a catcher and a guy with a radar gun we're

00:11:05.05 gonna go out to a field and uh Geoff is going to throw a baseball

00:11:09.14 probably 72 miles an hour well that would be eight miles

00:11:12.13 under what I need that would be I like the idea that you think you just need

00:11:16.00 three more months to do it that's what I appreciate about three years

00:11:20.01 like three months a little tight but six months I can definitely do it three

00:11:24.21 months uh from when I throw the first baseball

00:11:27.04 I'm saying I don't think we could give you six years I don't think it makes a

00:11:32.08 difference oh it'll definitely happen in six years uh

00:11:36.00 why don't we do a tiered system then if you you get first prize if you do it

00:11:39.11 yeah I'll do it three months with six years you get like bronze

00:11:43.12 we don't need that we'll just we'll do three months and that's what it is

00:11:46.23 we'll throw the baseball soon we have to figure out how to set the distance or

00:11:50.10 whatever on it we'll throw the little baseball soon we'll film that we'll get

00:11:54.06 it officially recorded and then we'll go from there okay I'm not but I'm not the

00:11:59.22 producer of the show so I ca you know well you're the one with the baseball

00:12:05.14 because I feel like you have an agency you have all the pieces

00:12:09.12 I don't know what the producer has to do with literally you just need an iPhone

00:12:14.13 you throw a ball against the wall see you know what I'm doing you know what

00:12:17.18 I'm you know what I'm hearing I'm hearing you produce this bit that's

00:12:21.11 awesome dude what a producer would do great job I'm not producing I'm just

00:12:23.09 telling you how to do this very simple thing that you're avoiding because

00:12:27.05 you're scared that is you're backing down from the air

00:12:29.18 you realize oh no no no it's 80. I'm not scared at all I think 80 is highly

00:12:34.11 doable and I I have every confidence that I can throw this ball 80 miles an

00:12:38.02 hour don't you don't have to worry about it I need I don't know

00:12:41.04 do you need help setting the distance and filming it Geoff.

00:12:45.01 I don't think you need slow motion here's what I need that's what I need I

00:12:48.22 know the normal I need somebody else's face to lift a finger to help me

00:12:53.01 well I've lifted figures before I and I I've haven't I've developed it I

00:12:57.03 can do it again I really appreciate it I really appreciated that time you did it

00:13:00.05 you needed help initially throwing the ball you said you were just going to

00:13:03.03 throw the ball I didn't know that you needed if I would have known that we've

00:13:06.20 already gotten this going yeah let's do it man I think somebody fell on you

00:13:11.11 throwing the ball yes I got to throw the ball to set the

00:13:15.00 base time right I didn't know you needed help with that well I figure I didn't

00:13:19.08 initially but now that it's become a thing if it's going to end up on YouTube

00:13:22.11 if it's going to be a whole deal then I think it should be treated it was always

00:13:25.13 the thing but the thing was the second part the first part was never the thing

00:13:31.03 the thing is you try to actually set 80.

00:13:34.00 Because we all agree with you throw what kind of video do you have where I

00:13:37.05 we don't see the first part and then you just see me throwing 80 miles an hour

00:13:41.22 you don't need a [ __ I we have a video that's not going to exist

00:13:45.12 you're going to have you need a video of

00:13:47.11 me throwing it in the high 50s early 60s

00:13:49.08 and then you need a video of me throwing at 81.82 like Michael Johnson I just

00:13:52.23 love the idea of trying to sell this YouTube channel we have videos such as

00:13:58.02 Geoff rides a bike throws a ball it's really top-notch

00:14:02.04 stuff you and and you ride a jet ski and wait

00:14:05.14 you think that you're gonna top out in your first throw you think you're gonna

00:14:10.22 throw 58 miles an hour and then in three months you're gonna throw 80 miles an

00:14:16.19 hour why not what you just said I think my first throw after not throwing a

00:14:21.06 baseball for however many years will probably probably not be representative

00:14:25.22 of what I could do with even three or four days of training

00:14:30.02 have you thrown the ball at all no I need for us no

00:14:33.13 I don't understand I think I think he needs help with the measurement because

00:14:37.09 you need to set a distance and I assume it calculates from when it goes from

00:14:41.12 zero g to when it feels at impact so if it doesn't know the set distance it

00:14:45.06 doesn't know the speed yeah he's got a point it's a lot of math

00:14:50.06 involved I think it's just maths it's a math spool yeah I don't okay

00:14:54.17 well you should throw a baseball so we get a base number and you can begin your

00:14:59.20 training I'm very excited to see you train six feet six inches is how far it

00:15:04.12 needs to go it's very specific I have I have my burger confidence I'm

00:15:08.12 irrationally confident about burgers historically

00:15:11.17 Geoff is absurd with his baseball throwing speed he's got baseball

00:15:14.12 confidence I'm curious what your confidence is Gavin we haven't

00:15:17.16 encountered yet it yet I don't think like what is the thing that you

00:15:20.12 irrationally believe in yourself being able to do that's interesting

00:15:25.16 have you ever I think I'm I think I've yet to find my confidence

00:15:30.06 like just in general or within a bit for this

00:15:32.12 there has had to have been a time where you're like.

00:15:39.07 I feel like Geoff knows something I don't I'm just laughing and I've yet to find

00:15:44.19 my confidence I'm getting something birdies.

00:15:50.10 I'm trying to think yeah I mean I don't think I've ever been as confident Andrew

00:15:55.06 as you were that you could eat burgers but also that that resulted in

00:15:59.09 nothing for you because you've still never done that or come close uh

00:16:03.16 I've come close I reject that the second time I did it I ate like 42 of them I

00:16:08.10 got close I thought the second time you did it you

00:16:10.21 ordered the wrong ones and then stopped halfway through

00:16:15.05 no that was the third that was the third attempt yeah that was try number three

00:16:21.03 look if you were 42 in away from 50.

00:16:24.02 That's way closer than 58 miles an hour to 80. So I I would say you're closer to

00:16:30.00 your burger victory than jessica's point is his baseball victory

00:16:34.10 that's a fantastic point do you think and I didn't do any training for mine uh

00:16:39.18 about that you tried every day no you tried three times a day [ __ ]

00:16:44.04 that's like that's like if you showed up to a

00:16:46.18 marathon and did no running was like I walk I walk every day I've been training

00:16:50.10 if it's a walking marathon then you're training every day no it's not training

00:16:54.09 just because if you get away it doesn't make a transition and you eat every day

00:16:59.07 that's training that's not training it is training that's not no I reject this

00:17:04.12 by eating eating one burger a day or two if I was eating a burger a day that

00:17:09.09 might be training I I could maybe see that point that's

00:17:13.20 such a specific food and I'm only eating burgers

00:17:16.23 just general eating isn't training.

00:17:20.02 I'm not [ __ ] eating popcorn at the movie theater being like I'm training

00:17:24.05 I'm working I'm putting in the extra time I'm getting a refill like I'm in

00:17:27.20 the gym right now what if you're really [ __ ] you're training that speed has

00:17:31.03 nothing to do with it's a different texture first of all

00:17:34.10 it's like a different thing to do it usage speed if you ate it fast enough

00:17:38.02 your buddy wouldn't realize it yeah but it's not it's like if you're playing

00:17:42.03 tennis and you're [ __ ] playing on clay courts it's not gonna be the same

00:17:45.22 when you're playing on different courts I love the all of you yeah but you're

00:17:49.08 still playing tennis you're still training at tennis all of your analogies

00:17:54.15 involve tennis what are your second one in two weeks

00:17:58.23 what was my other test night.

00:18:08.15 [Music]

00:18:13.01 I played tennis you like tennis almost as much as you

00:18:17.01 like honey oh not even close I'm pretty indifferent to tennis tennis is the

00:18:21.12 great if it's on I'll watch it type sport it's fun but I'm never chasing I'm

00:18:25.14 just related to how many times you brought it up without oh try okay let me

00:18:29.18 think of a different what's uh what's an analogy where you're doing something

00:18:34.06 is uh is walking training for swimming those aren't the same things you're

00:18:38.15 moving your legs in both Jesus you can't you can't apply those

00:18:42.23 two things is the same those are different things you lost me now no but

00:18:46.18 I would say that uh well you gotta kick your legs I would say that there are

00:18:50.23 strokes I would say dog paddling in a pool is probably training for swimming

00:18:55.01 yeah but that's that's swimming yeah so eating eating is eating

00:18:59.12 no but it's different because the part of ingesting food to pour your

00:19:04.00 mouth down your throat and into your stomach it's not the function of eating

00:19:09.11 competitive eating isn't training for the function of eating it's the storage

00:19:13.03 of the food that is what you train for also like jaw things I guess that is

00:19:17.02 technically more like the chewing you gotta build up your muscles you gotta

00:19:20.18 get your strength the majority gonna practice your training technique I'm

00:19:25.04 sure it's all about that [ __ ] there's no problem like like choo choo

00:19:29.12 choo choo uh or like some people are probably like choo choo choo choo choo

00:19:33.20 choo choo choo you don't know no you're not a professional I do

00:19:38.19 I'm not but I did research one night before I was gonna do the thing

00:19:43.03 and it sounds like from my understanding it's about just creating space in your

00:19:47.03 stomach essentially like stretching your stomach out getting it comfortable with

00:19:51.04 expanding it so you can store more than than the base stomach that's where

00:19:55.17 the training you told us that it was you were training your brain to eat quickly

00:20:00.01 because you'd be further along before your brain caught up or some [ __ ] I you

00:20:03.08 had all kinds of no I was just trying to go fast because I figured if I ate as

00:20:06.16 much as possible my brain wouldn't know what was happening until I got I got

00:20:10.07 further along and it worked on the second one I feel like it as you know

00:20:13.20 Andrew it's your redemption year I feel like maybe a fourth attempt it is might

00:20:18.00 be on the cards here's no here's the thing about the burgers when you do the

00:20:22.10 burgers it takes a lot out of you you lose a part of your soul every time you

00:20:26.21 go into that mcdonald's you've you've lost chunks of soul

00:20:30.06 I've lost you know what you more than three chunks

00:20:33.06 do you know what you haven't had to do stick a milk Popsicle up your [ __ ]

00:20:37.00 talk about losing a piece of your soul I'm gonna stab my soul that's what I was

00:20:41.05 saying I think we could potentially write off the entire pencil punishment

00:20:46.15 and just have Andrew do the milk Popsicle oh no

00:20:49.14 I'm not the one selling it that was my issue with Geoff is that he spent 40

00:20:52.17 minutes talking about how great it is yeah but you can you can effectively

00:20:56.02 erase a debt here and it is the redemption year I'm gonna erase a debt

00:21:00.04 by doing Geoff's debt in a bet that I lost to you is that what you're saying

00:21:05.01 is that how that works what I I owe the penalties because I lost

00:21:09.23 me you owe the audience the pence no I owe you the pencil the audience is just

00:21:14.17 demanding it but I owed you the penalty the comment levers have failed to stop

00:21:18.18 leaving comments about the pencil entry I haven't made a bet with the comment

00:21:24.02 levers I made a bet with you and I lost them can I in front can I can I just say

00:21:28.09 it doesn't matter who's in front what's that Geoff as a

00:21:31.17 just just a little aside because this goes into something that I wanted to

00:21:35.00 talk about briefly anyway uh there was a

00:21:37.07 sub there was a thread on Reddit I don't know if either of you or uh if you guys

00:21:41.08 any of you saw it uh recently it was somebody uh got the billy ripken face

00:21:45.21 card and and posted it and then there was like hundreds of people in the

00:21:49.12 comments but the top comment on the billy ripken like just in like baseball

00:21:54.02 cards or whatever threat is eat the pencil Andrew

00:21:58.01 it is the top [ __ ] comment on some other subreddit about that baseball card

00:22:04.02 and then there's about 500 other face comments which is awesome to go to some

00:22:08.01 other corner of the internet and find uh facers comment levers going nuts but it

00:22:12.19 is literally eat the pencil Andrew is the number one comment which I just find

00:22:16.23 to be very funny I mean what more of a perfect end to your redemption here

00:22:20.16 Andrew than to eat a pencil or to swap but you're not pitching that

00:22:26.00 you're saying what more than a perfect end to your redemption here's what they

00:22:31.05 do then you're not doing the thing people are demanding and instead do a

00:22:35.20 thing that Geoff said he would do I'll be right back it makes no sense Gavin

00:22:42.12 year to be as whole as possible and I feel like you're off to a good start but

00:22:48.00 you haven't redeemed yourself in like two months I want it to be as whole as

00:22:53.11 it can while avoiding certain holes I will I will cover

00:22:58.04 upper holes I'm okay with to make it whole lower holes not what if I

00:23:02.00 because here's the thing yeah you got taste receptors in your mouth too yeah

00:23:06.17 that's true could I just try could I do the same test with the mouth what test I

00:23:11.04 need to look into tiger bomb oh to test the efficiency because that's

00:23:15.14 really where this comes down to it's an efficiency test of how how quickly you

00:23:19.16 can remove the spice yeah I don't know like I don't think we know if milk

00:23:23.12 actually counters the spice of a tiger bomb ointment at all I think that's that

00:23:28.04 was the basis of we're thinking that it's only the uh the peppers

00:23:32.05 the hot peppers yeah the uh oh what's it

00:23:34.16 called the uh [ __ ] [ __ ] I'm not going to remember it yeah

00:23:38.14 I don't know why I'm still trying no not that there's a word for it there's a

00:23:43.20 specific spice word people are like oh it has this many of those

00:23:47.23 yeah the scoville yeah that's what I was thinking of so where

00:23:51.16 did you go Geoff here's what I've done uh

00:23:53.21 because I don't want to well first off I

00:23:55.18 got to thinking about it uh I don't want to rile the comment levers up because

00:23:59.07 they get you start talking pencils and they go they get whipped up into a

00:24:02.12 frenzy and it's the same thing with uh the port a potties or the sauces I don't

00:24:06.11 want to I don't want to turn this into a whole other sauce thing so while you

00:24:11.11 guys were arguing about capsaicin or whatever

00:24:13.11 uh I went ahead and just said we'll see what happens I went and I got uh I

00:24:17.17 cracked open a new container of tiger bomb ultra and I put just the tiniest

00:24:21.19 bit of my butthole so I'm just going to sit here and I'm going to deal with that

00:24:24.23 what's wrong with you I'm going to deal with I don't know

00:24:28.17 why it's bad enough I may not have a choice

00:24:32.07 what he won't film it doesn't throw a baseball

00:24:35.13 but he'll just put tiger bomb in his eyes sort of audio podcast yeah I mean I

00:24:40.13 put tiger bomb on my balls on uh achievable hunter video once it's like

00:24:45.16 that part's easy it's I the hard part to me is to mentally

00:24:50.01 you know get there to put that thing in my butthole but if I'm in such

00:24:53.11 excruciating pain is that wise right before a colonoscopy uh that's that's a

00:24:57.20 couple okay I just scheduled it I'm set do you have

00:25:01.06 a no spicy icee is that what what it was called do you have one on here you know

00:25:04.22 the no spider yeah I got the original I got the prototype what do you mean you

00:25:07.23 still have the original it's been in my freezer this whole time

00:25:11.07 I that makes it so much worse for whatever reason it's like two weeks old

00:25:15.15 yeah the older it gets like even though it's just a frozen product I don't know

00:25:19.00 hey did I tell you what my [ __ ]

00:25:20.21 doesn't have taste buds the taste receptors in my butthole aren't going to care

00:25:25.12 that's true that's fair okay it's a wild move by you nick has a good

00:25:30.21 point here he says uh hopefully it's not freezer bird yeah I'm

00:25:34.07 sure it is uh I I'm also not sure it's going anywhere near me we're just gonna

00:25:38.02 see how bad this and and I'll be honest with you it's getting it's getting it's

00:25:42.19 getting it's getting it's so where would you rate the uncomfortable

00:25:48.13 how uncomfortable is it currently between one and ten

00:25:53.05 sounds like it got in his mouth where's your it's a

00:26:00.00 how close is your mouth to your [ __ ]

00:26:03.00 why not it's it's making me cough for some reason and

00:26:07.03 it's I'm sweating I'm sweating like it's hot like I'm outside it's like a oh my

00:26:13.01 god what does it taste like Geoff

00:26:20.12 it's not good this is the new drinking from a can

00:26:25.09 without burping she's gonna do this every week

00:26:29.11 no I'm not I'm not doing this again [Music]

00:26:32.10 I'm not doing this again I don't know why it made me cough but I

00:26:37.05 also cleared my nose out you can clear your nose out through your

00:26:40.07 [ __ ] fix vaporub for your hair it goes all the way goes straight into you.

00:26:46.21 I don't I don't know why you did this I don't know why you're willing to do

00:26:52.12 this but you won't throw I I want I I wanted to calm the pencil

00:26:57.14 beast that's all oh okay respect that but it's just it seems you

00:27:01.20 know it was I did it out of the abundance of love for you Andrew you did

00:27:06.09 I was done you jumped on the grenade you jumped on the pencil grenade it was it

00:27:10.11 was very considerate of you Geoff I appreciate yourself

00:27:13.17 just put his anus over the pencil grenade.

00:27:17.07 I don't know why it's made how did you apply it to your your anus with your

00:27:21.03 finger that I cleaned after yes I washed my hands

00:27:26.17 oh see I can't tell if I'm just shooting right now

00:27:30.18 you did it quite early in the podcast we still got like half of it left

00:27:36.19 yeah well I figured that yeah we'll see Andrew usually suddenly does something

00:27:41.04 right at the end but not usually in the first half well see

00:27:44.12 if I did it at the end if I did it at the end then I could just wait out the

00:27:48.00 podcast ending and then I wouldn't have to face

00:27:51.21 the Popsicle which I'm still you know not super on board with just so you guys

00:27:55.19 know um well you don't have to I was just curious if you did the homework

00:28:00.09 that's really where this stem from no I didn't I didn't okay and I'm taking the

00:28:04.10 punishment I did my homework my homework is done you want to give us

00:28:09.03 a homework update you get us you get us uh you got us a jet ski

00:28:13.22 I've I've secured secured some aquatic vehicles it's all I'll say

00:28:18.10 that was the standard last time I've reached out I've acquired what we need

00:28:23.22 jet skis are in hand possibly I don't want to tip my hand it'll be a

00:28:29.05 nice surprise but we got him I did mine I did mine I don't like the way you

00:28:32.11 phrased it as aquatic vehicles it was like how you phrased writing utensils

00:28:36.13 like we don't know what that's gonna mean uh it's a let well hmm it's a jet ski

00:28:43.07 I think that's fair yes I got us what we

00:28:46.21 needed I did my part you I did my part I wanted to give an update with fireworks

00:28:50.15 on the back of it that's that's a jet ski to you what have you made

00:28:55.05 I haven't made anything I did not make a single thing I've

00:28:59.06 acquired this is a product we're good I've done my part aren't we supposed to

00:29:03.20 do something in gta yes or something first I don't know why you made me do the

00:29:08.04 homework of acquiring the vehicles before we did the part where we're gonna

00:29:11.16 test in a video game if it was worth doing I uh but I've done my part I tried

00:29:15.16 to actually set that up today and I realized I didn't have gta installed and

00:29:18.21 it takes a [ __ ] year to install so it's installing in the background right

00:29:22.00 now so that I can build that map for ah okay

00:29:25.05 how's everybody well I'm excited dude is everybody else hot god damn

00:29:31.12 I don't know get a drink you guys keep I'll be back I need a drink

00:29:36.11 I suffered a great betrayal where do you think he's gonna pull the drink yeah

00:29:39.18 what's the uh that's a great question I'd assume the

00:29:43.13 mouth I don't think the ass you think that Geoff has like a butt chug

00:29:48.19 type set up for if you were going to try to alleviate would you use water

00:29:53.13 like what liquid would you use to on a hot arse yeah

00:29:56.23 yes probably just cold water yeah I think so I probably I'd probably lie

00:30:02.14 down in the bath uh swing the old legs you know knees up towards the head and

00:30:07.13 turn on the cold tap I think I'd go sparkling water personally I want a

00:30:11.03 little bit of bubbles make it a little bit fun

00:30:16.00 yeah yeah yeah it's like a nightmare the bubbling would be a nightmare uh just

00:30:22.09 sounds like a fun time normal water is bland it's been an anus

00:30:27.03 heavy couple of weeks and I think Geoff has guaranteed that by putting something

00:30:32.08 into his this episode um yeah we're not like [Laughter]

00:30:40.06 we're not a podcast about sports uh of survivor or butt holes but well

00:30:45.07 they come up a lot oh oh either my great betrayal my pillow wall betrayed me

00:30:53.05 I got betrayed do you wake up with a stiff neck oh no that has never happened

00:30:58.11 did it collapse on you and bury you no well sort of it didn't bury me so we I

00:31:03.23 had a whole issue I I took some damage the pillow wall fell down it was a great

00:31:09.18 collapse of the pillow wall but I wasn't in the bed when it fell

00:31:13.00 I just climbed into bed and I hate laying on pillows that are on me like

00:31:18.02 underneath me I find it super uncomfortable I need to

00:31:21.06 I like if it's on my body I don't like it I need to have my head or shoulder as

00:31:26.23 the is the main point of contact so I slid down the bed

00:31:29.16 and because the pillow was in like the middle of the bed my feet were hanging

00:31:33.12 out the bottom of the bed by quite a lot

00:31:36.01 and I'm not a fan of that either I still have it baked into it when I was a kid

00:31:40.13 you know like the monster under the bed type thing I don't like any limb or my

00:31:45.14 feet sticking out the bottom it's just easy to grab

00:31:47.23 it makes me uncomfortable I don't like it I'm not a fan of it at all but I

00:31:52.17 slept like that one night it was terrible so the next day or I guess a

00:31:56.11 few days later I was sleeping in my bed and I was dreaming that I was back in

00:32:01.05 that scenario again my dream was that I was in the middle of the bed my feet

00:32:04.11 were sticking out I was like ah this is no good I got to climb up the bed

00:32:08.06 smash my head into the wall I was already at the top of the bed

00:32:12.17 I went full force head first forehead first into my wall

00:32:17.01 smashed it against it wait so you were lying down in bed dreaming that you were

00:32:22.19 lying down in bed but a foot further down yes yes that was my dream and in

00:32:27.05 the dream I was like I need to get hired there was no higher to go but in my

00:32:31.05 dream I picked myself up off the bed and like threw myself upwards and uh I went

00:32:36.02 straight into the wall wasn't it just lift it up and headbutted it what time

00:32:41.05 is is it when this happens it's like 730 a.m maybe and you're dead ass asleep

00:32:47.09 I was dead ass asleep and I got woken up and it [ __ ] it was not good is it

00:32:52.04 dark in the room oh it's so bright as I've said before my blinds are some

00:32:56.19 [ __ ] they don't they don't block anything so it's super bright I'm very

00:33:00.14 confused I'm angry at my dream I'm angry at my pillow wall for deceiving me this

00:33:05.06 deception caused by it collapsing how was none of it of like all the seven or

00:33:08.15 eight pillars how was none of them against the wall though

00:33:12.08 because I was at the very top of the wall so they were I was right but I still

00:33:16.23 it doesn't make any sense still I've seen pictures of it I know how are you

00:33:21.22 sleeping on the top of the eighth pillow how is your back not upright oh I'm on

00:33:25.18 my side so it was a side dive into the wall and I bring some of the pillows

00:33:30.13 down with me I guess I don't I don't know but

00:33:34.10 yeah I woke up to me slamming my head into my wall I like stuff that makes you

00:33:38.18 bad like when you had to take a hate nap oh yeah

00:33:42.09 what's the most annoyed you've been recently over something that doesn't

00:33:45.16 matter like long term in your life ah the most like

00:33:48.10 slipping on a sushi container or something small like that that's not

00:33:51.14 even that was funny I was laughing when I fell on the sushi container yeah I

00:33:54.18 just made something as inconsequential as that the most inconsistent that I was

00:33:59.18 angry about that I was like genuinely frustrated about yeah uh

00:34:04.02 [ __ ] um hmm I don't get frustrated all that often I was uh I was frustrated

00:34:09.18 about I'm not sure if we talked about on this podcast or a different one did I

00:34:15.18 talk about what what always makes me like 10 out of 10 angry suddenly and

00:34:19.18 it's really irrational no no it's if I it doesn't really happen

00:34:23.20 anymore because of wireless headphones but if I ever had like

00:34:27.19 headphones in on a wire and I caught it on like a door handle or

00:34:32.00 something and it ripped the headphones out of my ears it just really pissed me

00:34:36.12 off to the point where I was like way more annoyed than most other things I

00:34:40.21 would go to like from like one out of 10

00:34:43.01 to 10 out of 10 for like five seconds and then back down to one but I can't

00:34:47.03 describe why that's so annoying to me I just

00:34:51.15 I freaking hate it when that happens well luckily that oh man my butt that uh

00:34:57.05 luckily that should never happen to you again right because you'll just use

00:35:02.10 earbuds right uh maybe problem solved you know I got I

00:35:06.19 have one and it involves you oh man

00:35:11.16 yeah I got irrationally angry at you for like two seconds last night when I

00:35:16.15 looked over at you and you were smirking when it looked like my character and

00:35:20.06 survivor was trying to hang yourself uh and get voted out and I was yeah you

00:35:25.05 [ __ ] I was I was like I was angry at you for like I looked over to

00:35:30.12 you and I gave a little like but you can't have been angry angry I

00:35:33.23 was for like one second I was like you and I was like oh yeah this is we're off

00:35:38.14 duty

00:35:42.15 you have that so close to going yeah I don't want us to go necessarily too far

00:35:47.08 down the survivor rabbit hole that's one of the worst picks I've ever

00:35:51.12 seen Geoff that was a horrendous pick I didn't process at the time when you

00:35:55.11 texted it last night what a dog [ __ ]

00:35:57.20 picked 0 chance did that happen I completely

00:36:00.17 and totally agree with you Andrew here's here's how that wins so I thought when

00:36:05.04 we uh I thought when we were going to pick survivor the way Emily and I always

00:36:08.17 do it is we pick who we think is going to win in the opening episode when they

00:36:12.10 do the first reveal with the name and the montage with the names and the

00:36:16.00 characters I picked her there because she had like

00:36:19.15 a cancer surviving story she was you know she's a double mastectomy survivor

00:36:23.16 uh it was like inspirational I know that survivor tends to they the editors tend

00:36:27.05 to love those kinds of stories and those people tend to go far uh and they also

00:36:31.02 have like a new lease on life and they tend to like be able to push themselves

00:36:33.09 further and stuff because they like no matter how bad this is it's probably not

00:36:36.12 as bad as what they've gone through previously you know so I feel like some

00:36:39.22 sometimes those people tend to like tend to rise to the top uh in survivor

00:36:44.12 and so I made the decision then in my head and then when we didn't end up

00:36:48.14 picking until later on at the end the next reason I thought well to be fair to

00:36:52.14 the way I play it anyway I'll just stick with who my first thought was because

00:36:56.05 that's who my first thought was and I don't think she'll win and I'm amazed

00:36:59.13 that she didn't get herself voted out this week why I picked the guy that

00:37:02.23 looks like Dave england and Howard stern had a baby

00:37:06.13 he's my favorite character of the show so far I think he's going to text him no

00:37:12.02 I think he will make it to the end I'm just surprised so they did their whole

00:37:15.18 manta as you're right Geoff her whole story very inspiring also a key part of

00:37:19.15 her story was that she was almost not on the show it sounded like she was a

00:37:23.23 replacement for a replacement she almost yeah

00:37:26.20 so I don't I'm surprised that that also didn't factor in like clearly not a top

00:37:31.20 no it's more like it it was meant to be okay fair enough I like gavin's pick

00:37:36.23 more and I thought when I I think I'm so distracted by gavin's pick that I

00:37:41.18 completely missed yours and that is it's a great pick the

00:41:19.03 I have a I have another note in my face notes that I don't understand

00:41:24.04 okay and uh similar to similar to blogger or folders I don't

00:41:28.17 know what this means okay this is the note

00:41:32.19 timing pisses wrong anyone else sucked a glass timing pisses so

00:41:39.03 what could that mean suck the glass could be in reference to when I gave

00:41:44.03 myself hickeys sucking the bottle cap maybe we talked about glass sucking at

00:41:49.07 that time I don't know if that's that's related to that timing pissing

00:41:53.23 I'm thinking about Austin powers I don't know

00:41:57.03 is this a recent when do you write your notes um

00:42:01.09 this is a fairly this is probably the last two months

00:42:05.03 no I don't can't oh nick says is this a drink contest so you can go the longest

00:42:09.20 without pissing no I don't think it's that is that your house is another one

00:42:13.12 you have pissed confidence no I don't have piss confidence narrow

00:42:17.15 that off the list what could that mean comment leavers um let me know if by the

00:42:22.04 way can I just say this is perfect retribution for me for all the years you

00:42:26.17 made fun of me for not understanding my notes that I'd write in the idea book.

00:42:32.00 [Laughter]

00:42:33.05 I love this and I was sober when I wrote that.

00:42:37.01 I had a realization I know Geoff you've seen it I've talked to Eric about it

00:42:41.19 Gavin has no idea I'd love to ask Gavin this question okay just to see

00:42:46.13 see his perspective have you ever seen a train car outside of the mcdonald's no

00:42:53.11 so I the mcdonald's where I grew up both of them had train cars outside of them

00:42:59.05 was on the street what do you mean on a track no like like right next to the

00:43:02.22 restaurant like they were connected to the they were right outside they were

00:43:06.13 like probably like I don't know 15 feet away from the restaurant typically

00:43:10.20 to the side when you'd have a birthday party that's where they'd hold the party

00:43:14.08 all the kids would get to go on the train you eat in the mcdonald's it was

00:43:18.12 called ronald's caboose and it was just part

00:43:21.15 it was part of my mcdonald's experience growing up and I was thinking I'd never

00:43:26.00 thought about it my whole life until like two nights three nights ago it's

00:43:30.02 like that's [ __ ] weird that there's nothing about the mcdonald's brand

00:43:33.22 that has trains tied to it why was there

00:43:36.11 a train in these mcdonald's why was this thing

00:43:39.12 so I I asked somebody they lived in different country so I assumed like oh

00:43:43.07 that makes sense that they wouldn't have it um

00:43:46.17 but then I learned that apparently the mcdonald's train is not a universal

00:43:50.07 staple of like 90s childhood mcdonald's there are like rare there's only a

00:43:55.04 handful of mcdonald's that had these trains I still don't know why they are

00:43:59.01 I'll try to so they were specifically put there

00:44:02.10 they didn't just buy a lot of land that had a train stuck on it no they were

00:44:06.00 they specifically bought these trains for their restaurants it wasn't like

00:44:10.14 they acquired it with the purchase of the land they brought cabooses in at one

00:44:15.14 point according to this train website I read that

00:44:18.10 mcdonald's as a business owned more cabooses than any other in the world

00:44:23.02 more than a trade company they had more cabooses than like freight companies

00:44:26.23 listen I I realized that that seems like an absurd statement I'm not the one

00:44:30.18 sourcing it this was according to some train fan website and I'm gonna trust

00:44:35.09 the enthusiasm if you own a train website and you're updating it I feel

00:44:39.09 like you're probably pretty knowledgeable about traits is a caboose

00:44:44.00 a specific type of train car or is it just the back one like what what

00:44:48.12 so based off of the images that I've seen I think there is a regulation

00:44:53.02 caboose it might have slight slight changes as far that was another weird

00:44:58.06 thing there was no structure to how they had to look like

00:45:02.14 there was regulations and I guess their company policy of where you could place

00:45:08.00 them but every mcdonald's every ronald's

00:45:11.05 caboose painted a little bit differently oh this episode regulation caboose

00:45:15.22 regulation caboose let me see if I can find photos of it appears we've lost

00:45:21.18 Geoff we have lost Geoff we've lost Geoff to his own anus

00:45:25.09 he wrote in the chat I gotta go deal with this it hurts too bad brb

00:45:30.15 this is a photo of ronald's caboose this is the one of the ones outside of

00:45:35.11 outside of mcdonald's where I live this is a ronald's caboose cap

00:45:39.16 it is like painted red and yellow like mcdonald's it is there's a few other

00:45:44.22 ones that I like I'm not sure where this one is based out of this is one of my

00:45:48.02 favorite designs it looks like it's just ramming into the restaurant like it's

00:45:51.17 moments before disaster they've built a mcdonald's on a train car this is I've

00:45:56.22 never seen anything like this it expanded I thought the ones the

00:46:00.10 mcdonald's with like the golden arches were the rare ones like the old style

00:46:04.01 ones the ones with a train crashed through the side of the building that's

00:46:07.08 the rare one where is that I'd have no idea where that one is I've I have

00:46:10.21 another one though it gets wild there's a variation I just don't think people

00:46:14.06 realize that there's a whole theme of mcdonald's based vehicle restaurants

00:46:18.18 there is a mcdonald's plane in new Zealand

00:46:21.12 they've got a plane version where you can like order the food from the

00:46:24.20 restaurant and then hop in the plane eat in the plane

00:46:28.09 I like that the wheel is off the ground as if it was taken off there it is yeah

00:46:33.18 I'd fly air mcdonald's have you eaten in a caboose

00:46:37.16 I have yeah as a child on Vancouver island on where I live yeah there I've

00:46:41.07 been to birthday parties in the room add that to the list when we're crabbing I

00:46:45.23 think it's sadly gone they've renovated since then that's why I thought it was

00:46:49.01 like a weird 90s thing because they're no longer there at least where I live

00:46:52.16 and I was like oh that's a shame that they they upgraded their restaurants and

00:46:56.02 they got rid of the trains that's the this is the last known photo Gavin of

00:47:01.03 ronald's caboose at the one restaurant it's gone they took it away

00:47:05.11 that's the saddest thing I've ever seen it is yeah what a bleak looking day

00:47:12.06 oh that's tragic yeah it was very tragic so it's a weird

00:47:17.01 it's a weird thing where I thought everyone had this experience and I guess

00:47:21.09 it's very unique to have a ronald's caboose well that's special menu items

00:47:25.06 for the caboose no it was just like literally a place for birthday parties

00:47:28.18 there's nothing like fancy about it it was just you got to hop in the train and

00:47:32.05 you were separated from the rest of the people in the restaurant that's part of

00:47:35.23 the experience that is amazing that's blowing my mind a little bit

00:47:39.23 spaghetti warehouse has train cars inside the warehouse you can eat in

00:47:43.17 spaghetti where I've never heard of this

00:47:45.12 I've heard of the spaghetti factory I've

00:47:48.17 never heard of a warehouse the spaghetti warehouse getty warehouse yeah

00:47:52.18 cheesecake factory the spaghetti warehouse maybe yeah probably what was

00:47:57.14 the thing cheesecake factory workers don't identify as factory workers um

00:48:04.10 but I feel like this is sort of a great people are always like ah andrew's weird

00:48:08.20 but I don't think I'm weird it's just this is a product of of where I grew up

00:48:12.17 yeah that picture of the mcdonald's train that means you're not weird yeah I

00:48:17.08 think it's more of a people are like you're in a different dimension maybe I am

00:48:22.21 oh that's a fancy train car for that spaghetti place it's a spaghetti

00:48:27.12 warehouse it's it's not just for anybody it's high class [Laughter]

00:48:31.20 also uh uh I gotta be honest with you guys if anything it made it worse okay

00:48:44.10 oh no oh no Geoff clearly uh clearly we need to uh go back to the drawing board

00:48:52.23 which is fine that's what it is that's what r d is is for I think that we need

00:48:58.00 to incorporate uh if I had to guess maybe some aloe

00:49:02.12 yeah into the the milk substance that's just milk

00:49:07.12 yeah but uh I'm not giving up on the idea uh I think there's still obviously

00:49:13.14 a need uh the audience has been uh has this even come out to the audience yet

00:49:18.14 the one recording no they haven't seen any of this

00:49:22.10 they're not even aware of the product I I'm sure that when the audience

00:49:25.18 discovers the product I'll feel vindicated uh everybody's gonna want a piece

00:49:32.02 are the ones in the slack but uh yeah uh let me just it's uh I

00:49:38.15 didn't it's uh if anything it made it made it burn more

00:49:42.17 so so the cooling effect just made it cold but it still burned

00:49:47.05 yeah it was it was just like it just made everything it's like it was it's

00:49:51.11 like enhanced the uh enhanced the whole thing um and how was the flavor

00:49:56.08 oh you know I don't like milk well maybe maybe you're selling the wrong thing

00:50:01.09 Geoff maybe this isn't a thing to suit the pain maybe this is an enhancer

00:50:06.17 product yeah this is an anal enhancer that you have on your hands

00:50:11.09 needs to enhance anything in the anus I I mean would you

00:50:14.22 opt out of enhancing anything if you have the choice to enhance you always

00:50:18.07 say yes there's no negative to enhance you talking about if someone said you

00:50:21.14 want me to enhance your headache I'd say no thanks well no it could be a better

00:50:25.15 headache yeah you don't turn what do you mean when you when you didn't go to

00:50:29.22 sight when you were in cyberpunk you didn't go oh no enhancements for me

00:50:35.07 think I'll keep my normal anus with a sword and double jump

00:50:39.09 I feel like typically the enhancement is a good thing oh

00:50:42.10 but I see what you're saying an enhancement of a headache would be a bad

00:50:45.11 thing because you're you're theoretically making it more powerful

00:50:48.04 yeah do you want to have an enhancement at losing a roulette well I don't need

00:50:52.17 that I'm already pretty good at that that's that's not needed um

00:50:57.01 I I don't think yeah I think that enhancement most things and I'm listen

00:51:01.12 I'm not a judgmental person Gavin if somebody wants to enhance their [ __ ]

00:51:05.12 it's not my business to know why just offering a product that will do that

00:51:10.04 that's true you got to cover the market just because it's not for you doesn't

00:51:13.22 mean it's not for somebody exactly there's somebody out there that

00:51:18.19 has been waiting for years if only my [ __ ] could be enhanced

00:51:23.09 they've been saying there's got to be a better way there has to be

00:51:28.04 and there also has to be a better way than what you designed because I refuse

00:51:33.11 to believe that a skewer with a milk thing on the end of it prototype

00:51:38.09 it wasn't meant to be the final production model it says you got to

00:51:42.21 start somewhere so based on this new r d is there going to be a a mark ii ah

00:51:50.04 I don't think so I think I don't know man I think I think I got

00:51:55.01 all the I think we got all the comedy out of that joke I think we'll just move

00:51:59.04 on to the next product maybe I think if I was going to design something to

00:52:02.16 soothe the anus it wouldn't be something that's long and goes in the anus it

00:52:07.11 would be something long that you sit on well maybe like a

00:52:11.18 like a like a frozen hot dog shape that I just said and it sort of goes across

00:52:17.16 across the anus across the gooch no it's just a soothing what if you need

00:52:23.05 internal soothing I'm not a fan of any of this why not

00:52:27.12 I just don't want hands control I don't wanna I don't want gravity to be a

00:52:32.01 factor in my my process how's gravity what do you mean well well I'm assuming

00:52:37.18 well if you're making well I guess okay in my head you were like sitting on

00:52:43.09 not not not with it up me it's not okay that's what that's how I

00:52:47.18 personally hot dog in gavin's contraption I believe the hot dog is horizontal

00:52:52.21 yeah Gavin straddles a horizontal hot dog

00:52:56.08 is how this guy think of it think of it like I'm riding a hot dog like a wizard

00:53:01.05 would ride a brewery I see what you're saying yeah understood

00:53:05.20 that's better I still don't like this product category as a whole

00:53:11.01 no it's I'm not gonna be ordering yeah now it is

00:53:14.00 I wonder how many we could sell though just as a concept what that looks like

00:53:19.20 yeah I don't know merch didn't seem too excited about it [Laughter]

00:53:24.12 you actually asked them as well that's not a joke it was in the slack asking

00:53:28.17 about selling popsicles yeah and they said that we don't have like some

00:53:34.04 frozen storage we have cold storage for the popsicles the limitations of this

00:53:38.16 product was us not having cold storage there are no other issues with why this

00:53:42.15 could be sold as it is well as I said the one inhibitor you can buy you buy

00:53:47.07 pop ice and otter pops unfrozen and then you freeze them yourself at home they

00:53:51.03 make you do the work it's the it's the dairy of it you can't have unfrozen

00:53:54.10 dairy it just doesn't keep that long in a warehouse I assume even pivoting back

00:54:00.13 to the mcdonald's train for a moment also

00:54:03.08 it brought back a memory okay life that I that I forgot that I had and it blew

00:54:08.10 it blew eric's mind in our conversation about it there was a wendy's

00:54:12.21 uh downtown still there when I was a kid I was like I don't know

00:54:17.19 maybe four or five I'd go there quite a bit

00:54:21.09 and there was a woman there's an older woman I'd say probably late 60s early

00:54:26.10 70s she had red hair and her name was Wendy

00:54:29.12 and because of this I thought that she was the Wendy of Wendy's

00:54:34.13 and I spent a large probably was until I was a teenager that I realized that I

00:54:38.03 didn't know Wendy from Wendy's I thought I knew Wendy from Wendy's for a stretch

00:54:43.09 of my life dude it's very Wendy of Wendy's worked in a Wendy's in Canada

00:54:47.12 yeah yeah well I didn't like I was like you know what she looks a lot younger

00:54:51.04 outside the restaurant I'm sure this business has existed for a long time

00:54:55.11 she's just been a career ploy it's a family locally run thing

00:54:59.07 Wendy from Wendy's I thought I knew Wendy from Wendy's and we're close

00:55:03.05 whenever I'd come in the restaurant she she'd say hi we'd talk she'd sometimes

00:55:08.00 sit at our table and just talk with us while we ate

00:55:12.17 I had a friendship with Wendy in your defense I mean Dave Thomas named.

00:55:17.03 Wendy's after his daughter right Wendy who is a real.

00:55:23.05 I'm sure this lady who worked at who was in her 60s and working at wendy's and

00:55:28.11 her name was Wendy if it was even her real name was probably delighted to let

00:55:33.10 that little kids thought she was the windy she probably encouraged that and

00:55:37.21 that's probably why you thought it was the case I feel like I probably asked

00:55:41.17 somebody and they're like yeah and just like the magic of it let the kid think

00:55:45.09 that he knows Wendy from Wendy's but I never really questioned it so is this

00:55:48.13 something you bragged about at school I never bragged about it but it's just the

00:55:51.22 fact that I was friends with Wendy from Wendy's you don't strike me as someone

00:55:56.13 who brags uh yeah I I don't I don't know I'm trying

00:55:59.00 to think like what have I ever bragged about I'm not a big bragger type person

00:56:03.08 I I have confidence that the burger confidence is established I very rarely

00:56:07.07 will brag about something that's windy did the lady look like this one and she

00:56:11.08 does work at wendy's so technically it's not the most ridiculous I don't think

00:56:15.16 she works in a wendy's though well she works for wendy's corporate hey wait is

00:56:20.21 Wendy wait the date the Dave tom Dave Thomas

00:56:23.22 was the Wendy's guy right yeah and his daughter's name is Wendy Thomas Eric is

00:56:28.12 saying that that it's that it's not that

00:56:30.13 it's I thought it was I agree with you I thought that's what the story was Geoff

00:56:34.06 that he named it after his daughter and his daughter who Eric what's going on

00:56:37.11 red hair in this photo that Geoff just posted she's the fourth child of American

00:56:41.20 business man Dave Thomas founder of the fastest and what's her name Melinda liu

00:56:46.01 Wendy Thomas so one of the the younger kids couldn't couldn't pronounce Melinda

00:56:50.13 and called her Wendy and Dave Thomas went the name of the restaurant's

00:56:53.13 wendy's so he named it name it after any of his kids yeah he named it after what

00:56:58.08 his kid one kid called another kid a nickname if one kid calls another kid

00:57:02.03 that name but nobody else does that's the nickname do you think that nobody

00:57:05.11 else in the family called that kid windy after that after I think they did after

00:57:09.03 Dave Thomas named a restaurant after after I think they all went we better

00:57:13.13 buy into this lie after her he named a restaurant after her that's a

00:57:17.14 good point you said it you made the point thank you

00:57:20.10 yeah Dave Thomas went uh yeah we're gonna call it wendy's and everyone went

00:57:23.20 well I guess we better buy into this lie I I don't understand she has Wendy in

00:57:28.05 her name it may not be your first name but she's a Wendy internet did she have

00:57:32.13 any siblings I think four I think Geoff just said four oh yeah

00:57:36.13 she's the fourth child okay oh that is a rough one yeah if

00:57:40.21 she's the youngest of the kids that's some [ __ ] if I was the oldest

00:57:46.02 I'd want naming rights or the other kids

00:57:49.04 names do you know Geoff uh here I'll just read what it says on uh as a child

00:57:52.23 Melinda was unable to pronounce her I's and her r's struggling with her own name

00:57:58.12 Melinda and so became known by her nickname Wendy

00:58:01.05 see and then the rest of the family bought into it to feed this lie of

00:58:05.12 wendy's the restaurant then eight-year-old Melinda would eventually

00:58:08.16 become the namesake of her father's restaurant wendy's old-fashioned

00:58:11.19 hamburgers or just wendy's for short in addition to being here

00:58:16.06 her likeness was used as the wendy's logo now I'm an only child

00:58:20.01 and but I feel like I hear about the conversations of like who's the favorite

00:58:24.23 kid you cannot make that argument that family when one of the four has a

00:58:29.22 restaurant chain named after them it's without a

00:58:32.01 wendy's number one I'd like to know the other names though because it's like was

00:58:36.02 there a scenario in which maybe we had steve's

00:58:39.10 uh well let's see if it lists a family personal life they don't cut corners at

00:58:45.14 steve's square burgers his wife was Lorraine uh they had three

00:58:49.21 more daughters pam lorraine's pam Laurie molly and son Kinney Kinney died in

00:58:55.16 2013. Kenny's I would like kenny's pants I got a caddies oh my butt

00:59:02.10 kenny's would be good I'm a fan of kenny's have you

00:59:07.11 am I the only one have you guys ever thought you met a celebrity and then

00:59:12.23 realized it wasn't that celebrity uh oh that's a great question I have another

00:59:18.12 one if you guys need time to think about it I have a second I don't think I have

00:59:23.05 one guy that you know we used to work with at the day job uh Bernie he had a

00:59:28.15 great story about how he called uh Nicholas cage nick nolte in an elevator

00:59:34.06 once and just like crushed Nicholas cage uh but I don't think I have

00:59:37.19 oh man I hope this is a fart oh I don't I'm not gonna do it yeah what's your the

00:59:42.04 one entry I thought I sat behind Ridley Scott at a

00:59:45.12 hockey game once and it wasn't Ridley Scott

00:59:48.06 but I was like behind him and to the left of him so I can only see the side

00:59:51.19 profile of his face that's a weird one like how many people know what Ridley

00:59:55.07 Scott looks like anyway yeah I don't know but I I was convinced it was Ridley

00:59:59.20 Scott I was very excited about it and it was at the time where it had just been

01:00:03.14 announced that he was going to make a monopoly movie

01:00:06.11 and I didn't want to just like say hey are you really Scott or like get any

01:00:10.22 attention by him at all so I just spent the majority of the game just making

01:00:15.12 random Ridley Scott like you hear about this

01:00:18.03 monopoly movie that Ridley scott's going to make I think that could be real

01:00:21.12 interesting like just random quips about

01:00:23.18 Ridley Scott and the Philips he's worked I you know that alien is sure good I'm

01:00:28.05 really hoping that uh I don't know they maybe make another I was wrong about

01:00:32.06 that I shouldn't have wanted that but at that time

01:00:34.16 alien would be good yeah we really didn't need more alien really by him at

01:00:38.13 least yeah I don't think any of any of the

01:00:41.04 alien movies he made post I listened to the audio commentary that he did for

01:00:45.17 alien and uh he was describing like the space jockey and what he thought this

01:00:49.20 was before pro me the us and what he like thought that was he was like going

01:00:53.10 through what he thought that story would be sounded way cooler than the movie

01:00:57.03 that he actually made [Laughter]

01:00:59.01 do you remember what it was oh it was like what was no it was that was that

01:01:03.14 was a hell of a commentary it was all like cut up I think we talked about it

01:01:07.03 there was bits where like like he was he

01:01:09.00 was doing the commentary and it was it's like edited between him and other cast

01:01:12.12 members and he's talking to sigourney weaver in some parts but then another

01:01:16.13 part he's like you kind of like joke complaining about the actors and

01:01:19.21 sigourney weaver doesn't say anything and I realized that they're from like

01:01:23.18 two different commentaries filmed or like recorded years apart it's so

01:01:27.01 confusing it's it's it's a it's a real good one is that one of your go-to did

01:01:31.12 you listen to a lot of commentary tracks I mean that's what do you mean is that

01:01:34.13 just a thing you listen to it's commentary tracks uh yeah I listen to

01:01:38.04 him sometimes yeah there was like podcasts for me growing up I loved

01:01:42.21 listening yeah I was very confused I didn't understand uh the sarcasm of

01:01:46.19 will ferrell or or just like I didn't really have a concept of who he was as a

01:01:51.18 personality I listened to the taligana knights commentary track as

01:01:55.04 a kid and it's just constantly it's not like any actual commentary it's just

01:01:59.19 jokes from my memory and one of the things that is like yeah my house is

01:02:03.12 shaped like a Nascar I'm that much of a Nascar man so I thought that wilfredo's

01:02:07.20 house was a Nascar I thought it was shaped that way I had no idea

01:02:11.23 I used to love commentary it's one of the like worst parts of streaming for me

01:02:15.20 I wish that Netflix or whatever still did commentary try now as an alternate

01:02:22.08 uh Jake Scott oh which is his son it's as close as I've been to Ridley Scott

01:02:27.11 yeah yep you asking about pro me the us nope I don't

01:02:31.03 think it'd been made yet I didn't see that movie not good it's not worth it no

01:02:35.10 uh I don't think you get anything from it it's not canonical to alien though is

01:02:39.06 it yes I thought it wasn't it's I thought it was inspiring it's all like it's

01:02:44.01 supposed to fit in the universe they're all the same universe yeah is it yeah

01:02:47.17 it's leading into I think the idea of pro me the us was it would end with the

01:02:51.12 beginning of alien it would tell that story and then go

01:02:55.18 forward but it's the first of a trilogy right

01:02:57.23 originally yeah but I feel like the second alien covenant or whatever

01:03:01.22 doesn't really have anything to do with pro me the us I mean Ridley Scott yeah it

01:03:05.12 does it's like a direct sequel it says sir Ridley Scott has told bbc radio 5

01:03:10.19 that his new film pro me the us is not a prequel to it 1979 hit alien I mean it's

01:03:15.03 set before alien in the same universe though and it has a lot of the same

01:03:19.07 imagery I don't feel like alien Kevin it I feel so to me

01:03:23.10 I feel like it was a correction like I don't like I understand there are

01:03:26.21 characters that continue and it is a continuous plot but I don't feel like

01:03:30.18 that was the story he originally planned

01:03:32.20 on telling at that trilogy if that makes any sense yeah I mean if it was I don't

01:03:36.19 know why you would want to tell that story yeah it's

01:03:41.01 I've been watching the Halloween movies yeah they're great yeah they're like

01:03:46.19 really bad and then they get so at the first one great

01:03:50.13 two through six terrible I'm now in the 90s ones fantastic

01:03:54.05 I cool j he's great great cast like surprisingly good Michelle Williams is

01:03:59.00 in it josh hartnett's first movie Joseph Gordon-levitt

01:04:02.15 those are fun if you're looking for a random dumb thing to watch Halloween

01:04:06.17 yeah they're uh how have you watched them all uh no I'm uh what's the one I

01:04:11.10 just I watched Halloween h2o last night so I'm going to get the next

01:04:15.01 the buster rhymes one day and you're uh you're watching them in

01:04:18.07 order I am what did you think of Halloween three it's a really cool movie

01:04:21.19 I wish that they would have stuck with that instead of so originally Michael

01:04:25.01 Myers wasn't going to be an ongoing character like Halloween was going to be

01:04:28.10 a different story yeah each time it was just going to be based on on it

01:04:32.01 happening on Halloween and then they they didn't do that because people were

01:04:34.00 pissed that Michael Myers was in it people were I wish they would have stuck

01:04:37.20 with that instead of seven Michael Myers movies

01:04:40.17 Paul rudd also in it it's weird it has like a surprisingly good cast for what

01:04:44.06 this is all of those horror movies from that era

01:04:48.06 do I mean Kevin bacon is in uh Friday the 13th and

01:04:50.21 you know johnny depp is in nightmare on elm street and there was a Corey feldman

01:04:55.01 is in Friday 13th there's a lot of like what what people that Corey feldman's

01:04:59.02 step Corey feldman was phenomenal as a kid actor he was great in that movie

01:05:02.01 that's fair it's one of the best horror movies it's uh I think it's Friday 13th

01:05:06.00 four or five he's in it's really good I'm disappointed that you guys have

01:05:10.06 never thought you meant a celebrity and and went through that that pain

01:05:13.20 I tend to try to avoid celebrities if I see them that's fair

01:05:17.21 I mean in the scenarios I'm talking about I wasn't actively pursuing them I

01:05:21.04 just thought I knew Wendy and then I thought I met Ridley Scott it definitely

01:05:25.18 wasn't that guy must have been like why was he

01:05:28.09 why did he spend an hour or I guess two and a half hours for a hockey game.

01:05:32.15 [Laughter]

01:05:34.10 Do you think that guy no weird thing do you think the guy even knows who Ridley

01:05:38.00 Scott is almost certainly not I agree with Gavin I feel like well maybe by

01:05:41.09 name I guess like awareness I could definitely pull Ridley

01:05:44.06 Scott out of a lineup because you know just of the industry I'm in but

01:05:47.17 I feel like most people know the name not the face I couldn't pull him out of

01:05:51.16 a lineup you don't think so I can't picture Ridley Scott in my head right

01:05:54.18 now now he looks kind of like Jake Scott that's fair

01:05:58.13 uh I think we should probably go because we lost our support staff

01:06:02.02 uh and they all took off and I gotta go figure out what to do about my butthole

01:06:05.20 but uh before we go I would like to point out that somebody on one of the

01:06:10.08 comment levers uh pointed out to me that mac Jones who was gavin's choice to uh

01:06:14.08 win rookie of the year uh that we picked for you I didn't realize

01:06:18.02 and I watched him the entire time he worked uh he quarterbacked for Alabama I

01:06:22.07 didn't realize his name is Michael Jones which is kind of funny uh and then uh

01:06:27.18 the mac comes from his middle name mccorkle

01:06:31.14 your pick for rookie of the year's name is Michael mccorkle Jones

01:06:38.02 that's a great name hey Gavin do you want to trade rookie of

01:06:42.12 the years do not do it do not do it do you want to trade.

01:06:51.09 I feel like macaulay culkin should call his kid that mccorkle culkin

01:06:57.16 can we name this episode mccorkle culkin.

01:07:07.11 I have no idea if this was a good episode or not but if you made it around

01:07:12.06 to the end I appreciate it thank you for listening to episode 72 of face we will

01:07:17.16 see you next week I don't give a [ __ I if you rate or review or not you do you

01:07:23.01 bye we never even got to the thing about the

01:07:26.06 feet I forgot to mention that I was right about that too I guess I will give

01:07:30.07 me a half point on the taste buds and the ass thing if you put your feet on

01:07:34.12 garlic you taste that it goes oh you caught it

01:07:37.14 we're not saving that for this episode no no no no no no no

01:07:42.10 Craig is still in here Craig is still in here

01:07:44.16 technically live we can't keep talking about garlic feet after every recording

01:07:48.22 no no this is we're done we're done with this one it just needs to be on the

01:07:52.12 record that if you put your feet in garlic you're gonna taste that garlic is

01:07:56.15 that true I don't know if it's garlic specific I don't know if you can put

01:08:01.03 like a ham sandwich down there and you taste that

01:08:03.17 but it's definitely a thing with garlic and it has something to do how do you

01:08:08.12 talk about because it's just a fact Geoff how do you know anything

01:08:12.05 where did you write on the fact okay where did you read it I don't know where

01:08:15.18 I read it why but I don't know what I have

01:08:18.04 why is he yelling I don't know I haven't just the first time hearing this you're

01:08:21.22 I wasn't in your career I'm trying to cancel

01:08:24.08 Geoff you weren't here for this this is the second week in a row gavin's tried

01:08:28.00 to block the truth about garlic why did you never bring it up in the pokemon

01:08:32.12 because I forgot I forgot because we changed subjects we're talking about

01:08:36.15 baseballs can Craig cut this out can we put this out anyway will Craig record

01:08:41.01 yeah I'm still recording I'm not recording I'll go back I'm not

01:08:45.01 recording I will I will go back to recording I'm recording again hold on

01:08:49.08 let me get a new [ __ ] I'm back to record

01:08:52.04 so now do I need to do this again do I need to tell the world about how right I

01:08:56.08 am about garlic feet I just dropped the bottle how do you have you tried it

01:09:01.01 no I haven't tried it I'll gladly try what do you mean just because I haven't

01:09:04.12 tried something doesn't mean you don't know it what are you what are you saying

01:09:07.19 so did you taste the sushi when you were slipping across your floor in the

01:09:10.19 container there was no sushi in the container it was a plastic residue there

01:09:16.08 was a plastic lid I'm gonna Google do Google it beat

01:09:21.07 yahoo search it I don't care you're gonna find the same result it's a thing

01:09:26.19 okay all right read it read it read it to the people I'll read it right now

01:09:32.00 it's not because you have secret garlic taste buds on your feet it's because the

01:09:38.12 molecules responsible for garlic smell which is called a listen a-I-I-i-c-i-n

01:09:44.00 can penetrate your skin get into your blood and travel to your mouth and nose

01:09:49.05 where you suddenly start to sense the taste of garlic it goes from your blood

01:09:54.17 to your nose and mouth that quickly too apparently that is

01:09:59.01 I want to do a blind stomp test and see if Andrew see if Andrew could

01:10:04.08 taste the garlic and get him to stand on three things people put garlic on their

01:10:08.20 feet to treat athlete's foot and to fight fungus and I think that is the

01:10:13.18 best idea you've ever had Gavin we need a foot taste test

01:10:17.18 if I drop the garlic at a restaurant and

01:10:20.04 my steak's a bit plain I could just take my socks off and stomp on it.

01:10:25.12 I wonder oh my god could you eat a plate a plain steak while your foot is in

01:10:31.07 garlic and taste a garlic steak I need to uh are do they make garlic

01:10:38.02 like apples are there different variations of garlic are you asking if

01:10:43.03 you could scrump garlic no no no no I mean I'm not

01:10:46.20 I would never publicly discuss scrumping of any kind but I meant in the sense of

01:10:51.05 there's like uh there's a granny smith there's a fuji there's a mag

01:10:55.03 different variations yeah there's like same way there's like.

01:10:59.20 I need to get more familiar with garlic and we could do like a whole foot garlic

01:11:04.02 test I think I could get good at that like a blindfold could we do maybe like

01:11:08.09 a what taste mess like a blind taste test of what your garlic preferences

01:11:12.23 based off of your foot foot taste you could have to like step on ginger in

01:11:17.16 between to clear your palate

01:11:22.13 that reminds me of another thing I have an issue with

01:11:26.21 I have never gone into a grocery store and seen a sign that says these apples

01:11:32.08 are new but they're inventing apples all the time

01:11:35.18 what do you mean I don't know well like the apples apples are constantly being

01:11:41.01 invented they're constantly making new apples but

01:11:44.18 I've never gone into a grocery store been like this apple just released it

01:11:49.20 just came out you got to try this apple like someone's bred a new apple like you

01:11:55.11 know they don't release like new apples don't drop like albums

01:11:58.21 exactly that's what I'm saying and they should

01:12:02.02 they should I feel like people are just like apples around people don't realize

01:12:05.14 how recent apples are oh man I feel like he's the newest lady is that the newest

01:12:10.04 mainstream apple all right hold on why don't you Google this what's the newest

01:12:13.09 app yeah why why podcast ends apple I don't know I don't even know

01:12:17.18 where this is is this uh but this we're we're making [ __ ] like

01:12:21.16 this has gotta why don't we

01:12:32.06 cosmic crisp look at that cosmic crisp that sounds

01:12:36.19 sounds delicious that sounds delicious we could call the episode cosmic crisp

01:12:42.04 when did it come out when did the cosmic crisp release uh yeah I can tell you uh

01:12:46.07 cosmic crisp is an American apple [ __ ]

01:12:49.14 yeah best country in the world with the variety designation wa38

01:12:55.02 breeding began in 1997

01:12:56.19 at the Washington state university tree fruit research and extension center in

01:13:02.14 wenatchee Wisconsin uh Washington initially oversee who cares uh so 97

01:13:07.06 they started waiting no no no there's no there's more recent

01:13:11.06 apples than that that's when they began that's when breeding began that doesn't

01:13:15.16 necessarily okay that's when they finished it it was

01:13:19.09 first planted for commercial use in the spring of 2017.

01:13:23.02 See 2017. We got a new apple within the last

01:13:26.00 five years yeah yeah I've never gone to a grocery store and seen a sign being

01:13:31.12 like this apple just dropped like come try this apple we're excited about

01:13:36.11 this apple just dropped is great it's amazing it's amazing that we haven't

01:13:40.07 heard more about cosmic crisp which sounds like a weed flavor by the way

01:13:44.04 listen to this promotion and marketing a 10

01:13:47.22 million dollar consumer launch of the product was funded by Washington state

01:13:53.06 agricultural promotion funds through the Washington apple commission

01:13:58.04 there is something called the Washington apple commission and they did a 10

01:14:02.09 million dollar promotional and marketing campaign for the goal for the cosmic

01:14:06.04 crisp I never [ __ ] heard crazy because that's a crowded market the

01:14:10.21 apple game yeah apple games [ __ ] it is

01:14:12.21 it's hard to get in amongst the big dogs yeah

01:14:16.11 I wonder like how does that work can I go to a grocery store and find a what

01:14:21.04 was it oh cosmic cosmic crystal whatever new apple launch that lasts for a year

01:14:25.11 that's part of its strength is that it sits on shelves for a long time

01:14:29.06 okay so it doesn't that sounds like a great apple it's like it's well I think

01:14:32.16 we need to try to find a cosmic crisp it is a crossbreed of the honey crisp and

01:14:38.10 the enterprise oh my god we have gotten really scrump heavy without even

01:14:41.23 trying we've got like a weekly apple news we've become like an apple podcast

01:14:47.18 this is interesting it's just something I don't understand I

01:14:50.12 feel like there'd be a lot of enthusiasm for a new fruit type and they just like

01:14:55.22 crazy though there's a newer apple than the company

01:14:58.09 that's a newer apple yeah oh there's so many I feel like red delicious came out

01:15:02.11 in like 2002 and people love that apple I wonder if anybody who's a comment

01:15:07.02 leaver or anybody who just listens to this podcast who wouldn't mind leaving a

01:15:10.12 comment if any of you work or know somebody who works with the Washington

01:15:14.16 apple commission I would love to know what your job is like apparently cosmic
