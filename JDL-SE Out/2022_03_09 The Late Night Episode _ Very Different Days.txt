00:00:59.16 sleep until Andrew we can talk about that later [Music]

00:01:07.16 I don't think I'm delirious I'm just more the joy of I don't think I've ever

00:01:13.08 without a doubt heard Gavin be annoyed yes yes yes we don't have to fake it

00:01:20.23 gab you sound like you're in a bad mood I'm gonna I'm in a bad mood I'm in a

00:01:26.01 shitty little [ __ I mood what uh what do you attribute

00:01:31.03 that to oh well I've been filming all day uh and I got I get home from these

00:01:37.03 little filming sessions and that's let's be fair I'm out of practice I haven't

00:01:41.14 been filming with dan in like two years we're hitting it hard we're back at it

00:01:46.13 I got home about 930

00:01:49.11 and I ate food and I was falling asleep like over my bowl

00:01:53.11 I was so tired I thought wow I don't think I've been this tired so early

00:01:58.04 in two years like this could be the night that I get an early night reset my

00:02:03.11 entire sleep system and I just staring at the stupid calendar invite

00:02:09.18 that's over like almost two hours away and I'm just staying up

00:02:14.19 killing time waiting for time to pass so

00:02:17.05 I can do this and then frickin go to bed so I can wake up early and do it again

00:02:21.12 tomorrow so why are we this time like I know I know

00:02:25.03 why the premise of the early show because I thought it was really funny

00:02:30.19 yeah well it is we have for the audience just in case you didn't listen to the

00:02:34.20 last episode we had a full we needed to cram a bunch of episodes in before Gavin

00:02:39.08 went out of town so we got into a fight and we ended up for some reason agreeing

00:02:44.10 to record two episodes in one day but one of them had to be early in the

00:02:47.13 morning and the other one had to be at the end

00:02:50.00 of the day so we recorded one at 800 am our time and then one at 11 p.m on our

00:02:53.21 time and then we all worked full days except for Andrew who had to write 20

00:02:59.12 000 things today also Gavin could I just commiserate with you uh

00:03:04.04 I uh you know today was my first my first covet free day right I tested

00:05:34.04 [ __ ] asses kicked let me turn that off okay uh

00:05:38.22 difference between a flag and a banner this is I'm doing this at 1130 at night

00:05:45.16 I so don't give a [ __ ] oh get Andrew you might be on to something my friend

00:05:52.19 flags are usually flown on a flagpole or at a 45 degree angle from the side of

00:05:58.00 the structure banners have a pole sleeve him on the top the flag slips over the

00:06:03.03 pole banners are displayed at a 90

00:06:05.17 degrees so we're selling banners we're selling flags we're celebrating we're

00:06:09.18 not actually selling flags so don't put this on a pole hang it from the side of

00:06:14.19 your castle do not you can only hang it from the from the top of the td garden

00:06:18.08 like it's a blurry bird's number huh 45

00:06:20.21 degree yeah oh the pole is 45. Yeah yeah okay not the so who's got a wonky flag.

00:06:25.23 [Laughter]

00:06:28.00 I don't know when I should get into this list thing let's get into the

00:06:32.12 hold on before we do that though I I want to find out what Eric and nick have

00:06:35.12 been up to for the last day that's a great question uh well I had face jam so

00:06:40.01 face jam nick also had face jam that's all you did

00:06:44.02 I mean I mean I had other meetings and stuff but it was huh yeah face jam

00:06:48.22 decent all right sweet oh nick's sake oh yeah baby baby baby

00:06:53.18 I uh I did something today what did you do was it tooth related uh no no well I

00:06:59.07 did tell them that about I had a uh today was a roller coaster of pain and uh

00:07:05.11 I hit a real I think you really want to run here we were doing pleasantries

00:07:10.12 earlier I hit a uh I hit a I hit a low point today at about two in

00:07:15.03 the afternoon where I wanted to uh knock my tooth out with an ice skate

00:07:20.02 like in castaway but uh I [ __ ] fought through it

00:07:23.18 and then I was fine after that for a little while it just like it came in

00:07:28.08 waves it just decided to be particularly painful for about a half hour uh I went

00:07:33.12 to the store today now that I can leave the house again

00:07:38.23 and uh I uh I bought a new bicycle oh what yeah

00:07:42.21 just like a normal bike or no dude

00:07:45.16 another exploding battery mic no this one it's not gonna explode I spent I

00:07:50.21 spent enough money that it will never explode and uh it was everyday I spent

00:07:56.05 like refrigerator money on this thing I don't get it till may till end of may

00:08:01.04 because of supply chain issues but when I do yeah uh sorry smell

00:08:08.13 smash film no I bought a from a company called trek uh and uh I uh yeah but it's

00:08:14.17 got like a 140 mile range on it and they swear to me it'll never break down so

00:08:21.03 I don't know if they can make that guarantee I said [ __ ] it at 30 at 436.

00:08:26.03 What 46 years old I deserve it especially all the the hell

00:08:30.08 that I've been going through with my other I've been going through so much

00:08:35.01 hell on my other e-bike I lost 10 years of my life somehow for a minute there uh

00:08:40.17 at 46 years old I deserve to I just splurged a little bit most dudes buy

00:08:43.22 like motorcycles or rvs or convertibles of this page I spent convertible money

00:08:49.05 on a bicycle so what makes this bike so much better

00:08:52.12 than the last one you had well outside of the fact it won't explode apparently

00:08:57.20 it's got a it's got a bosch engine in it uh like uh that's

00:09:01.14 way more powerful and way sturdier than the one I have it's the battery

00:09:07.20 uh capacity is six times as large uh it's carbon fiber so it's lighter

00:09:12.23 than my bike and it's got a like these top of the line shimono breaks

00:09:18.12 and uh really really nice gear system it's uh it's like top everything top of

00:09:23.16 the line so top of the line that I can't have it for like five months

00:09:28.02 are you excited yeah and someday I'm gonna write this I

00:09:31.04 hope I still want it in five months well I think I think it will because it's

00:09:34.23 your gateway to happiness it's gonna be my gateway to happiness yeah yeah

00:09:38.12 so I just have to suffer through the other one I can't wait to hear about the

00:09:41.20 first trip same same thing go ahead you go ahead how about that no

00:09:46.17 I was just going to say that was that was weird isn't it

00:09:52.17 like polite but with confidence yeah no it didn't come across as

00:09:57.10 confidence I came across I didn't come across I've lost.

00:10:05.18 I don't even remember what I was going to ask now I was so taken aback by your

00:10:11.12 no you go ahead it was authoritative you go because I don't remember I

00:10:16.08 genuinely don't remember what I was gonna [Laughter]

00:10:31.09 probably I think I was gonna ask yeah probably I was first talking about the

00:10:36.00 bike yeah I remembered did we ever talk about

00:10:39.12 Geoff's real bike that he got one time when I still lived with him

00:10:43.21 I don't think so no he went out got he went on a new bike and uh

00:10:48.08 he brought it back and I was he was like yeah he was telling me about his bike

00:10:52.13 he's oh nicely bright shiny and I was like

00:10:55.01 I was like huh a bit on the nose with the uh

00:10:58.17 the color scheme black and green right achievement hunter and Geoff just

00:11:04.02 Geoff was like oh and he just stared it was like oh [ __ ]

00:11:08.13 and uh that was the last time I rode that bike after a few

00:11:13.07 after a few years I gave it away it's like an 800 achievement on a bike

00:11:17.22 basically after I saw it I could never get on it again it was so goddamn

00:11:25.01 offensively on the nose I looked like I was driving a billboard for my [ __ ]

00:11:30.08 website around took about a thousand yard stash

00:11:37.11 that was a nice bike too somewhere what color is this bike that

00:11:41.18 you just bought you know yeah you know right you didn't do it again did you

00:11:46.19 yeah it's uh it's it's green with black accents

00:11:50.12 yeah it's all no no it's like a kind of like a gunmetal like a carbon fiber

00:11:56.08 color it's kind of like a grayish oh that sounds cool yeah it's nice I think

00:11:59.15 gunmetal might be on my list

00:12:03.14 that's the thing that is the thing all right same thing

00:12:19.07 uh what did I add you said Geoff said I gotta scroll for a minute you said

00:12:25.14 Geoff said bosh Geoff said bosh and that's the that's the

00:12:30.04 name of a tv show on amazon that's the thing I forgot about that put on the

00:12:35.04 list without the c uh yeah well I'm just smelling the name of

00:12:38.10 the show it's just maybe hearing bosh made me think of but you could also put

00:12:42.00 in bosch like the company I don't oh yeah I guess I could I just thought of

00:12:46.19 the show thanks Gavin and to the list that's my new bike someday oh

00:12:52.21 damn pretty huh yeah right so so so yeah we've we've gone through what we've all

00:12:59.04 been doing Andrew how was your last 14

00:13:01.09 hours yeah because you couldn't you didn't

00:13:04.18 sleep last night because you were scared you were gonna over you were gonna

00:13:09.02 sleep yeah and miss the morning podcast so you've just been up for like 400

00:13:13.20 hours so I'm gonna I'm just gonna I'm gonna copy and paste this unfortunately

00:13:17.07 what I use the numbers do not come with the document I'd have to like export the

00:13:23.11 document I think but I thought you used a Google doc we couldn't see numbers no

00:13:28.21 no I didn't end up using a Google doc I went I did something else why I used

00:13:34.04 like eric's already mad because I could okay this is why when I hit enter on

00:13:38.02 this one it goes to the next number automatically it already writes it

00:13:41.11 that's what you figured that'd be that's what I want and that's I figured

00:13:44.20 would be a big time saver so that's why I did it on this Google doc I don't

00:13:48.09 think that's what Google doc can do it's just a list you just start a list well

00:13:52.15 wait wait a second how do I let me go back to it let me go back to the one I

00:13:56.08 made earlier titled spreadsheet he's gonna delete it

00:13:59.09 no I'm not gonna delete it so I've vin diesel chimpanzee spelled with a j let's

00:14:03.11 try this uh what's the thing somebody name a thing banana banana okay well my

00:14:09.02 computer has to load oh my god okay here we go

00:14:12.14 b-a-n-a-n-a Eric and nick could go get it in the chat with things we've seen

00:14:18.19 dog rap mouse cats sunglasses okay okay this was listen

00:14:22.19 that's my mistake that is my mistake I didn't know the spreadsheet worked that

00:14:28.23 way oh my we've told you it was no you told me in the blitz you told me when I

00:14:34.06 was blitzed I was caught off guard Eric did did you tell him 100 percent said

00:14:39.06 what to do what to click yeah how to do it and what

00:14:43.17 the expectation was what was very early for me Eric was also like let's be very

00:14:49.06 clear I remember that part I'm gonna over explain this so there's no

00:14:53.20 confusion because because it's not over explaining on this

00:14:57.14 [ __ ] show it's explaining the regulation amount what if I screens hot this

00:15:05.20 copy and paste it and it will and it would insert new numbers for you maybe

00:15:10.23 okay how would I do that what do you mean copy

00:15:14.04 yeah I understand copy and paste what to wear to the uh

00:15:19.11 I don't think it would make numbers I think it would just be one giant thing

00:15:22.13 if I moved to the spreadsheet we're just going to copy and paste

00:15:25.13 we're going to start here we'll do we'll do my first 40. You can

00:15:30.10 tell me what you think tell me what you think of this first 40.48 out of 12 uh

00:15:36.10 2020000. So we're gonna do 20000 in increments of 40. Here we go this is 40.

00:15:42.12 Oh this is the first 40. Okay we started we started with vin diesel these are

00:15:46.16 vin diesel I felt like I did pretty good with vin diesel movies I felt like I

00:15:51.22 stretched vin diesel pretty far vin diesel xxx knock around guy saving

00:15:56.11 private Ryan triplex two you went back to triplex I like it after two movies

00:16:01.18 dude you're back in triple x he's just going in order he I think he [ __ ] did

00:16:07.18 mtv movie awards that's a triple that's a vin diesel

00:16:10.09 thing vin diesel's connected to the aegis wing you're doing video games too

00:16:14.11 these like did he voice voice actors so this is this is what happened this is as

00:16:19.01 soon as we just paced his imdb no I didn't I wrote everything all of the vin

00:16:23.15 diesels from memory wow all vin diesel things from Memphis so you

00:16:27.15 remembered something called three on three freestyle from memory no listen

00:16:33.03 this is what happened we're gonna get there so I remembered up until fast and

00:16:38.21 furious because there's two of this right uh uh

00:16:42.11 so there's a bunch of them but I couldn't remember the subtitle

00:16:46.12 for the video game so I went into I own it though so I

00:16:50.17 opened up my games library and all of the next like 700 are all the

00:16:56.17 games in my digital games library for Xbox that's what these all are three on

00:17:02.04 three freestyle 6180 in the moon nine monkeys of shallow and freshly frosted

00:17:07.16 prototype aegis wing Agatha christie the abc murders

00:17:10.07 because I I figured I'm not go ogling I'm

00:17:12.18 not breaking that rule and it's I didn't think that it was any different than me

00:17:16.21 like going into a library and looking at titles age of booty is actually a good

00:17:20.14 game Eric it's a it's a top-down pirate game it was uh it was actually developed

00:17:25.18 yeah that's pretty popular yeah uh so the next the next I would how do I

00:17:31.03 what was that 45

00:17:32.22 well I don't know because there's no numbers on it where are we at Ellen

00:17:37.22 wakes america tonight 19000 let's go let's see if we could go

00:17:41.04 because there's a 60 to go there's a limit on discord for how many characters

00:17:50.13 all look at with only let's try to go only

00:18:46.23 reverse catamaran yeah it's a great game uh

00:18:50.12 no this is jack's gonna love this he's gonna think it's great I can't wait to

00:18:54.06 see jack's view of this list so at this

00:18:57.17 point even souls no I never I don't well that's a PlayStation right or was that

00:19:01.12 on Xbox are you exclusive Xbox here I was just yeah mainly Xbox uh so at this

00:19:06.17 point this is where we encountered an issue this is when I fell asleep at my

00:19:11.16 desk this was this is a great fall in the list I I may have greatly

00:19:16.06 overestimated time the time it takes to both write things

00:19:23.07 as well as doing it on no sleep so this is the list the list doesn't stop there

00:19:32.06 we still got where do you how many things do you think I named

00:19:36.15 20 thousand how many uh any point well you just sat there thinking of things

00:19:42.08 though yes okay absolutely I don't think you made it to a thousand I think you

00:19:47.10 named

00:19:49.06 640 things well here's another 100 so we're at 300

00:19:53.20 at this point [Laughter]

00:19:55.21 [Music]

00:19:59.22 Nhl 16 nhl 17 nhl 18

00:20:05.20 one through 13. But here's the thing right you may have you may only own nhl

00:20:11.03 16 through 21. But there were surely nhl games waiting for that

00:20:17.22 yeah but these so there were times where I knew there were more that happens a

00:20:22.12 lot but I couldn't remember their names and I didn't want to Google it I felt

00:20:26.06 that was against the competition I like the idea

00:20:29.11 once you've got doom and then next to it you've got doom because no

00:20:34.09 I didn't include the movie because I'm a [ __ ] idiot that's the reboot of doom

00:20:38.19 was called doom but we talked about this yeah we did you have to have a bracket

00:20:43.14 you have to have parentheses explaining the difference otherwise you could have

00:20:47.07 just written doom doom doom as three different things well I figured we

00:20:50.06 clarified in this moment and that we were all good it didn't need the bracket

00:20:53.12 I didn't have a lot of time I I figured here's another hundred another hundred

00:20:58.06 feet of bruise it's got final fantasy two one through thirteen I I can tell

00:21:03.03 that he wrote I think there will be people who go oh I

00:21:05.21 think he just copied and pasted this look at just cause just cause just cause

00:21:39.11 [ __ ] you to all the people that think I made up the not knowing the shift key

00:21:43.09 and the caps locks thing that is the exact issue I've talked about

00:21:46.23 where I mishit when it was supposed to be up and what was supposed to be down

00:22:54.23 Okay well those so we could we could subtract we got them no we gotta find

00:23:00.02 somebody we're talking about in five nhl games no no the doom is fine because

00:23:04.19 they're different you've got overcooked in there twice where's overcooked.

00:23:15.05 the the two on overcooked strike one so that no we don't need to strike it

00:23:20.06 it's just it's clarified we got minus five right now

00:23:23.21 when when Andrew has to read this list if we release it it's just gonna be

00:23:28.19 Andrew saying names of video games I didn't even think that he could get

00:23:34.09 he could probably get close to 20000 in his own video game collection

00:23:38.12 no I went through my entire video game collection we're coming up on the end of

00:23:42.21 the video games drop another uh another hundred in here

00:23:45.20 for you I said you got some more some more coming at you some more hot game

00:23:51.07 sniper elite through four solitaire classic game who doesn't love solitaire

00:23:56.22 oh ruby clips thanks man yeah of course great game yeah say it's right out of

00:24:02.19 hell is that a separate game uh yeah it is it was like dlc side game

00:24:08.21 I thought it was just dlc it had his own icon

00:24:12.13 assuming it's its own thing dlc is the thing that's a good point

00:24:16.16 we're not listing games here we're listing things yeah

00:24:20.11 okay so we're almost wrong wow I end more games so we got like a hundred more

00:24:24.19 games and then we've gone out of game territory

00:24:28.00 so I decided to get to just the things you're thinking of

00:24:32.04 so that's where it becomes a difficult because I I fell asleep I passed out how

00:24:37.05 long were you asleep for uh about five hours.

00:24:41.07 I fell asleep at my desk my head on the desk like head on the desk for five

00:24:46.10 hours I woke up I used the bathroom different days

00:24:50.12 like you like you finished the test early and the teacher told you to put

00:24:55.14 your head on your desk and be quiet so I was cruising and I thought you know

00:25:00.17 what I just I I shut down I just shut down I don't even remember falling asleep

00:25:06.02 but I woke up I woke up five hours later got a drink use the bathroom fell back

00:25:11.07 asleep for three more hours it really really ate into my clock

00:25:15.08 it's okay so that's five hours plus three hours

00:25:19.22 and eight hours what was the total [Music]

00:25:23.12 I think it was like 14 hours so we're subtracting 8 from 14. So we're

00:25:28.11 almost done with the games do the next do the next hundred okay so

00:25:32.19 now we are we have left the games officially at this next hundred we can

00:25:37.04 really analyze you can tell me what you think where you go

00:25:40.11 where my brain went you can see some of these have connections some of them do

00:25:43.16 not so we wrap up the games and the very first thing is Vancouver child kicker

00:25:51.07 three things yeah because it's I have the koozie on my desk yeah

00:25:56.10 kaiser soze moment I like that you've gone from games to you can't pluck

00:26:01.12 anything out of your brain you just you're already staring around the room

00:26:06.12 for inspiration yeah barbecue sauce ketchup mustard ranch mayo Disney channel

00:26:12.23 Disney parks Disney company those are all separate things packages flags oh

00:26:17.22 you should put banners ranked games shibata bread johnny bravo how do you

00:26:24.12 like these leaps Dexter labs Scooby-doo teen titan oh my god Doug video games

00:26:31.11 short games pass

00:26:52.12 you get inspiration in a new direction you'll be like oh sorry you'll do like

00:26:57.12 three fruit and then move on to something completely different it's so

00:27:02.23 scattered I love it so this is this is what happened Liam

00:27:06.19 neeson I wasn't confident I would know how to spell qui-gon jinn so I just went

00:27:12.04 Liam neeson didn't trust it oh you had a run of kenny's I did oh my god

00:27:16.17 Kenny rogers Kenny loggins Kenny powers Kenny hotz Kenny from south park kung fu

00:27:22.11 Kinney great Kenny did you rush our reference bring it back to uh Jackie chan

00:27:29.14 okay so now now we'll do the next hundred uh once again none of these none

00:27:35.16 of these are video games yeah is that rumors the album or rumors the thing

00:27:41.14 uh rumors the f album we'll say the okay okay without the album

00:27:47.01 so this is this is the last this is the last of the list

00:27:52.13 this is the end of your list this is the end you suck that's so bad

00:28:00.21 you went back to video games for a while Bruce cherries not games

00:28:08.15 bayonetta bayonetta two bayonetta three characters

00:28:13.16 games dude those are games we went from skyfox online remastered to Chris Pratt

00:28:20.00 seeking uh super Mario movie oh Keegan Michael key jackpot these are all

00:28:26.17 voice actors on the Mario Taylor.

00:28:35.22 Indiana you could have just done all the states

00:28:40.11 that's a free fifty I don't I'm sorry rosemary thyme cherries Nelly [Laughter]

00:28:48.19 ja rule Regis philbin can I ask how you got how you got devil satanic symbols

00:28:56.12 Tristan [Laughter]

00:29:01.04 [Music]

00:29:07.05 Uh Tristan Thompson I was thinking about the trade deadline on Thursday is this

00:29:12.11 traded gurple's a thing is definitely a thing so

00:29:15.22 I may have I may have had some burger confidence in this I may have greatly

00:29:21.11 overestimated I may have fell asleep at my desk eating up most of my time it's

00:29:25.15 my grand total still had but basically if you subtract eight hours from your

00:29:30.12 time you had to you went from having to do 29 a minute to 55 a minute but yeah

00:29:36.06 still you still had I feel like you still wasted all of the hours that you

00:29:41.06 were awake what do you mean I wasted I I what do you mean

00:29:45.11 I thought the video game library idea was a great plan yeah but it almost took

00:29:50.18 me 2000.

00:29:51.22 What now when you leave the video game library that's where it becomes a

00:29:55.22 problem because I can't remember did I talk about john Hughes previously did I

00:30:00.00 talk about satanism that I talk about Tristan

00:30:03.12 Thompson it becomes difficult but this is my commitment because I lost this by

00:30:09.11 a lot I was I was just 19000 shy I'm gonna keep up with this list of

00:30:14.06 things I will name twenty thousand thanks and we'll just see how long it

00:30:19.21 takes so how's this is on this list uh a thousand nine

00:30:24.02 that's not subtracting the five nhl duplicates so a thousand four

00:30:28.17 I was just I was just a slight nineteen thousand short like

00:30:33.09 hey you friend gun the video game and then you've written a gun

00:30:38.06 yeah you know macho man and randy savage

00:30:41.05 as two different things different things

00:30:44.05 yeah one's the character one's the human

00:30:47.14 I'm guessing uh I like that you wrote al horford and then brick uh

00:30:52.04 I I don't know if that's a dig in al horford

00:30:55.07 no wasn't I just immediately thought of the movie brick okay and then the song

00:31:01.05 brick so if you had a guess of what you tried to achieve today

00:31:05.05 and what you actually did it would be at five percent

00:31:10.00 yeah well you know it takes this is as we said going in we didn't know how

00:31:15.05 difficult this would be this is very difficult I'm happy with the list I have

00:31:20.17 I'm going to continue to build off this list I will do 20000 thanks

00:31:24.06 and we'll just see how it goes I think well I'm not even going to set a

00:31:27.09 timeline that'd be dumb I made to declare when this will be done but I am

00:31:31.04 going to be actively working on this list and I'll let you guys know when I

00:31:35.09 have 20000 things and then I'll I'll read it out or am I reading out the

00:31:38.19 thousand I think it'd be funny to have like a six hour you're gonna read out 20

00:31:43.02 000 things yeah okay yeah now's your opportunity to transfer it to the Google

00:31:46.15 doc and continue in there yeah and in the meantime I'll uh just turn my

00:31:50.11 printer off I think we should still print it I don't think you have to print

00:31:53.12 it but we should print it I just I'm curious how many two like two thousand

00:31:57.00 thing twenty thousand can you just not print it during a record is that okay

00:32:01.00 can you just yeah that's fine okay just making sure no I've learned my lesson I

00:32:06.08 learned my lesson from the law it won it's a very one-sided battle [Applause]

00:35:00.20 ad you might need to edit that out nick bye so that was my day I fell asleep at

00:35:04.09 my desk and then I wrote I wrote this list the fact that I only had five

00:35:08.14 duplicates I feel like I should get a little bit that was noticed

00:35:13.11 yeah that we noticed I feel like you guys are pretty thorough

00:35:17.04 in your breakdown of this list what do you think jack will think any of

00:35:22.06 this means yeah I don't know what jack's gonna do with this I don't know

00:35:26.19 I felt like I was in the pitch meeting for we didn't start the fire that's how

00:35:31.11 I felt which I should have put on this list and

00:35:34.23 you could have just gone down that list well I don't the Marilyn Monroe is

00:35:39.20 because of that but I didn't put anything else

00:35:44.04 so Marilyn Monroe somewhere on this list so that was my day I'm honestly

00:35:49.20 so you slept all day just well no part of the day and then and then I

00:35:54.22 wrote this list you did a lot more sleeping than list writing

00:36:00.15 he named he named a thousand things he's supposed to get to 20000. He went

00:36:05.18 that's my day and you just went so you slept all day.

00:36:19.08 [Laughter]

00:36:23.22 I'm not going to blame anybody

00:36:29.09 hear me out hear me out started very early in the morning

00:36:33.18 started very early on these recordings the book end was very early for me

00:36:39.12 I think with a lack of a normal sleep schedule

00:36:42.21 I think you're seeing at least five to six times the amount of things on that

00:36:48.03 list do you remember when he started the day saying that he felt sharp he was

00:36:52.22 like a sharpened knife he was ready and then he slept for eight hours

00:36:58.08 do you remember do you remember by the end of the episode

00:37:02.06 and saying it was a dull blade I was I was clear I didn't he missed he lost

00:37:07.11 we lost some steam oh so if you had done five to six times

00:37:11.05 better that would have put you in the 25

00:37:14.06 to 30 range yeah it's you know I honestly I just

00:37:18.19 don't have the ability to type that fast

00:37:21.16 he wasted half of the hours he was awake

00:37:25.11 poorly transcribing video games from one place to the other

00:37:28.07 how was the experience was it as miserable as I hope it was yeah it was

00:37:32.15 not good there was no joy in the transcription of any of that and it's

00:37:36.19 just gonna get worse yeah so if you're five percent of the way through and

00:37:42.12 you're out of video games well I'm out of games I own

00:37:46.15 I could go into a best buy and really shake things up

00:37:50.04 just just think of different things it's all in your brain

00:37:54.10 you have all the effects I will I'm gonna get there I'm gonna get there I

00:37:59.03 definitely am gonna get there it's just it didn't happen today

00:38:02.12 early recording really it really took a lot oh next girl good question did you

00:38:06.17 add mcdonald's when you did because that

00:38:08.12 was the meal you had at that moment that is factually correct

00:38:13.18 that is that is absolutely did you right fall cakes [ __ ] nailed

00:38:19.14 it nick no but I thought of the hack I had a nice 10 piece value chicken nugget

00:38:24.23 meal yeah did you put hot cakes and hack on your list

00:38:29.07 I definitely put hot kicks okay I don't know if I put hack all this laughing is

00:38:35.05 making my [ __ ] mouth hurt oh god damn.

00:38:40.15 I'm excited I don't know one day out of the way it's gonna be like well because

00:38:45.23 I've started this journey and I'm going to get to 20000 things

00:38:49.15 and one day I'll be like hey I did I finally did the thing but they impressed

00:38:52.23 me how long it takes would have been to have done it in a day that was the thing

00:38:56.15 you were bragging about well and I wasn't named 20000 things it between

00:38:59.20 now and the end of their life yeah you're going to name one thing for 20

00:39:03.16 000 days and then give us a list I'm not going for impressive I'm just

00:39:08.10 saying we'll know how long it actually took me

00:39:11.16 I was incorrect in stating I could easily do it

00:39:14.17 well once again a day in which I didn't sleep most of I would have done a lot

00:39:19.19 more damage to this list

00:39:23.01 yes 6000 had you not spent the morning in a

00:39:27.14 tub and the afternoon face down on your desk yes yes yes idea okay

00:39:34.04 I think I could have hit five thousand twenty thousand was never gonna happen

00:39:39.14 well why don't we just why don't you just do five thousand tomorrow then

00:39:43.21 now I'm doing that we're doing the break

00:39:45.20 [ __ ] tomorrow oh yeah for an hour and a half that's like a third of your nap

00:39:51.01 time that's but no but I get I get so stressed doing anything live I'm gonna

00:39:56.10 be [ __ ] sleepy as soon as we're done with that

00:39:58.18 it takes I get I get nervous I get nervous doing the break [ __ ] how you

00:40:03.11 don't have to do anything you're just a voice

00:40:05.21 no but I I'm trying to like add I don't want to feel

00:40:09.06 I feel like you you don't like I don't want to just be dead weight yeah yeah

00:40:13.12 no I appreciate that that's true and it's a live performance I'm trying to

00:40:16.21 like be invested in it and it's because it's it's the only live thing I do I

00:40:20.15 find it stressful yeah and it's a lot better than it was when I started but I

00:40:24.12 typically find I'm drained earlier than I normally would on a standard

00:40:28.13 regulation day that's totally fair that's totally fair I won't criticize

00:40:31.18 Friday on the other hand I don't think we have anything for the show on Friday

00:40:34.18 we're doing one on Thursday Friday I don't know okay we'll see I'm not

00:44:32.23 I would like to go back to the bit where I said let's just talk about this no

00:44:38.03 I want this on the podcast because somehow I don't come across as the

00:44:42.21 dumbest one here in this recording somehow you have

00:44:45.22 taken that mantle this is insane so we're done after this we're not I'm

00:44:50.07 not going to see you're going to be a different human being the next time we

00:44:58.22 it's just we don't need it this will cover us it'll cover my absence okay

00:45:02.21 that's fine that's fine we can play hey let's find it's too late I'd love to

00:45:06.05 play halo what if you get quarantined or something maybe we should have an extra

00:45:10.12 one in the bag yeah see what no that's up to the producer uh

00:45:15.11 hey guys let's talk about it after.

00:45:20.15 Eric why don't I just slack you all of my because

00:45:24.02 this is actually it's annoying for you it's very annoying for me that when my

00:45:28.17 dates change on me so I'll just keep you up to date on slack outside of content

00:45:33.05 because I yeah I assume all right it's annoying for you it's annoying for me

00:45:36.13 it's gotta be the most annoying for the audience to have to listen to this shite

00:45:40.22 I have to keep you informed in slack I think there are so many people that love

00:45:46.04 it but yes please keep me informed on slack

00:45:50.00 that's all I need but again we can talk about this app okay

00:45:54.10 I'm so excited to go to bed I'm so excited it's gonna be so comfy

00:45:57.23 are we so warm how old you're not gonna be able to go to sleep you're gonna be

00:46:01.20 seeing through your eyelids again yeah how long do you think it's gonna take

00:46:05.17 you to fall asleep oh I'm gonna be amped for at least an hour afterwards yeah

00:46:10.02 you're gonna gonna be going through my [ __ ] list double checking making sure

00:46:13.08 going through the airs well if you're gonna be all amped up for another hour

00:46:18.02 let's just do another podcast no

00:46:21.03 no we're not it's a terrible idea Andrew how long is it gonna take you to

00:46:26.11 fall asleep oh I'm gonna be up until like 5 am now my sleep schedule is [ __ ]

00:46:32.09 it's so bad today I imagine either that or you will fall asleep on your

00:46:36.10 microphone if I could if I could get into the channel for the

00:46:41.00 break [ __ ] stream I would be there for pleasantries as soon as we're done I'd

00:46:44.09 just be waiting did you have live feed of an empty studio did you have qwerty

00:46:48.12 written backwards on your forehead when you woke up.

00:46:52.13 [Laughter]

00:46:57.17 [Music]

00:47:01.16 Have you ever had keys on your keyboard stop working

00:47:06.08 uh yes of course how did you solve that got a new keyboard yeah that is smart I

00:47:11.18 had a laptop that I think the y and the t didn't work and so whenever I wanted

00:47:17.01 to use those letters I'd have to copy and paste from a news story and put it in

00:47:22.15 and I thought I don't use these letters all that you use them a lot you don't

00:47:25.15 realize how often you use certain letters until you have to copy and paste

00:47:29.08 them anytime you want to put a message in yeah it's almost like I was playing

00:47:33.00 wordle in advance like I was trying to find alternate words for what I was

00:47:36.21 trying to say during that time it was an interesting challenge I lost this was

00:47:42.17 back when I was on msn messenger back in the day I lost g on my keyboard and I

00:47:47.02 had to tell my friends that I would be using nine instead of g and I actually

00:47:51.11 got pretty good at just going to nine subconsciously

00:47:54.15 and then when I got a new keyboard I kept doing it it was pretty annoying I

00:47:57.21 had to sort of tr unlearn that why nine it looks like a g does it well yeah

00:48:02.21 lower case g it's better than like a seven or

00:48:06.02 something I would not say if I saw the g and a nine at a bbq I wouldn't assume

00:48:11.16 they were related I'm not saying it is it it is a g it's a nine it's just it's

00:48:17.05 it you can read it as a g if you want hmm

00:48:19.12 well what do you at that point couldn't uh I guess I guess I see you're saying

00:48:24.15 like a two would be weird would it to Evan navin

00:48:29.07 I don't see how navin is different it looks like a g man

00:48:33.01 it doesn't really though I just did a g and a nine no I just did

00:48:37.12 that does not look like Gavin you cannot tell me that looks like Gavin

00:48:42.19 they're enough no it doesn't and your whole argument of if you decide it's a g

00:48:48.20 can be applied to literally anything if we just decide anything is achieved

00:48:54.04 nine is similar is more similar to another letter dude come on look at that

00:48:59.09 it's an open loop g that's a nine that one you know what I'm

00:49:03.02 not going to argue that one that one did you forget how to write a g well no I'm

00:49:08.08 I mean I'm looking at the g it's just the nine is different yeah up close

00:49:13.14 seeing it up close yeah the discord g is a closed loop g it's a weird g

00:49:18.10 that's that's where it went went wrong for me I feel like I feel like you don't

00:49:23.22 you shouldn't come too hard at the two guys that have the first letter their

00:49:28.02 name is the g yeah we know g pretty well no we know

00:49:31.14 our way around the g and we're both gemini that's true it's [ __ ] g

00:49:36.13 squared up here we're both knight nine eminem [Laughter]

00:49:43.14 why did you do that while I was drinking

00:49:47.11 how's Henry doing he's sleeping on a Henry update because he's basically

00:49:53.00 we're missing before his awake time and after his

00:49:57.04 bedtime today he uh he already he already has his diaper on and whenever

00:50:02.04 when he puts his diaper on he loses his bones and then he becomes a floppy thing

00:50:07.19 and he uh he just sprawls out and so he uh he's he doesn't have any bones right

00:50:13.22 now huh I'm trying to think go for it well what

00:50:16.15 well it's tough I'm just I'm trying to think it's tough can just be the end of

00:50:20.08 the sentence but Gavin with a nine so you would you ever would you come

00:50:25.09 with the same conclusion Geoff with the nine

00:50:28.09 yeah if I had to substitute a g I would pick him nine or a six what about an a I

00:50:33.14 feel left out we got a number like I might do this

00:50:36.02 six you went with the six six yeah like that looks six probably

00:50:40.21 more like an uppercase g than a nine looks like a g yeah I should have done

00:50:46.19 six look I was probably 12.

00:50:49.05 [Laughter]

00:50:51.09 Yeah four is a great one for a yeah that's a great alternative

00:50:56.02 a great a alternative if you've been looking for an

00:51:00.02 alternative a in your life let me suggest you the four

00:51:03.18 why did we do this I don't know I what are we talking about

00:51:08.03 you asked if you ever lost a key on your

00:51:11.16 keyboard no I meant this show in general this this late this is a terrible idea

00:51:15.21 92 episodes and you're asking why we did this show in general no just this

00:51:20.08 specific episode not this show in general there's exciting things

00:51:23.12 happening with with the show in general we're doing animated stuff I don't know

00:51:27.01 if I should talk about that yet yeah go for it we're starting to do an animated

00:51:31.15 version of this I guess we'll pick your head today it was a good head wow

00:51:36.09 it was a good head I like the head when Gavin comes back

00:51:40.16 from his trip we'll start our new show uh does it do as well I believe we'll

00:51:45.01 get that do we have that do we have that scheduled in

00:51:48.00 do you have to talk to the producer he said I just found out when you were

00:51:52.04 going so no [Music]

00:51:53.18 all right I deserve that could we ask the audience maybe for like

00:51:59.09 what would be great segments from the podcast to animate like what would

00:52:03.17 convert that's a great idea I think I'm trying to think of

00:52:07.18 things if you make the if there's a topic on the subreddit uh there's a face

00:52:11.12 subreddit uh then I would say probably make a post there and then have people

00:52:15.03 link with like times and go oh I love this part that probably really helps

00:52:19.09 that is a great idea all right I think that the child kick is the ultimate one

00:52:23.14 to do that's a pretty good that is that is one to eventually do now

00:52:27.22 how are you gonna animate that's a that's an entire film that's a feature

00:52:31.07 like yeah yeah talking about like not feeling like you're contributing to an

00:52:36.21 episode I don't think I'd love to know the word count for Gavin and I in the go

00:52:40.19 now episode it has to be under 25 for both of us that's a masterclass in

00:52:45.06 storytelling it was just such a good story yeah it's it's I think the

00:52:48.22 greatest story I will ever hear well I'm

00:52:50.20 never telling it again so I'm glad I got it both in the content

00:52:55.18 and the delivery of it you you did great writing the donkey story oh when I rode

00:53:00.21 the horse down the mountain yeah oh yeah okay

00:53:06.15 Geoff bike break yeah it would be interesting to take me choking the

00:53:11.10 choking noises I've made throughout this show and just without context have

00:53:15.15 people try to like draw what they think happened or where that came from

00:53:20.07 should we play a game next week called guess the choke and we just you play one

00:53:24.02 from each event and we have to guess what was in your mouth I love that idea

00:53:30.04 do we care about copyright strikes on our YouTube channel I was thinking about

00:53:35.13 the Jurassic park thing that Gavin made the other day well we don't monetize

00:53:40.12 well put on Instagram yeah okay that works

00:53:43.17 that was not like six months ago at this point it was yeah it just

00:53:47.16 popped in my head when I was thinking of things that was the thing that six

00:53:51.01 months is nothing it took us a year to make a [ __ ] port a potty mug that's

00:53:55.02 true where are we at on the ground uh I don't know Eric do you know where we are

00:53:58.17 on the ground tubes I remember back to the drawing board for a while uh no I

00:54:02.08 don't I have I don't have an update for that right now uh I can find out

00:54:05.13 tomorrow and let you guys know yeah I guess it's probably too late to find out

00:54:08.20 right now yeah it's it's almost tomorrow

00:54:10.23 so just give me you know a little bit of

00:54:13.00 time give you another 10 minutes yeah it could be tomorrow I have a is there

00:54:17.04 anything that you need to do that you've been putting off you just keep

00:54:20.10 forgetting about I need to get my [ __ ] tooth drilled you're not

00:54:23.11 forgetting about that you almost bought a [ __ ] ice skate and knocked it out

00:54:27.00 yourself earlier today that's frequent your mind what about you Gavin was the

00:54:32.00 last time you're like oh [ __ ] that is a

00:54:34.19 thing I need to do um or do you have one Geoff

00:54:37.04 uh I had one today that is ridiculous what is yours I have a bed frame still

00:54:42.06 on my patio it's been there it's been there for like

00:54:45.17 20 days at this point whenever I swap beds it's it's when I put it out there

00:54:50.17 and that's your balcony or is it on the ground yeah yeah it's like no it's all

00:54:55.10 my balcony it's just taking up my balcony space and I need to get rid of

00:54:58.20 it but I keep forgetting it exists throw it off your balcony isn't it covered in

00:55:03.12 snow uh I don't I don't know the condition of it we just had uh people

00:55:08.01 just moved in uh to the unit next to me which has been vacant for a long time

00:55:12.05 and uh I had a funny panic moment last night where I could hear talking and I

00:55:17.16 couldn't figure out if it was coming from the people in the unit next door or

00:55:22.04 if it was outside because sometimes you can hear fighting and arguments going on

00:55:25.13 outside my window so I was like I'm gonna check this out even though I

00:55:29.06 was curious is it people next door is it outside I never process what if it is

00:55:33.06 people next door I opened my door and immediately saw the outline of people

00:55:37.01 and panicked and shut the door immediately I never considered and I

00:55:40.18 just I wondered what their from their perspective what that must have been

00:55:44.23 like to hear the door open and immediately slam shut again and I assume

00:55:49.07 you weren't wearing pants oh no absolutely not as in my underwear as I

00:55:53.22 was just getting ready I was expecting to hear a fight I have a question about

00:55:58.00 your bed out there okay does it block your view of women pissing in the alley

00:56:03.12 oh that's well first of all I'm not I'm not looking for that

00:56:07.23 second of all you're not not looking no I'm not I'm actively not that was.

00:56:13.01 [Music]

00:56:14.04 That was the unfortunate thing that I witnessed [Laughter]

00:56:19.07 but no it's not I could you know what here I'll uh I'll

00:56:23.16 take a photo of it right now by all means please hell yeah I uh

00:56:28.17 I'm not mad at you for this but uh I'm not happy with you Gavin

00:56:33.07 for this episode yeah I'm so [ __ ]

00:56:35.16 tired I've dead in the last like eight minutes with my eyes closed I just

00:56:40.10 can't it sounded it just sounded so funny at the time it's like when

00:56:45.11 you guys got those idiots on a night out like trying to make plans with you the

00:56:48.13 next day like yeah yeah yeah yeah I have brunch tomorrow it's like you're gonna

00:56:52.05 be asleep you're an idiot you're stupid why bother making I don't know it's the

00:56:56.13 same thing it's like why did we even agree

00:56:58.12 because someone should have just said no

00:57:01.14 no because we're they because that's not facey I know

00:57:04.07 we just we did the trapped ourselves trapped ourselves with the name obvious

00:57:08.21 I enjoyed this episode even though oh me too

00:57:10.20 massively detrimental to my entire week but next to going to sleep next to my

00:57:14.17 girlfriend for the first time in two weeks I can't think of anything I rather

00:57:18.17 would have done tonight other than that so that's my balcony oh it's just like

00:57:23.01 the frame just the frame so you could throw another bet out there

00:57:26.23 and have an outside sleeping I've thought about that I think that's kind

00:57:30.11 of a great idea but I don't know what to buy for that um why is it why do you

00:57:34.21 have what looks like the top of like a police car siren on the oh is it

00:57:40.02 it's a candle speaking of things I forgot about doing

00:57:44.04 that was from I think the first break [ __ ] stream

00:57:47.20 I opened up the waffle air freshener that we sell

00:57:50.10 and it smelled so bad I decided to just throw it in a candle to get to burn it

00:57:55.09 and then I ran outside because it started smoking everywhere

00:57:58.10 and I I'm above I'm right below a smoke alarm

00:58:01.05 so that candle's been there as well it hasn't been moved since I ran outside

00:58:05.07 and I put you're just slowly building a face museum out there.

00:58:10.23 I bet you the waffle is still I'm gonna should I go check to see if the waffles

00:58:16.03 yeah yeah I'm so [ __ ] tired he could def construct that frame nick says

00:58:23.01 yeah but then where's he gonna put the new bed the outside bed

00:58:27.01 is does that mean he just had nothing out there

00:58:30.02 yeah well he did until well now he has a candle and a bed frame before that yeah

00:58:34.17 I think it was it was pretty barren I hope we get to go there one day dude I am

00:58:39.20 very excited to go there I'm gonna [ __ ] hang out I wanna I wanna light

00:58:45.15 waffle bomb candles on that deck nick and Eric are you coming to Canada

00:58:49.11 with us when we go yeah we'd love to we can go crabbing and whatever other ideas

00:58:53.19 you got to have someone hold the camera and nick's got to run audio so I mean

00:58:57.09 that it's the only thing that makes sense no awful unfortunately yeah

00:59:01.22 what happened is that the candle you wrote no different candle for the roast of

00:59:07.07 marshmallow well this is terrible what a great way

00:59:11.11 we're done yeah should we go to bed yeah I think we can stop now
