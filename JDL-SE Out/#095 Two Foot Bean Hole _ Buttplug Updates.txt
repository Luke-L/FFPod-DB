00:00:07.22 [Music]

00:00:10.14 [Applause]

00:00:15.05 Is Gavin going to be one minute late he could be he'll be on oh my god

00:00:21.16 incredible incredible there's a zero percent chance of

00:00:25.20 pleasantries ever occurring which we've been over before I don't

00:00:30.10 want to bring up a good thing but we haven't spoken I haven't talked to

00:00:35.21 Gavin in a in a literal month it's been a month since we talked hey Gavin hi hi

00:00:41.21 this is but yeah I'm surprised I'm good I'm okay I feel a little bloated if I'm

00:00:46.10 gonna be honest I cook french fries a little too late to the recording and I

00:00:49.16 was trying to eat them as quickly as possible because they need to do two of

00:00:52.16 these I also had a disgusting lunch it was awful what was true did you have I

00:00:57.04 was I was panicking I had about 20

00:00:59.02 minutes I had to whip up some soup but also I'm feeling a bit um drowsy so I

00:01:04.11 thought oh I'll get a coffee hot coffee and hot soup absolutely foul I wouldn't

00:01:09.16 recommend it what if you okay here we go combine both

00:01:13.20 put caffeine in the soup yeah caffeinated soup caffeine saved me

00:01:18.15 quite a lot of time oh my god you just didn't oh Andrew can we do caffeinated

00:01:23.12 soup think about it I don't enjoy much think about this oh my god you just

00:01:27.06 saved so much time this this could be uniform I need to I'm going to get on

00:01:31.03 the phone with the uniform hq because this could exist uh

00:01:34.08 what is this heat and yeah I don't whatever that is I don't care uh

00:01:38.09 who cares about bone broth think about it what are the two things you put in

00:01:42.17 thermoses you put hot coffee in a thermos you put soup in a thermos boom I

00:01:46.23 like that Eric just sent us a link immediately establishing that this is

00:01:50.06 real and Geoff just wants to ignore it just pretend it doesn't exist ah I mean

00:01:55.07 that's it's bone broth bone broth isn't a soup it's a it's a component of a soup

00:01:59.08 what is bone broth what is bone broth yeah like what what

00:02:04.21 that's terrible it

00:02:11.03 somebody put soup in a [ __ I coffee machine noodles I did but that was

00:02:20.04 that was a good idea you did it no there's something much grosser about

00:02:25.09 because there's vegetables well I guess there were no the vegetables came in

00:02:31.07 later I don't know I guarantee you this works then they just run hot water

00:02:34.18 through it and it's fine for sure I I guess the question is what else do they

00:02:39.07 do if you're doing that your line of what

00:02:42.11 you're gonna do is not the same as other

00:02:44.21 people I'm curious what other inventions they have

00:02:48.05 not inventions like cooking processes how are you doing Geoff uh I'm good let's

00:02:53.22 do this real fast hello and welcome to another episode of the F**kFuckFacePodcast my

00:02:58.06 name is Geoff Ramsey with as always Andrew panton and uh the other one Gavin

00:03:03.05 free of course nick and Eric are somewhere in

00:03:06.06 the in the background they're being quiet and hilarious in their own rights

00:03:09.15 and we haven't spoken as a trio in exactly a month uh I've spent time with

00:03:14.04 Andrew we invented a product we had to stop talking because it was getting too

00:03:19.16 too podcasty uh spent some physical time with Gavin I'm still sore from it

00:03:24.12 I don't know how you feel but uh we should dive into it uh

00:03:27.22 where do you guys wanna start I wanna know why you're sore what was the

00:03:31.14 physical thing that you two did well was there anything uh that we had planned a

00:03:35.16 month ago Andrew yeah but I don't think that's

00:03:38.13 happened yet the thing I'm thinking of the baseballs no baseballs happened this

00:03:43.11 weekend what is correct oh you guys did the bean hole well we did

00:03:49.18 some of the bean hole

00:03:53.12 that means we dug the hole so you've done none of the bean hole

00:04:01.20 we did a very hard part of the bean hole that's the whole that's exactly half of

00:04:07.21 the work it's in the name yeah I can't b you can't have bean hole without hole

00:04:12.10 that's true but the whole you could do a lot with that hole that hole doesn't

00:04:16.13 have to be a bean hole yet you got options with that hole let me just say

00:04:20.18 before we get into it [ __ ] that hole [ __ ] that hole with everything I have

00:04:25.20 [ __ ] my backyard [ __ ] my back [ __ I the hammer

00:04:30.09 [ __ ] the pry bar that was covered and my hand hurts I got I just have rust

00:04:34.12 embedded in my fingers today Gavin I was making fun of you for whining about not

00:04:37.23 having a glove yesterday but today it's

00:04:40.00 just like my my fingers are on fire [ __ ]

00:04:42.15 the shovel that we bent in half [ __ ] the

00:04:46.19 broken wheelbarrow [ __ ] the giant cinder block we were trying to use [ __ ]

00:04:50.12 Everything today it's your tetanus uh it's up to date I got a technical

00:04:54.17 last year nice yeah I'm good I'm good are there any photos of this I'd love to

00:04:59.08 see your broken [ __ ] wheelbarrow and your brick like this is I don't

00:05:03.05 understand how there's a better coverage of this event oh there's coverage

00:05:06.17 there's coverage to see it you want to see coverage oh I want to see covered so

00:05:10.14 badly did we decide if I share my screen can you hear it was that not a thing oh

00:05:14.18 no it was absolutely a thing we did but I don't remember the results of it there

00:05:18.13 was a problem I think I don't think we could well because it was the slow-mo

00:05:22.16 video right with uh Geoff on the bike the bike yeah we tried it then I don't

00:05:28.06 doesn't matter whatever what if I send it to Eric and Eric can figure it out

00:05:33.05 while I do the uh talking part of face that sounds great that sounds like a

00:05:38.15 good plan oh fun sure also I'll say uh we uh before we get into it

00:05:43.16 any further uh I will say we didn't complete the bean hole I mean first off

00:05:47.11 you can't complete it in one day it's a multi-day thing but uh there were a few

00:05:53.05 mitigating factors that made us stop a one physical exhaustion

00:05:56.17 two uh I have to go out of town tomorrow for the day and I didn't want to leave

00:06:01.12 my yard on fire and be be on a road trip that seemed irresponsible especially I

00:06:06.22 believe there's like Texas has like a permanent burn ban going on at all times

00:06:10.11 so I just I just didn't want to come home to a pile of rubble or a

00:06:13.20 neighborhood on fire uh however I we haven't talked about

00:06:17.08 this with you yet Eric I don't think or nick but I think Gavin and I decided

00:06:21.22 after we dug the hole since we're gonna be hitting baseballs all afternoon on

00:06:27.07 Sunday anyway wouldn't it be great if to

00:06:31.03 to uh to celebrate all the 350 dingers I hit

00:06:33.04 uh come on I'm back to Geoff's house and we can all eat some beans together yeah

00:06:37.18 that sounds fun Gavin and I were thinking

00:06:40.06 Andrew we'll mail you some beans great uh gathered and I were thinking maybe

00:06:43.12 maybe Saturday morning we'll get up early Saturday morning and pop the beans

00:06:47.12 in the hole and you know set [ __ ] on fire and stuff and then uh and then by

00:06:51.21 the time we finish it in baseballs 24

00:06:54.04 hours later they'll be cooked I think it's a phenomenal idea um

00:06:59.18 Eric thoughts I'm for it uh I can't think of anything more quenching after

00:07:03.16 350 baseballs than beans that have been sitting in your yard for a day more

00:07:07.14 quenching than coffee and soup though yes yeah I mean it's probably I'll be

00:07:11.08 honest probably going to be pretty close [Laughter]

00:07:15.07 [Music]

00:07:16.09 Have you just swung a baseball bat 350

00:07:19.01 times come get these red hot beans you have to do work to get out of the ground

00:07:24.00 you know that feeling when you're so tired and dehydrated and hot where is

00:07:28.03 that feeling that you get really where water just tastes so amazing and you

00:07:32.01 just love every second of it going down your gullet I cannot imagine that with

00:07:36.17 beans I really don't think we're gonna be able to get this

00:07:41.05 uh there's no que there's no thirst quench quite like a bean quench [Laughter]

00:07:49.01 so just trying to understand the mechanics of this you're gonna so you put the

00:07:54.11 beans in the hole once you make the beans you put them in a pot

00:07:59.00 pot goes in the hole you then have to fill the hole again correct

00:08:03.09 yeah so what you do is you put them in a cast iron like a dutch oven then you

00:08:08.23 triple seal it with uh with like uh saran wrap not straight up but tin foil

00:08:14.00 and uh aluminum foil and then you pour hot coals all over it and then

00:08:19.04 you seal that into the ground and then put a couple feet of dirt on top of it

00:08:22.22 okay so you're gonna have to re-dig the hole after all this as well uh yeah for

00:08:28.06 sure okay and how deep is the hole how deep is the

00:08:32.14 hole uh Gavin how deep is the hole

00:08:35.20 he might be measuring it right now I think he left the measure where did he

00:08:41.01 go I have no idea maybe he's dinkling he's getting his dinklage's stick

00:08:44.22 it's big how many yeah how many what would you guess are you incapable of

00:08:48.15 guessing how deep the hole is uh I have a pretty good idea how deep the hole is

00:08:51.19 I was just trying to work I was trying to work Gavin into it for a reason I'll

00:08:55.01 show you here in a second okay uh I was trying to work Gavin into it because of

00:08:59.10 what's going on in this photo that I'm posting to the discord right now

00:09:03.15 what am I looking at you're looking at a guy with a gas powered leaf blower five

00:09:08.09 feet from me blowing leaves in my backyard that I didn't know my

00:09:11.19 girlfriend's scheduled somehow during the podcast so I was trying not to I was

00:09:17.05 trying not to talk for a second Gavin are you here uh oh

00:09:21.18 is somebody printing the lost are you okay well I've just realized

00:09:26.15 this computer's been on for well a month without being used and it's really

00:09:31.15 it's really struggling to open slack I'm trying to oh [ __ ] you oh

00:09:37.22 the whole video and it's just it sort of loads a new piece and then I

00:09:42.15 can't hear anything for a minute and then it loads a little bit more welcome

00:09:46.12 to my world this is great Andrew to my computer while I've been

00:09:50.17 away Andrew I think you've just done it by being away I can't take credit for

00:09:55.16 that okay I I I'd say the hole's two feet

00:09:58.22 deep what do you think that's it all of that [ __ ] every all of that you dig

00:10:04.04 two feet I'm gonna tell you I'm gonna tell you

00:10:08.13 what I told Gavin in the moment when I was between breaths

00:10:12.21 every scene in every movie where somebody gets murdered or accidentally

00:10:18.04 hit by a car and they have to cover it up by digging a

00:10:21.22 a real grave to put the body in in the woods at night like lit by a car

00:10:28.06 is [ __ ] it is impossible to dig a human-sized hole [ __ ] you every director

00:10:35.09 in the history of film who has put that into a movie you're a [ __ ] liar who's

00:10:40.19 never dug a [ __ ] hole in your [ __ ]

00:10:44.06 life that's what I'll suggest I'll also say this too because they're my entire

00:10:47.22 house sorry Kevin let me cut you off but my entire house is built on rock I

00:10:53.16 guarantee you more murders go solved in Texas because

00:10:58.19 of the ground than any other state

00:11:02.06 well yeah in films I feel like it would be really easy to get an accurate

00:11:06.20 representation because you know the actors stood next to the hole they've

00:11:10.14 just in quotes dug I probably actually stood next to just two people from the

00:11:15.02 art department who actually just dug the hole so just mimic what they're doing

00:11:19.05 and you'd have an accurate representation they have tools what's yours

00:11:24.02 wait can we recap what you had for your two foot hole

00:11:29.05 why don't you watch the video I'd love to watch the video oh my god okay I'm

00:11:34.12 gonna see if this works oh boy it's only about a minute

00:11:38.09 yeah okay we're gonna notify we have okay we're gonna see what happens here

00:11:43.20 we go can everyone everyone see feet uh hold on yeah okay swap over oh I can

00:11:48.06 see feet yeah watch stream okay here it comes this will be on our YouTube page.

00:12:00.07 [Laughter]

00:12:03.05 The well-prepared tool of a hammer.

00:12:10.10 [Laughter]

00:12:32.19 If you put a shoe on that pot it would be above ground

00:12:42.13 that was like a heist movie where like everything like a comedy heist film

00:12:47.22 where literally everything goes wrong that was amazing that was a an hour down

00:12:53.06 to about a minute I was about to say what'd you have about 60 minutes of

00:12:58.02 - footage there oh yeah I had at least 50 - something minutes.

00:13:01.16 Can I can I ask a question yeah why did you try to dig through the rock

00:13:07.09 yeah why not instead of another hole you like around like around it we were

00:13:11.09 having trouble digging around and we didn't know how big it was so then we

00:13:14.21 thought what if we split it in half and then

00:13:18.23 just dig it up in pieces oh what it's still like the worst

00:13:22.00 like you're [ __ ] Andy Dufresne trying to get through a rock like well I don't

00:13:26.08 understand yeah and unfortunately we didn't have any spoons did you not

00:13:31.16 have either of you two idiots they're helping us oh I would have just said

00:13:36.21 let's dig a different hole we're three shoved we're three shovels into this

00:13:41.22 rock here man we didn't it was a while before we realized

00:13:46.08 yeah in in retrospect should we the second we hit that rock

00:13:50.12 have stopped of course we should have gone to a different spot of the yard

00:13:55.06 although I got to be honest with you there were at least three rocks that

00:14:00.15 size in the vicinity of that because we touched them all I have no uh

00:14:04.14 I'm pretty certain that there's a rock every six inches like that in my yard so

00:14:08.04 it wouldn't have mattered we would have just had a bunch of third dug holes yeah

00:14:12.13 the whole place is like natural bean hole prevention yeah

00:14:16.03 I just there was not even an like I understand what you're saying but the

00:14:19.03 fact that there wasn't even an attempt at a whole two is what is wild to me not

00:14:23.02 that you're not right like you could be totally right but I don't understand

00:14:26.18 being married to that hole do you know why we found the second rock when I go

00:14:32.02 there's another rock here the third rock it's because we decided to shift the

00:14:36.06 whole over away from the second rock and as we did that like the whole you don't

00:14:40.12 notice it but it gets bigger at the end because we did essentially what you're

00:14:44.21 saying Andrew we stretched the hole out to the right and

00:14:47.18 hit another [ __ ] rock you just you're just making that hole

00:14:52.04 wider that's not a different hole you're just extending

00:14:55.18 your base hole I'd move to a completely different part of the yard

00:14:58.18 it would be the same result dude I don't know if you know that

00:15:02.20 I'm pretty sure based on the video I just saw I don't think you're an expert

00:15:06.15 in this field in any way there's zero opinion you could just have without

00:15:10.16 trying that I believe based on your expertise well here's what we're gonna

00:15:14.21 have to do uh to so that I can respect your opinion on holes we're gonna need

00:15:19.18 you to turn in a video of you digging a hole showing us how it's done maybe do

00:15:24.19 like a bob vela you know uh like home improvement style video

00:15:28.16 explaining how to properly dig a hole as Canadians do if listen it has to be in

00:15:33.22 your yard first of all because it's every terrain is different so if we're

00:15:38.10 like really comparing if we're trying to make my point

00:15:40.23 accurate it's that you could have dug a much easier better hole with a lot less

00:15:46.02 effort so it have to be in your yard it's

00:15:47.21 challenging in a million ways I think by

00:15:51.12 the time we've done the actual bean hole and eating the beans

00:15:55.22 it it'll be enough for like a full half an hour episode on our YouTube channel

00:16:00.00 experience because there's so much footage I can't wait to put the beans yet I

00:16:05.02 can't wait for another food review where I just watch you guys all eat and talk

00:16:08.14 about how good the food is that's going to be great a follow-up that's our whole

00:16:12.10 that's the gimmick well as we know you will not set foot in the u.s until

00:16:17.04 after June [Laughter]

00:16:19.03 and if you did come to the u.s in June it wouldn't be Vegas that's for sure

00:16:24.12 not till the fall that was that supplemental was great and

00:16:28.13 it's hard to believe that there's 20

00:16:31.14 minutes before I think just like I don't know if

00:16:34.04 sometimes people miss them we we release supplemental content sometimes and it's

00:16:37.13 generally on our feed I think it almost always is but if you haven't listened to

00:16:41.10 it there's a supplemental that is just titled eric's job I believe of just us

00:16:46.21 trying to schedule the block of episodes we had to do as

00:16:50.13 well as something in the future and it's that was 45 minutes long

00:16:55.07 I need you I just need to I I need to share this

00:16:59.03 I saw Geoff yesterday before he dug a hole for beans and then he asked

00:17:03.16 why we scheduled so much in one week like he wasn't in the recording

00:17:11.03 and then we released the thing where we all agreed when it would be scheduled

00:17:17.03 we scheduled two faces a bean hole mvp2 watch along and baseballs all in

00:17:26.06 seven days and we're gonna do all of it but one when it's all said and done we

00:17:32.05 you almost cancelled bean hall but we uh I tried half of it yeah I I was just

00:17:36.16 happy that all of my stuff worked out I got back in time I was

00:17:40.16 available for all of those super in the future calendar invites and

00:17:45.01 uh that it was gonna be Geoff in the end who was gonna cancel it

00:17:48.20 I I did have to cancel the mvp too I apologize for that I will accept all the

00:17:54.02 blame for that one but I am I am devoting my entire weekend to beans and

00:17:57.19 baseballs and uh so I feel like there's redemption in that alone Geoff felt so

00:18:03.01 bad about canceling mvp2 on Friday he texted me personally about it

00:18:07.09 yeah like out of character yes it's uh I'm excited we'll eventually

00:18:12.06 watch it we'll get there we'll do it next week

00:18:14.12 okay I I watched the first one because you said in passing Gavin I feel like

00:18:18.08 you're joking that I need to record like a recap for you guys to get into part

00:18:22.02 two to know where the story's going I wanted you to edit the movie down into

00:18:25.20 like yeah oh there's this one I'm doing with my

00:18:28.15 recording I took notes I watched it with notes I'm ready I'm ready to record a

00:18:34.13 three-minute version of mvp that was not a throwaway comment that is

00:18:39.09 uh that's a necessity what's happening [Applause]

00:22:17.23 childhood we should talk about the donkey Kong 64 bet because we haven't

00:22:21.21 actually talked about the conclusion oh yeah what a show what are all the

00:22:26.06 dangling comedic threads we have to we have to pull and wrap up here we have

00:22:31.09 the that bet for sure anything else out there

00:22:34.10 well I I also want an update on uh andrew's mom's butt plugs okay you have

00:22:38.09 an update on that yeah survey update the the survey is continuing to happen

00:22:42.20 every once in a while we'll be talking and then she'll just be like yeah I ask

00:22:46.00 this person uh and they do I will say it's been a roll

00:22:50.12 of do not know what it is it's been quite the chain I think the last four

00:22:54.14 people haven't heard of butt plugs and are these the last four people are

00:22:58.07 they all uh around your mom's age like in her uh yeah still yeah they're all

00:23:02.04 all around the same age I think there is generational butt plug blindness you

00:23:06.20 think so yeah funny enough that's what butt plugs

00:23:10.06 originally were supposed to cure it was blindness

00:23:13.18 it wrapped around a little medical cure that's the funniest joke you've ever

00:23:20.01 said oh that's good that's good [Laughter]

00:23:23.16 so donkey Kong donkey Kong donkey Kong so donkey Kong was a journey so just to

00:23:29.14 recap what the bet was it's going to be very weird for people because this will

00:23:34.06 just be like nothing's ever changed and we haven't spoken in a month um

00:23:37.18 what was I had 48 hours right to beat all of donkey Kong was it 44 and I could

00:23:42.04 ask for four more hours within the first six or some [ __ ] I feel like I got

00:23:46.23 tricked I'm just going to say that I agree I feel like

00:23:50.01 this let me talk about how big of a [ __ ] [ __ ] Gavin is for a minute

00:23:54.04 just let me pivot to this so I start I start the stream I had I was furious

00:23:58.14 with you and it's not your fault it was bad timing not a real comment

00:24:02.23 I started the stream and I don't know if you remember this Gavin but apparently

00:24:06.07 there is no game play audio when I streamed to you as just Andrew the

00:24:10.13 donkey Kong guy I could have swore there was but I didn't change anything

00:24:14.23 and there was no game audio at the start of the stream so I get ready to go I

00:24:20.17 we've been talking about it I launch at midnight on Saturday

00:24:23.19 I'm going to play nobody can hear anything I've no idea what's wrong I

00:24:28.08 didn't realize this would be an issue everything's broken I'm trying to figure

00:24:32.17 it out it takes me 50 or so minutes to figure out why it's not working I have

00:24:38.09 to download an application for it apparently streaming game audio through

00:24:42.09 obs is a nightmare so I had to install all these plugins so then I eventually I

00:24:47.05 get the game audio going that's working but I've burped my first hour so I don't

00:24:51.06 even start donkey Kong until 1am so then I start playing and we're playing it's

00:24:55.11 going well I'm playing through the game and uh the audio stops working once

00:24:59.23 again and I was like ah this is that's an annoying thing and I'm checking

00:25:03.05 through my settings it's not obs it's specifically with the emulator I'm

00:25:07.22 using and I can't do anything to fix it so I thought oh you know what I'll this

00:25:12.06 is I'd want this to be the best experience possible for the people I'll

00:25:15.23 save my game and I'll reboot my emulator and then we'll go back to it they'll

00:25:20.19 have audio so I do all that and it doesn't remember my save file so I

00:25:25.12 played for one hour first hour 12 to 1 technical

00:25:29.14 difficulties play for an hour one to two

00:25:32.20 the audio breaks I lose my save file I'm back at the beginning in that window of

00:25:37.20 time in which I had reset the game I've been trying to play for two hours at

00:25:42.23 this point I take the stream offline for like three minutes to reboot it and

00:25:46.19 Gavin texts me hey where's my stream you

00:25:49.16 told me you'd be streaming this where is it and I'm like you [ __ ] I'm

00:25:54.17 resetting it for a minute and I'm pretty sure I'm going to lose all my progress

00:25:59.16 go [ __ ] yourself that's where my stream is

00:26:01.17 it's only uh this had happened before and we warned you about this shitty

00:26:06.07 emulator setup yeah and uh and what you just decided it would be

00:26:09.20 fine this time well I think what you told us was this is the easiest solution

00:26:13.12 and I've already done it and I know it works to be fair okay so there was I I

00:26:18.06 think there is a way to save I just don't know how to do it I had changed

00:26:23.01 the emulator I was using control s uh previously and I I think there is a

00:26:27.13 controller that was funny um I just can't I don't know I need to

00:26:31.13 figure that out so anyway that increases the risk for me because if at any point

00:26:35.23 my emulator crashes my computer like the power goes off for a minute if my

00:26:39.23 emulator goes down I lose all of my progress no matter where I'm at I cannot

00:26:45.07 save I need to keep everything going so I played I think from 2am until 8am

00:26:50.06 fell asleep woke up two hours later and didn't sleep

00:26:53.16 again the rest of the way it took me 29

00:26:57.01 hours to beat donkey Kong 64. I think I played like 26 of those 29 hours uh

00:27:03.11 it was a grind 26 hours to be it that was not the quoted time that you said no

00:27:09.05 it was okay so what I realized is the game [ __ ] sucks I already knew

00:27:14.00 that it's a terrible game in the middle of this experience I had

00:27:18.20 the realization that I don't think I've hated anybody's childhood more than

00:27:24.04 gavin's between the tuxedo and donkey Kong 64. Uh your childhood

00:27:28.17 was atrocious as far as I did you can't they're not together like I didn't like

00:27:32.22 the tuxedo but I loved donkey Kong but it's all part of your childhood

00:27:37.20 everything we keep dabbling into your childhood and everything about it stinks

00:27:43.05 it's not fun it's um the game is atrocious so how it works is

00:27:46.12 you need bananas you need golden bananas to open doors and then you need a

00:27:50.14 certain number of level bananas that are different colors for each character to

00:27:53.23 fight the boss of the level so I just once I had enough golden

00:27:57.08 bananas which I was able to do in the first two or three levels

00:28:00.17 I just sped run through the game collecting the bananas to fight the

00:28:04.03 bosses so they're like the last three levels I didn't even really play I was

00:28:07.17 just collecting bananas to get there and it was just painful by the end of it I

00:28:13.09 think 80 of the way through I lost game audio again people are like

00:28:16.22 where's the audio and I was like I'm so sorry I cannot I can't risk this because

00:28:21.05 it is one of the worst games I played in a really long time it is painfully bad

00:28:26.05 it's tedious it's just terrible I cannot afford my soul does not have another

00:28:30.21 reset in me 75 of the way through so it's like

00:28:34.05 trying to land a plane that is duct taped together I was so worried that the

00:28:38.07 like the first sign of the emulator crashing was gonna be that the audio

00:28:41.22 goes out then I got stuck on a boss that requires audio cues so that was fun for

00:28:46.08 like 50 minutes I figured that out eventually is that

00:28:50.00 the canon into the thing the cardboard cut out yeah it's the cardboard cutout

00:28:55.05 boss luckily there's a pattern that is also visual but all of the guides are

00:28:58.22 like yeah just listen for this sound and then I was like you're [ __ ] this is I

00:29:03.09 might be stuck here I might not be able to do this I have no audio uh I get

00:29:07.09 through that it is now 5 a.m Alden ring is a really popular game right now I

00:29:13.01 feel like the creator of those dark souls games was a big donkey Kong 64 fan

00:29:18.00 because the final boss is such [ __ ]

00:29:21.09 it is horrendous it's a cool it's a cool background I I wouldn't know because

00:29:25.16 I've never I never got to that as a kid and I've never beaten the game but I've

00:29:31.08 seen videos and uh it's a five-round fight made up of smaller

00:29:35.11 rounds and if you lose at any point you have to start the entire fight again you

00:29:39.21 basically have to play as donkey Kong diddy Kong tiny Kong and if you lose

00:29:44.06 then you're all the way back to donkey Kong yeah

00:29:47.01 it is a lot of staying alive to get to that point so it's five rounds you have

00:29:51.03 to play as each Kong if you die at any point there's no checkpoint you have to

00:29:56.12 go back to the beginning it probably is like a 10 to 15 minute boss fight in its

00:30:00.12 entirety so doing this at like 5 a.m I'm exhausted I'm so sick of these [ __ ]

00:30:06.02 kongs I'm having to restart over and over it was so bad Gavin texted me like

00:30:09.22 this is this is bad this is terrible um but I got through it I beat it Sunday I

00:30:15.09 think it was like 5 a.m my time and I won the bet undefeated in gaming related

00:30:20.06 bets

00:30:23.11 this is where I was uh watching it from uh that is

00:30:29.01 ah were you on your way to england yep I was watching it from my living room it

00:30:34.08 was pretty cool that was me landing at Heathrow and I just whipped it on dude

00:30:37.22 that's awesome it's the things that break your so as Gavin said the reason

00:30:42.02 in the past he never beat it because you have to replay three levels of the

00:30:45.19 original donkey Kong in a row to get a coin that you need to progress through

00:30:50.06 the story and it sucks it's a difficult game to play he could never finish it

00:30:54.23 and it took me a while it took me I want to say 80 minutes or so

00:30:59.09 to beat this thing and it was very stressful

00:31:01.09 and I'm so excited I was like yeah I [ __ ] did it like finally like this is

00:31:05.09 one of the hurdles to get through one of the toughest parts of this thing they

00:31:08.20 make you do it twice you have to do it twice in a row I forgot about that it

00:31:12.18 was so deflating to do it and get essentially nothing for it and then

00:31:17.09 immediately just be like yeah do it again just do it again for no reason

00:31:20.21 it's pretty sadistic game it [ __ ]

00:31:23.00 sucks how long did it take you to do the final boss uh the final boss took me

00:31:28.15 probably an hour how many times do you think he died in the process uh

00:31:34.04 probably like five or six I'd say it was I think in a different it's the

00:31:38.02 fear of my emulator resetting everything

00:31:40.12 as I got further into the game that part of it became more stressful so it's 5

00:31:44.20 a.m I'm stressed and just trying to get through that was a nightmare we really

00:31:48.13 tried to steer you away from putting yourself in that situation but you were

00:31:51.22 adamant about it you were yeah no it's that was I'm not I'm not blaming anybody

00:31:55.20 for that part of it that's my [ __ I up but it was fun to do overall my only

00:32:01.03 problem with this stream and the previous halo ones that you guys have done

00:32:04.17 is I love to get in and watch them and I watched way more of this one than I

00:32:08.12 commented on because anytime I get in the chat and try to talk to people

00:32:12.13 they just accuse me of not being me and then I have to jump through hoops to try

00:32:15.17 to convince people that I am me and I just give up I'm tired of it I'm just

00:32:19.12 gonna come up with I'm just gonna go in as a different name

00:32:22.17 it's like I can't ever have a conversation without getting yelled at

00:32:27.05 by 30 people to stop pretending to be me I'm the same way I think uh who was it

00:32:31.10 that banned me from their twitch chat.

00:32:36.04 I don't remember what it was it was maybe it was

00:32:40.12 it was like years ago a Reddit post or something where I was posting as me and

00:32:44.03 they didn't believe it was me so I had to take a photo of myself holding like

00:32:49.07 what day it was it was this insane verification pro it felt like a hostage

00:32:54.06 situation it was absurd it was just for some nonsense take that had like zero

00:32:58.08 relevance to anything it's just [ __ ]

00:33:00.12 ugh yeah that was fun so I won the bet you

00:33:03.16 need to wear 64 pieces of clothing on an rt podcast at some point I get to pick

00:33:09.16 one of those pieces of clothing I'm going to be I kind of have an idea

00:33:14.04 right now but I'll talk to Geoff about it I'd love to get his opinion on it so

00:33:19.14 this is actually great because I have been on the rt podcast twice this week

00:33:25.11 uh because this week wasn't busy enough

00:33:27.04 so I said [ __ ] it I'll go on some other people's podcast too uh so I had to do

00:33:31.03 the rt podcast twice this week and both times because it was different casts

00:33:34.18 people have said so Gavin he doesn't come on the rt podcast anymore and I got

00:33:39.18 to go well I know he'll be on at least once more I can guarantee that

00:33:44.21 very accurate well [ __ ] um hmm it's gonna be a sweaty one I believe as

00:33:50.17 soon as I won Gavin immediately texted me I need to buy some ties

00:33:59.09 we'll figure that out though I have an idea I'd like to hear your thoughts

00:34:04.10 though Geoff and uh at some point at some point Gavin will be wearing 64

00:34:10.02 pieces of clothing that's very exciting a socks two or one uh what do you mean

00:34:15.07 like is there pair one or just a two seconds oh

00:34:18.12 no one sock is a sock so if you have a pair of socks there's two socks yeah

00:34:22.07 yeah wow generous everybody just disagrees I think that's fair I think

00:34:26.19 that's like I'd be breaking what a sock is like it's just I'd be changing the

00:34:30.17 definition at that point Eric why do you have such a problem with that because

00:34:35.05 it's a pair of socks because you don't wear

00:34:37.12 yeah but they say they say pair of pants too okay yeah like if I if I put on one

00:34:42.12 glove am I wearing half of clothes right but but you don't typically you could

00:34:46.17 typically wear one glove you can wear one glove doing something typically two

00:34:50.12 socks are worn okay so a pair of socks I think a pair of glasses what if you've

00:34:55.01 only got one leg for for a podcast that's so hung up on

00:34:59.00 regulation I think it's very strange to draw the line where the two socks

00:35:04.04 are individual things instead of one especially after we sold socks and we

00:35:09.17 had to sell them together so I don't understand what the issue like to me it

00:35:14.06 doesn't matter but if you buy it's two socks

00:35:17.16 yeah nick says isn't a pair two things yeah right yes but

00:35:20.23 but again typically when things are regulation worn it's two socks or one item.

00:35:27.12 I mean I I have no dog in this fight I have no

00:35:32.19 problem acquiescing this that's what what do I what do I have to wear all the

00:35:37.13 things that's fine I'm just saying that that's how it feels to me I feel like

00:35:41.00 I'm talking to me like this is the reverse like I'm on the other side for

00:35:44.21 some one of these things you know yeah yeah yeah I understand how to say but I

00:35:48.17 don't know why go ahead Geoff I just eric's eric's

00:35:52.11 argument is persuasive I think I might be on their excitement I don't think I

00:35:56.01 might be on their side now how often are you walking around with one sock that's

00:36:00.08 my thing I don't think the thing is you can't go up to someone and say hey throw

00:36:05.05 me that socks [Laughter]

00:36:09.01 what can you say Gavin what would be the

00:36:12.00 appropriate have you ever asked anything

00:36:14.02 it was socks plural or that sucks I feel like no matter like no matter what word

00:36:18.03 you use that's still a weird sentence to say to you you are

00:36:21.21 you're getting hung up on the thing that you're not wearing I am hung up on the

00:36:26.09 thing that you are wearing where it is two socks are typically counted like

00:36:30.13 they're one item a pair a pair of socks is like what you

00:36:34.21 don't typically wear one sock that's what I'm saying again they can be

00:36:38.12 individual one sock can be one sock I I say go for it I'm just I'm saying that

00:36:43.12 in terms of an outfit it just it's strange to me I think you're completely

00:36:47.11 right but I think by definition if somebody was like

00:36:51.03 if are you agreeing with me and then telling me

00:36:54.21 that no so I'm agreeing with I'm agreeing with the point you're saying

00:36:59.04 but I'm disagreeing with its use in this context I'm agreeing with what you're

00:37:03.09 saying in the sense of like if someone buys

00:37:06.04 a sock is like two socks is sold as an individual item it's one but in the

00:37:10.20 context of if Gavin were to put one sock

00:37:14.06 on we wouldn't we wouldn't consider that a half an item

00:37:17.22 I'll say this Andrew that was spoken like a true internet lawyer yeah yeah

00:37:22.15 yeah are you still certified up on the website oh I'm still getting updates all

00:37:27.16 the time for hire judge I get like two a week that's such a throwback

00:37:32.08 over a year ago plus it's really easy to get in it's deep

00:37:36.17 lore and deeply I think Eric is more like Andrew than he was when we

00:37:42.04 started face I think Andrew is rubbed off on him I definitely think that

00:37:47.18 there's I think that I lean into it in this show because regulation is so

00:37:51.18 important for this for for face jam or any other show who cares for this show

00:37:56.19 regulation is apparently the most important thing in the [ __ ] world so

00:38:01.12 I I'm just trying to figure out what the regulation sock is you know what Eric I

00:38:05.20 I agree with you I think that's correct I think regulation is the most important

00:38:09.14 thing in this show I think regulation is a sock

00:38:13.01 Eric would you be able to arrange me a fan for whenever we do that podcast do

00:38:17.17 you want you want like somebody to come and cheer you on or you want something

00:38:22.01 to blow area probably the air thing okay

00:38:24.19 yeah yeah yeah I'll get you I'll get you one of those little ones like you know

00:38:28.02 like the little fan that you hold like like a drink like uh

00:38:32.17 yeah like a head like takes a triple a battery type fan

00:38:36.09 oh you talk about like a paper fan.

00:38:40.02 I think socks came out I don't think something I think this the clothing has

00:38:45.14 to be surface level like it has to appear

00:38:49.06 like you couldn't wear like 20 pairs of underwear

00:38:52.23 what if you wear them over your pants then that's allowed as long as it's a

00:38:58.04 building up and not down I can't wear 20 underwear well as long

00:39:01.21 as they're in front of the pants I think

00:39:03.16 is the regulation well does the does the initial pair of under the initial pair

00:39:08.02 of underwear accounts like underwear account pants count and

00:39:12.04 then anything over pants counts okay cool cool

00:39:14.10 but you can't go underwear underwear underwear pants Gavin which maybe you

00:39:18.04 normally do and if you do I wouldn't I would understand because if I had the

00:39:22.03 same body issues you do but uh but they won't count in this sense yeah I don't

00:39:25.12 think I've done that since I had food poisoning that one time

00:39:30.13 god I had food poisoning gloves for individual fingers why would they make that

00:39:37.05 unless it's like one of those shitty like oh look at how wacky I am I got

00:39:42.12 finger gloves you know what if you start talking individual finger gloves I'm

00:39:47.09 definitely going over to eric's side not that [ __ ]

00:39:50.01 look it's a bet against Andrew I have to loophole this somehow

00:39:54.20 I've got to do what he would do that's true that's a good point I don't know 64

00:39:59.09 paper crowns from Christmas crackers you couldn't fit 64 crayons on your head

00:40:04.12 um seems like a challenge there's a zero I couldn't fit one on my head it's a

00:40:09.21 nightmare the Christmas cracker crown head is way too big for that [Music]

00:40:15.11 I'm gonna text you the thing that I was thinking of Geoff

00:40:19.01 and I'll just get your immediate live reaction the podcast

00:40:21.22 next time well I guess we're recording too so next week or whenever we record

00:40:25.18 again not net next episode we'll lock it in I'll find something

00:40:30.10 that we could definitively share but this is sort of where my head's at

00:40:35.12 just the the top part of what I just say it's my initial thought

00:40:39.20 oh oh pulling it up right now and I guess you should probably oh yeah

00:40:43.12 oh I'm yes okay excellent excellent excellent excellent I I I'm glad you're

00:40:47.15 going in this direction okay oh man that's not good for me that's I had that

00:40:52.10 thought at some point and yeah this is you're brilliant this is great that's

00:40:56.13 really really great fantastic when do I find out uh

00:41:00.08 10 minutes before the podcast probably next week we'll we'll do it I have if we

00:41:06.06 want to talk about deep lore I have an update I had something happen

00:41:10.21 in my life that that connects all the way back to the first episode of

00:41:15.14 this podcast oh real reach I got my hair cut oh

00:41:18.15 congratulations I haven't got my hair cut since December of 2019 I got my hair

00:41:24.00 cut it was a process this whole time you've had really long hair yeah it's

00:41:29.06 gotten progressively longer with this show I haven't had a single haircut

00:41:33.16 because I was way serious yeah are there photos no no photos

00:41:38.10 god what that means that means I haven't seen you since we started face oh wait

00:41:43.11 before that yeah I know but I know in real life but

00:41:47.09 I I haven't even seen you like on video or on a picture

00:41:50.00 the entire time we've had this oh no it's my hair was like between my

00:41:54.15 shoulder blades it was long I've been picturing you all wrong this whole time

00:41:58.09 it's my my hair got you the final straw was I was having issues where I'd go to

00:42:02.21 like bring my neck up like I'd get to lift my head and I wouldn't realize my

00:42:06.16 hair was trapped behind my back and I'd whip my head back into the pillow I was

00:42:11.09 giving myself whiplash just like I'm [ __ ] I hate everything about this I'm

00:42:16.21 done but as as we start stated in the first episode my guy was in

00:42:20.00 a retirement home which has been very difficult to get into

00:42:24.13 during the pandemic it's been a very restrictive part but unfortunately for me

00:42:28.23 uh he retired so I had to get a new guy did he go out to a farm out west with

00:42:33.12 lots of space to run around in he did I think he actually just moved upstairs

00:42:38.02 I think since he was already there he just took a took a place on

00:42:41.18 the building but I got I got my hair cut and I went completely the other way I

00:42:46.01 went from a retirement home to a place that has like graffiti yard on the walls

00:42:49.20 and skateboards and it's the vibe is couldn't be further from the other thing

00:42:54.00 it was great I think the vibe of the retirement home

00:42:56.17 is closer to your personal vibe you think so

00:43:01.05 all the people magazines and royalty [ __ ] on the thing people cooking

00:43:07.03 noodles and their [Laughter]

00:43:10.20 kettles but uh so I had that happen and it feels great

00:43:15.09 to have short hair again I hated it blowing my mind I really can't believe

00:43:19.12 that every time I've been listening to you on my face you've had long hair oh

00:43:23.05 it's been so long blew my mind not only is he had long hair I bet he's had

00:43:26.23 luscious locks I bet he's like swung it out of his eyes suggestively a few times

00:43:31.04 when he laughed in the podcast we had no it's really curly

00:43:34.12 uh it was sort of curly yeah it was just it was very long and annoying I hated

00:43:38.22 looking down made looking down an annoyance it was terrible uh yeah I

00:43:42.23 hated it too I did it as well for a bit yeah I didn't wait an extra year though

00:43:46.17 like you did it's just it's not good so I have a new

00:43:50.04 guy I bet you look like Glenn danzig with long hair I don't know why oh yeah

00:43:56.10 anyway how's your new guy you guys great but on the way

00:44:01.03 on the I was like walking around because I got there too early so I was like I'm

00:44:04.21 just gonna kill some time so looking at the different stores and I walked past

00:44:09.03 this sign for this bagel place called my hubby's bagels I had like a cute little

00:44:13.10 logo and I was like oh a nice like a local a new bagel place going in this

00:44:18.08 could be great I thought it seemed really cute I was excited about the

00:44:21.23 bagel place uh Geoff just supposed to that actually isn't all that far off

00:44:26.05 you're actually pretty this is pretty accurate you're right it did look very

00:44:31.09 much like that um that's quite the forehead it is

00:44:36.00 that's a fantastic forehead but um I was walking around I found that in my

00:44:41.07 hubby's bagel place and it seemed really cute and so when I came home

00:44:45.05 I was looking at on twitter or whatever and I was like oh that's cool

00:44:48.19 uh I would like updates on this place because I like to get bagels from them

00:44:51.22 whenever they open it seems like a sweet local place so I followed them

00:44:56.04 I didn't think much of it I was telling uh I told like some of my my friends

00:45:00.12 about I was like I encountered this cute bagel place and then like three or four

00:45:04.17 days pass and somebody somebody said to me oh so

00:45:07.23 you followed the bagel place on twitter and I was like what that's a weird

00:45:13.16 yeah yeah I did but like why why are you bringing this up three days later

00:45:19.09 um what ended up happening was uh I accidentally followed the bagel place on

00:45:24.00 the facepod twitter account.

00:45:26.10 I didn't know I didn't know I signed in as that

00:45:29.01 because twitter is great you can have multiple accounts you need to swap

00:45:32.12 between the two I was signed in on the Facebook twitter

00:45:36.13 account and somebody commented to your account why do you follow six people and

00:45:43.07 one of them is my hobbies bagels so if you look

00:45:47.12 if you look at our twitter account it's like it's myself Eric Geoff Gavin

00:45:54.08 like the rooster t store maybe it's like one other it's a company thing and then

00:46:00.18 just my hubby's bagels they have 23 followers and one of them

00:46:05.21 is Facebook well you gotta leave that on there or oh I can't take it off I can't

00:46:11.05 take it off the reply was to the person you like what [Laughter]

00:46:18.02 that's amazing do they sell t-shirts I don't they're not even open yet they're

00:46:23.18 just they don't like I don't think that ever works like putting your twitter

00:46:28.02 handle on your store like who I was I'm thinking like who actually ever goes and

00:46:31.22 follows those but you do you're one of those people

00:46:34.20 well it's just I would like to know when they open so it just seemed convenient

00:46:38.12 like I don't know I'm not like gonna be in that area all that often so I was

00:46:41.21 like this will be this would be great I'll be able to check this out whenever

00:46:45.09 you were hoping for a future of uh haircuts and bagels is like a package

00:46:49.02 yeah like a one two like a one two get some bagels going get my hair cut but

00:46:54.01 it's just it was so funny I was so I felt so dumb that I followed and I can't

00:46:59.01 wait for their perspective they haven't followed back to my knowledge um

00:47:04.03 but we can hope that's such an exclusive slot no idea

00:47:08.08 dude I just posted their website bagels look good they're gonna be more info

00:47:13.10 posted soon yeah they look great it just seemed like a

00:47:17.17 cute like gay couple what their biggest shop it's great what if we're a bagel

00:47:23.15 podcast now I'm absolutely a bagel guy so it would make sense I feel like this

00:47:27.19 is what we should do when as soon as we come to see you Andrew maybe that's

00:47:31.10 where we'll have our first breakfast how are we going to miami's bagels yeah

00:47:35.19 that's a great idea before we go crabbing we'll go we'll eat bagels I

00:47:39.01 wanted everything bagel I think those are raisins Eric that is just too many

00:47:43.06 raisins like why would you have so many raisins with a with a baked good

00:47:47.12 that's a lot of there's a raisin bagel there I think it's a raisin bagel I

00:47:51.00 think it's like a style it's supposed to be like a look at these raisins like

00:47:56.10 these are the ingredients not like yeah 150 raisins no it's not like fresh

00:48:00.14 ingredients right I assume so I think they're trying to be like this is the

00:48:04.21 five these are the fresh raisins because

00:48:07.22 they also they also put the cream cheese [ __ ] first off [ __ ] cream cheese

00:48:11.16 right they put the cream cheese in a glass container like who the [ __ ] does

00:48:14.20 that also [ __ ] glass but that's a whole conversation for later [ __ ] glasses

00:48:25.03 yeah nobody's gonna eat that much cinnamon unless they're doing a tick

00:48:28.04 tock challenge so you have a problem with glass next episode [ __ ] glass

00:48:33.07 I don't want to talk about this we got too much other stuff talking about

00:48:38.02 [ __ ] glass I'm just sick of it

00:48:41.14 how was this how was Europe Gavin how was that oh it was good good

00:48:46.18 times source of a source of family I when I got back I actually went to um

00:48:51.16 I went to tumble 22 nice little chicken place uh

00:48:55.13 Nashville hot chicken if you're wondering it's delicious

00:49:00.00 yeah and the waitress there was uh she mentioned that she was listening to

00:49:04.19 face and I realized it my favorite thing in the world is when someone who is

00:49:09.01 currently working has to say that they like a podcast called face it just

00:49:13.06 sounds so funny in like in a professional environment like oh can I

00:49:16.04 get these out of your way do you want this thing it's like by the way really

00:49:20.04 love face let people around listening it's so good

00:49:23.20 and it wasn't like a just a generic like oh it's a good podcast it was she was

00:49:29.01 literally like right up to date she was complaining about how terrible your list

00:49:33.05 was Andrew of twenty thousand things and I was like that's like damn that's like

00:49:38.04 the most recent one to come out she's really up to date she told Gavin he

00:49:42.06 salad creamed the list

00:49:45.20 yeah and then we were talking Geoff and I were talking about how it's so fun that

00:49:50.04 we have like our own little language almost amongst the

00:49:53.04 the listeners yeah like the like the the I would love to see like a face

00:49:58.19 dictionary with all the face verbs like face it's salad cream uh

00:50:04.19 I wonder I wonder what bagel will be a verb for some day post the photos in the

00:50:10.06 chat of they have 23 followers and us and the second one is what who Facebook.

00:50:18.21 [Laughter]

00:50:23.09 Oh we've got to go there we've got to go to the list of the

00:50:28.19 list of things we've got to do not to go there oh my god

00:50:34.00 we have to spend more than a week there.

00:50:38.12 I feel like Andrew you're secretly dreading us eventually showing up

00:50:43.18 um in your hometown I think you're gonna hate it do you like why do you think

00:50:48.09 that do you think I think that or do you

00:50:50.04 think I will end up hating it no I don't think I don't think you should hey I

00:50:53.10 just think you're you're dreading that moment I get the same when we're

00:50:57.06 actually nearby really no it's not it's the opposite because I feel I'm gonna

00:51:01.03 get validated first of all about my door situation that'll be the first thing

00:51:05.19 I feel it's gonna be a very validating trip for me because I think you're going

00:51:09.16 to be on board with that then you're going to actually go into my place and

00:51:12.23 realize the [ __ ] hall of mirrors that I live in and how absurd

00:51:16.03 that I'm just explaining it correctly but none of this

00:51:19.07 I feel like it's going to be a real eye-opening trip for the two of you and

00:51:23.14 we could go get bagels I think it's gonna be a great time

00:51:27.14 I'm so excited for when it eventually happens it's uh

00:51:30.20 yeah I think we're gonna I appreciate Geoff thinking we need a week I don't

00:51:33.23 know what we're gonna do we're going crabbing do you have any

00:51:37.07 do you have well we might do a bathtub race depending on what time of year we

00:51:40.22 go up there although I refuse to step foot in Canada in June that's not going

00:51:45.05 to happen

00:51:47.22 uh are there any museums in on your island yeah you go to yeah there's a

00:51:53.12 museum there is a museum there's a few museums check out the museum maybe go to

00:51:59.01 learn about the nanaimo bar we uh we can do uh we can play tennis

00:52:03.00 you don't know the nanaimo bar Gavin what's the nanaimo bar it's like the

00:52:07.07 only thing that the place I live live in is known for it's a dessert it was it's

00:52:11.16 called the nanaimo bar it's it's a it's a pastry type it's uh you don't bake it

00:52:16.14 I don't think it's what makes it unique it's like chocolate pastry it's well

00:52:20.21 it's like a chocolate brownie type thing it's like chocolate with a layer of

00:52:26.00 icing and then I'm into it I'll get three of

00:52:29.03 them yeah one of those there's coconut the traditional recipe is is walnuts in

00:52:33.10 the bottom but people also use coconut as a replacement oh I feel like I've had

00:52:38.02 that before yeah I'm sure you have it's it's the denial bar it's all we have we

00:52:43.20 have that in bathtub racing and Andrew panton

00:52:46.14 and a Vancouver child kicker that's the name well

00:52:49.19 that's alleged you know we don't know who that is we don't know where that

00:52:53.12 belongs Vancouver technically not even to nima it's a different place

00:52:58.02 can't take credit on that oh that's like anything else they're

00:53:02.07 okay I don't I don't love them um is there anything else we can do what

00:53:07.14 does nanaimo have to offer can we play tennis we can uh yeah we have that

00:53:12.06 we have a curling rink you probably don't have one of those oh we'll go

00:53:15.12 curling I mean isn't that just an ice rink though is that like a separate

00:53:19.04 specific rink it's just yeah it's a different rink you

00:53:23.05 can't you can't just ice skate on the curling rink so we have to do teams then

00:53:29.11 yeah I guess so who's on whose team not it

00:53:32.10 I assume Eric and nick are also coming not yahoo

00:53:43.18 is that you you don't want to be on my team.

00:53:50.13 I need to review the video before I make

00:53:53.16 any draft picks I need to see the shovel work done by both of you to determine

00:53:56.22 who I think would be the best on the field do you think shoveling skills

00:54:00.06 translate to curling I think because the

00:54:02.23 broom you got the person on the broom in the front

00:54:06.08 you don't stop the ice with the broom no but mechanically they're very similar

00:54:11.12 motions I'll say this of gavin's shoveling skills Andrew if it helps that

00:54:15.06 video uh we had about an hour's worth of

00:54:17.18 footage raw footage Gavin put all of his shoveling stuff in the video you

00:54:23.03 [ __ ] I saw shovel for one second longer than what you watched you watched

00:54:28.23 the entirety of his effort all right let's just see how the uh the

00:54:32.09 main cut of this video turns out.

00:54:36.04 I got all the footage.

00:54:41.16 I would say yeah it was mainly me filming no I'm just kidding you filled

00:54:46.17 up probably probably put in like 2025 of the

00:54:49.16 digging you did too certainly broke the hammer that was good yeah

00:54:53.22 I thought that hammer thing was such a good idea it was a great video

00:55:02.17 can you send me that later Gavin that video I just I just need to have it in

00:55:06.20 my life.

00:55:10.00 I need to be able to go back and watch it

00:55:13.12 are you going to be watching that event tonight yeah I will I'll be laying down

00:55:19.16 you sent me a video once of um your trash cans getting hit over and over

00:55:23.03 again by different things

00:55:26.04 it's like a it's like a three it was like a three act story of like

00:55:30.17 your trash can got stolen and then you got a new one and then the garbage truck

00:55:36.03 took it and then you got a new one and then somebody hit it with a car and that

00:55:40.23 is the video yeah yeah yeah it was uh well that was that's what doesn't really

00:55:46.00 come across in the video is that when and it's recycling so it's every two

00:55:49.07 weeks when your recycling gets eaten they don't bring another one until like

00:55:54.10 the next cycle so I'm missing a recycling if I wait two weeks for one to come I

00:55:59.14 have it for a week it gets swallowed again by the truck I request another one

00:56:03.21 you know we're talking like six weeks in at this point I'm on my third bin the

00:56:08.10 neighbor steals it I request another one and then uh

00:56:12.21 finally a car drives into it because um my alcoholic neighbors went for a drive.

00:56:19.02 [Laughter]

00:56:21.01 I'm a lot faster at bringing them in now you live the real story of these people

00:56:26.17 hate cans but it's just everybody specifically yours it's just your can
