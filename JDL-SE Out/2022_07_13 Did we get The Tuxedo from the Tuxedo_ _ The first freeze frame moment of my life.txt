00:00:15.11 Hello and welcome to another episode of the F**kFuckFacePodcast uh my name is Geoff

00:00:20.15 Ramsey with me as always Andrew panton and Gavin free uh neither of whom are

00:00:26.19 American just thought I'd throw that out there

00:00:30.04 this is episode 100 it's what episode 10011

00:00:33.12 of season four year three volume one I have a question uh yeah

00:00:40.23 um well I I sort of go to discord maybe 10 minutes ago and there was no one in

00:00:46.08 here so I'm wondering did we have some extremely short pleasantries again dude

00:00:52.00 let me tell you about the pleasantries go ahead I logged in I logged in I saw

00:00:57.06 Andrew and nick were already in so I hopped in at 257 to have pleasantries

00:01:01.07 and I hopped in and the first thing I heard Andrew say is and that's the end

00:01:05.18 of that conversation we'll pick this up at a later date oh

00:01:09.08 this is um this is a weird one this is not on our normal day this is almost an

00:01:15.03 emergency face meeting dude not only is it yeah and I I was telling

00:01:20.13 Andrew before uh I have so [ __ ] much to talk about Gavin you know about a lot

00:01:24.09 of it uh there's one thing that happened to me this morning that you don't know

00:01:27.15 about though uh I have so much to [ __ ] talk about but all I care about

00:01:31.16 is a tuxedo so I'm just gonna list my notes and then if we get to them we get

00:01:34.21 to them but at least they're on the page

00:01:35.16 or at least they're on the recording and so I'll remember to get back to them

00:01:39.22 someday so I'm gonna say uh here's my note real fast boot stamp uh fart movie

00:01:45.08 new laptop hi Disney by Disney high seas

00:01:48.15 high five Gavin doorbell dream oh that's another one you don't know about Gavin.

00:01:52.21 [Laughter]

00:01:54.06 Wrecked car gets wrecked and prepare to yell at Andrew about

00:01:58.15 tuxedo so Andrew uh let's get into the tuxedo go right to the well before we

00:02:04.02 get the tuxedo I just want Gavin to know

00:02:06.23 it was a shorter pleasantry period and I was very stressed about that I was

00:02:09.22 getting ready hop in for some quality quality pleasantries at like 1247 my

00:02:14.22 time I was like you know what gotta use the bathroom so I went to use the

00:02:18.17 bathroom it was a larger bathroom trip than I anticipated thought it was

00:02:23.02 yeah it was a real problem I sit on the toilet look at the clock like I'm

00:02:26.08 running out of pleasantry time I want to talk to nick about some things before

00:02:29.19 Geoff gets here and he typically gets here five minutes before so were you

00:02:33.03 opposed to joining the discord from the toilet just to have pleasantries with

00:02:36.06 nick through your phone uh not opposed to it but I guess it didn't

00:02:39.19 it didn't occur to me I was thinking about all the things that I need to

00:02:44.02 discuss because a lot has happened since

00:02:45.19 we first the tuxedo why why did we bleep

00:02:48.09 that in the most recent episode that was the thing that was bleeped a million

00:02:51.08 times I don't understand why we did that why did we do that you're an idiot

00:02:56.19 you're such a stupid bastard what do you mean I don't understand how

00:03:00.07 this is because that came out before the freaking auction and that's the exact

00:03:04.13 conversation I was trying to have with you where you were like oh with this we

00:03:08.08 don't have clearance to land I was like that episode hasn't come out yet we

00:03:11.22 still have time to bleep it what's amazing to me is that when I proofed it

00:03:16.04 there weren't any bleeps so I don't know when it got bleep there was a missing

00:03:19.20 bleep and a tuxedo came out yeah but it didn't

00:03:23.07 come out hard it only came out to the people who were paying extra attention

00:03:27.20 it was like an extra well I mean it so the tuxedo itself ended up being the one

00:03:33.02 of the last items in that block of auction period so it was on Thursday the

00:03:37.12 auction started on Tuesday the tuxedo aspect of it happened on a Thursday but

00:03:42.06 it takes like several days to make your account for it so that's why I didn't

00:03:45.09 get why it was bleeped because even it was before unless somebody already had

00:03:49.18 an account it just felt like a niche thing so I didn't know why that happened

00:03:53.19 but I guess so you were saying it shouldn't have been bleeped because it

00:03:57.00 takes so long to get an account yeah like even though

00:04:00.07 possibly the auction could have happened if our lot was on Tuesday I didn't

00:04:03.11 realize how it worked at the time but also it takes several days to like get a

00:04:07.05 pr you have to get you have to send in a lot of stuff it's a whole process it

00:04:10.16 takes you several days who knows if it takes a an average person several days

00:04:14.11 no it takes everybody and you have to supply some more info he said only on

00:04:19.05 first for a few hours unfortunately Eric made the call on the day we turned in

00:04:24.04 the final version so it was a mad dash to edit so Eric said day off

00:04:28.17 it needs to be bleeped is that what you say I guess so

00:04:31.12 based on what nick said well I will say people seemed to really like the bleeps

00:04:35.17 day before they liked completely yeah they thought it was they thought it was

00:04:40.08 they thought it was like so so bleepy it was comical

00:04:42.23 because we were talking about it the reason it was bleeped the week before

00:04:46.15 was because we didn't know whether we're

00:04:49.05 going to talk about it what we discussed in that one is that it that is now fine

00:04:52.11 to talk about and then after that we realize andrew's done the maths wrong no

00:04:56.15 my math was correct that's what I'm arguing I don't know why this was wrong

00:05:00.11 well I you know you're yelled at me it's

00:05:02.09 very possible I did but I don't think we needed the bleeps I think

00:05:05.13 it doesn't matter get away from the bleeps I just don't they work by the way

00:05:08.20 by the way just just for the audience that is desperately trying to understand

00:05:12.15 what the [ __ ] is going on uh this is the

00:05:14.19 Jackie chan tuxedo from the movie tuxedo

00:05:16.20 that we were gonna buy at auction we got rooster teeth to agree to let us spend

00:05:20.18 up to three thousand dollars to buy the tuxedo which they expected to go for two

00:05:25.20 thousand dollars and then we put it in andrew's incredibly capable hands and I

00:05:31.14 knew in the moment we agreed to do that it was a mistake so

00:05:35.02 when I was I I feel like I was the one that was pushing for this idea the

00:05:38.08 hardest and I thought it would be so funny for us all to watch the auction

00:05:42.12 together and we could bid on it and go through the highs and the lows of trying

00:05:46.18 to secure it that was my vision for it literally every other person involved

00:05:52.11 with the show was out they were away so it was just me by myself

00:05:56.05 and that was terrifying because I got given the Eric card which by myself is a

00:06:01.20 lot of responsibility it was very terrifying to add that to my account I

00:06:05.05 had an all-time dumb moment where Eric sent me the card as two images like the

00:06:09.16 front of the card to the back of the card and he sent me the photo of the

00:06:13.14 front and I was putting that in and I instinctually grabbed my phone and

00:06:17.15 looked at the back of it to put in the bottom the the back of the card like I

00:06:21.09 didn't swap photos I'm so used to like looking at a card and then just twisting

00:06:24.22 it over for the the verification number I physically looked at the back of my

00:06:28.16 phone so that's a great start then I went into the auction because this is

00:06:33.10 Tuesday and our lot is until Thursday and I thought I've never like

00:06:37.07 experienced this before it could be fun to just kind of get a

00:06:40.09 feel for it and see what what like maybe I can learn a strategy from this and so

00:06:45.22 I'm not really paying attention and the item up is like some outfit from star

00:06:50.23 trek like one of the star trek shows and it's expected to go

00:06:54.02 between like six hundred dollars to like a thousand or something like that and I

00:06:59.07 looked and it was currently at twenty thousand dollars was the the bid active

00:07:03.14 and I wasn't really paying attention then I thought I bumped my keyboard and

00:07:07.23 I was convinced that I placed a 25000

00:07:10.12 bid on a piece of star trek memorabilia so that was terrifying I thought I died

00:07:15.01 I had to quadruple check make sure I was all good that was fine avoid that

00:07:19.02 so then I was scared to even open the auction until tuxedo time go ahead uh my

00:07:24.00 headphones went off for about two straight but it's there what do I miss.

00:07:28.21 [Laughter]

00:07:29.23 Andrew Mayer may not have accidentally bid twenty two thousand dollars on a

00:07:33.22 star trek outfit oh okay so we're not at the tuxedo yet no no no no okay sorry

00:07:38.11 all right before we get to the tuxedo I just wanna how would you guys feel I'm

00:07:42.23 just hypothetically throwing this out there how do you feel

00:07:47.20 instead of if we got the tuxedo we had like a variety of maybe smaller

00:07:51.20 items that were kind of show related but fit I was just I wanted to read on that

00:07:55.22 because I was told I could spend to the cap so if we had

00:08:00.07 extra money after the tuxedo or if we just missed entirely I could still try

00:08:06.02 to acquire things well no I wouldn't I wouldn't say there was

00:08:10.09 any any hint of uh of approval for that no I asked for one I got approval I

00:08:14.17 didn't I asked I talked I would say it's not worth spending the money on smaller

00:08:19.05 things that we're not as passionate about unless

00:08:21.21 there's something that really fits like the only thing I was interested in

00:08:25.21 was the tuxedo so I guess it would yeah it would depend on what the other stuff

00:08:29.12 is so there's a variety I put some of them in the chat they made uh for the

00:08:33.16 fast and furious movie a dom treadle license to Shrek on it for some reason I

00:08:38.10 thought that was great they were actually auctioned off the uh bowling

00:08:42.21 hat pins and balls from the bowling scene and the flintstones movie it's

00:08:47.12 like that show specific um the thing I was most excited about is

00:08:50.21 right after the tuxedo was the baseball outfit from the twilight movie in the

00:08:55.04 baseball scene which is a great one of the greatest scenes in that whole series

00:08:58.13 we're kind of a baseball show so I thought we had room we're not really a

00:09:02.13 twilight show no but I mean we're kind of a baseball

00:09:06.12 show and it's like baseball podcast yeah and that's baseball

00:09:11.12 equipment I'd say uniform and all that um so

00:09:14.15 it got to auction day I made I made a strategic decision on this

00:09:19.05 are you laughing at Geoff I'm [ __ ]

00:09:22.03 hate you why do you hate me I'm just telling you what happened I'm excited

00:09:26.12 [ __ ]

00:09:27.18 If this doesn't end us getting that [ __ ] tuxedo and we end up with the

00:09:30.20 goddamn twilight merchandise thousands of dollars on something else haven't you

00:09:34.16 that's what you've done no I'm not saying any I'm just trying to get to

00:09:38.19 where we're at I made a realization I did my research

00:09:42.04 because I was the only one that showed up and it was my responsibility I was

00:09:46.01 told strictly cannot go over 3k that's the max not a penny over doesn't mean go

00:09:51.20 to 3k nah it's not what I did you're just

00:09:54.12 making assumptions of what happened so I made the choice because Gavin before

00:09:58.21 you tell us are we gonna do you predict we're gonna be pleased with what you've

00:10:02.20 done or not I no no spoilers for that but let me ask

00:10:06.14 you let me ask you a question let me ask you a question go ahead

00:10:10.10 am I going to have to am I going to have to use my founder card to smooth stuff

00:10:14.10 over after this I don't think so for a split second I thought that was a

00:10:18.16 special credit card that you have well I do have I am a member of the

00:10:22.23 founders club which does give you a card which gives you discounts on hotels but

00:10:27.02 this is more like uh founded the company and I can get us out of a gym if I need

00:10:31.14 to right I really hate doing that though no no I would if I would have spent 30

00:10:35.20 000 on star trek merchandise though I would expect you to use the founder card

00:10:39.01 to literally murder me that would be fine I'd approve that that that decision

00:10:44.00 but so what I learned in the auction is that

00:10:47.09 there's a minimum bid and then there's their projected windows for bids and I

00:10:51.04 think Gavin you've said that you've used the site before so maybe you know about

00:10:56.00 this I don't know but essentially the minimum bid is below

00:10:59.00 what their lowest expected amount is but unless the bid hits the lowest expected

00:11:05.07 amount they will not sell you the item they will just not offer it to you so I

00:11:10.17 think the amount lowest exactly so I think the lowest bid you could place on

00:11:16.21 the tuxedo was one thousand dollars but their lowest entry point to buy it was 2

00:11:22.10 000. Now there's also fees there's like 30

00:11:24.12 in like additional charges based on how much your bid is and then there's taxes

00:11:29.03 and there's shipping so I did the math and I determined that essentially the

00:11:33.12 most we could spend is 2000 which is the floor for getting the tuxedo I would

00:11:38.21 have paid the extra if you would have texted me

00:11:42.17 last time I warned you that we would need more than that yeah and that we all

00:11:47.11 agreed Gavin and I both agreed we said we'd put money in well you weren't there

00:11:51.09 first of all and second of all I'm always a text away I'm always told

00:11:56.08 specifically not to cross 3000 your issues with Eric it is not with me as

00:12:01.11 told to not cross 3000. So I put 2000

00:12:03.12 in and then I asked nick if he wanted to do

00:12:06.13 the auction with me and even he was busy it's something going on at that exact

00:12:11.05 time so I recorded and nick captured the video of it we have

00:12:16.02 the 17 minutes going into the tuxedo and the tuxedo itself and we had

00:12:20.05 the minimal bid that we could possibly have to get it if anyone if a single

00:12:24.10 person would bid a cent over us I could not counter that based on what my

00:12:29.04 instructions were and we got to the tuxedo dude you've

00:12:32.09 done some interpolation with those instructions nobody said anything about

00:12:36.10 shipping costs and taxes stuff we just told you to spend three thousand dollars

00:12:39.11 on the damn tuxedo you were not part of this we would have worked for the rest

00:12:42.19 now Geoff dictionary kid shut up for a minute I'm talking about

00:12:47.21 dictionaries I had with somebody else that wasn't you these I

00:12:52.14 been very responsible here I have been so responsible you're just

00:12:57.05 yelling at me for no reason so I put the bid in

00:13:00.12 and I watched in fear by myself because nobody else is around and terror

00:13:04.05 and I'm delighted to say that we own the [ __ ] tuxedo I finalized it today

00:13:10.04 not a single person bit on it oh my god we have it that is the best news ever

00:13:19.14 dude congratulations Andrew you've taken something you took it on your own and

00:13:25.14 you nailed it that never happens Andrew I gotta say I believed in you from the

00:13:31.03 start I knew you were gonna pull this off I was just telling Eric the other

00:13:34.11 day we were in California together I was like trust in Andrew you always got a

00:13:38.17 trusted Andrew he'll never steer you wrong 100 of the time oh my god that's

00:13:42.21 amazing so it was terrifying and as I said I don't know if we're going to

00:13:46.11 release it or what it will look like but there's 17 minutes of me reacting to

00:13:52.04 items in the auction and then watching it happen live and he wanted the

00:13:56.05 auctioneer wanted so badly for any other action from anyone he was desperate he

00:14:01.11 was like this is I would just wear this out this is a great tuxedo this is

00:14:06.00 fantastic going once this is a great tux everyone look at how great this Jackie

00:14:11.16 chan wore this going fair warning that I loved tuxedos I looked at it it's

00:14:16.13 cheaper well it's not cheaper it's like seven hundred dollars more than buying

00:14:20.23 an Armani tux from from like new correct oh yeah it's not that much of a

00:14:25.07 difference we got a savings we got the full outfit we got a shirt that has

00:14:28.23 harness holes in the back of it we're missing a few buttons but we can make it

00:14:32.18 work can you imagine buying that tuxedo just in a store and then they offer you

00:14:38.15 a 700 upgrade to Jackie chan's one you would do it right not that much more.

00:14:44.00 [Laughter]

00:14:45.11 I love the idea that offering that as an option of like okay so you can get this

00:14:50.00 one or Jackie chan has worn this seven hundred dollars more what do you think

00:14:54.21 Jackie chan Jackie chan did kung fu in that tuxedo

00:14:58.10 and we're gonna we own it now yeah and we own the one from it's not

00:15:03.01 even a situation where it sounds like there were multiples like this was the

00:15:08.04 one this is what they used this is the [ __ ] thing

00:15:11.20 so that was exciting and terrifying I was just sweating yelling like [ __ ]

00:15:15.17 hit the g hit the gavel hit it because it's like stunned white with stall why

00:15:20.02 are you stalling why like he got a really stretching it out dude yeah it

00:15:23.18 was terrible uh it was very exciting I uh I had had it in my head that we

00:15:28.17 were gonna end up with like a catcher's mitt from twilight and Dominique

00:15:33.19 coretto's Shrek driver's license and I just wanted in my head I'd already

00:15:37.13 worked through it we were just gonna put

00:15:38.08 it on display just like we were gonna do

00:15:40.18 with the tuxedo but it was just gonna be like in a glass case all bundled

00:15:45.12 together that just said not the tuxedo [Laughter]

00:15:49.08 I genuinely was excited about the twilight baseball thing after it but it

00:15:54.12 went for four thousand dollars so it went way over

00:15:57.20 it was huge like people it's an iconic scene from that movie um

00:16:01.12 yeah I also had the thought of like okay

00:16:03.05 now I have it I'm the only one here that that knows that

00:16:06.12 how much do I want to [ __ ] with you two about the fact we missed it or not a

00:16:09.16 tremendous amount I would imagine what could I do a little bit but I didn't

00:16:13.04 want it to be like so exhausting that you weren't even excited that we got it

00:16:17.22 like I felt like there was a fine line of like

00:16:19.23 reverse salad creaming of where I did the right thing but I still [ __ ] it up

00:16:24.04 I didn't think you had it at all because Geoff and I had to trick the universe

00:16:27.08 yesterday into uh hanging out at the last second and we were both pretty

00:16:31.05 convinced that we didn't have it yeah yeah yeah that's true oh man but we

00:16:36.04 did we did knock off a bucket list thing yesterday and we filmed it

00:16:40.23 oh yeah should I post it in the discord uh yeah yeah might as well um but let me

00:16:45.12 just say oh you make a pizza all kidding aside Andrew um I know a second ago I

00:16:50.09 did that I did the funny thing where I was like I talked about how I always

00:16:53.07 believed in you and I never doubted you for a second uh all kidding aside I

00:16:56.22 didn't for one second think you would pull this off I was convinced you would

00:17:01.18 screw it up and you didn't and I want you to know you have got the biggest get

00:17:07.05 out of salad creaming free card from me uh you can cash in whenever you want

00:17:13.11 the final 10 hours you've got that you've got to like get

00:17:16.08 out of Greg free card where like next time whatever it is I don't care I'll

00:17:20.03 just why I will turn the other cheek between the fees and the shipping and

00:17:24.16 everything it costs like two thousand seven hundred dollars for the tuxedo

00:17:28.07 that is so we even went under the cap so we're great that is a bargain but I'd

00:17:33.07 love to see what bucket list I'm assuming it's the pizza would be my

00:17:38.12 guess no no oh okay well first off let me just say this uh

00:17:42.12 I mentioned kind of hilariously that Gavin and I tried to go to Vegas

00:17:46.17 together for a vacation and I was gonna go to the nba finals and uh

00:17:51.12 Emily got covered and so that like two days before the trip we had to cancel

00:17:56.12 right well in the back of our heads it was okay because

00:18:00.02 two weeks later I had this trip to vidcon in anaheim that I had to go do a

00:18:04.12 panel at which if you don't know what vidcon is

00:18:07.08 you're lucky don't look it up you don't need to know it's not a fun time

00:18:11.09 uh I I although I did get to experience Eric bader experience uh vidcon for the

00:18:15.08 first time I wish he was here to talk about it he was it was it was really

00:18:19.07 funny watching his unfiltered opinions of everything that was going on uh

00:18:22.21 anyway so uh because of that I uh I said hey Emily let's go back you know

00:18:28.03 we went to before the pandemic started we went to Disneyland with Vanessa uh

00:18:32.02 who's one of the early bats she's one of

00:18:34.10 the people that got the bat the original bats uh emily's best friend and her

00:18:38.01 husband and so we planned to use my work trip to go to to Disneyland and so went

00:18:43.05 down there uh they were gonna meet me the next day uh Emily got in flew down I

00:18:48.13 did my panel for vidcon got out of my panel met Eric

00:18:52.01 we did a podcast a different podcast just the two of us for an on face

00:18:55.22 podcast we did the animal one got out of that podcast Emily called me and was

00:19:00.14 like uh Henry collapsed he had a heart problem we have to go back home and we

00:19:06.02 immediately got on a plane and went back to Austin henry's fine by the way he he

00:19:10.01 uh he's okay uh but uh so we had to leave in the middle of the trip and I'd

00:19:14.02 never stepped foot in Disneyland and we had to come home but we made lemonade

00:19:18.13 because Gavin and I went jet skiing on Sunday

00:19:20.13 I see you've posted a video oh yeah yeah I meant to say Devon I went jet skiing

00:19:24.00 and then at that point in my head the video would play for everybody okay you

00:19:27.13 probably have to hit play oh yeah play on this okay I'm anticipating this

00:19:32.02 being a certain thing I'm gonna watch this it's eight seconds.

00:19:38.20 [Music]

00:19:40.10 I feel like that was the least thrilling version of what just happened but that

00:19:44.19 is definitely that's definitely a bucket list item

00:19:49.05 that is a high seas high five buddy Gavin and I

00:19:51.17 get a high five on jet skis and that cheer that that like shout from me after

00:19:56.10 it happens that isn't me cheering that's me screaming in agony because it hurts

00:20:00.21 so much even at like five miles an hour which I

00:20:03.22 think is the slowest I can go on that thing

00:20:07.20 so much my hand hurt for like four hours after we went

00:20:11.23 I kept looking over and he was like she shook it for the rest of the day

00:20:16.08 so we're working our way up though that's a five mile an hour high five on

00:20:21.08 jet skis yes we that's the final attempt we did

00:20:24.10 it three times the first time we did definitely hit each other

00:20:28.23 one before that we high fived and I immediately crashed into Geoff's jet ski

00:20:34.14 which caused Emily to like rock back and accidentally stop recording oh no

00:20:39.19 so next time we don't have a video of that

00:20:42.20 but this one we did yeah oh I feel like that's the better video honestly

00:20:46.19 but this was a much better high five the one that Gavin should yeah but I feel

00:20:50.02 like the footage is better for the other one than just this is just like a

00:20:54.01 it's good but it's not I don't know so the next

00:20:57.11 next step is we gotta hit ramps we're gonna do it in the air

00:21:01.01 that's a huge step that's what do you mean that's the next step I feel like

00:21:05.02 there's so many steps between those two things what about aiming for like seven

00:21:10.04 miles per hour instead of adding air oh there's this is this another one is

00:21:15.07 this the crash one this is where I yell at him

00:21:21.07 see you're riding it up well that's a good one again there's a little bit of

00:21:28.17 that was the bump and then Emily almost fell off and stopped actually and what

00:21:34.11 you can't see really I'm like stuck sideways at the beginning

00:21:37.13 because for some reason the jet ski turned off so for the for the run-up of

00:21:40.21 that I'm trying to figure out how to turn on my jet ski again that was fun

00:21:46.09 yeah I mean it looks great I think it's a great starting point we definitely now

00:21:50.18 know that this is possible oh super possible super possible working out the

00:21:55.18 specific good proof of concept Santa yeah it's a great way to put it

00:21:59.00 the most badass bike stunt starts with the smallest of bunny hops it takes a

00:22:02.23 little bit of time yeah work your way we're gonna get there we're gonna get

00:22:05.22 there I can't wait and Gavin and I made a lot

00:22:09.11 of lemonade out of the fact that I have had two vacations in a row cancelled and

00:22:14.21 this one literally I fl Emily we flew to la uh

00:22:17.15 Emily flew to I.a had lunch and then got back on a plane and went home

00:22:22.19 in the same bed the whole time oh that's terrible oh my god

00:22:26.23 uh speaking of another uh adorable thing Henry did let me show you a photo

00:22:32.04 I'll uh oh man is it the least favorite thing for you guys

00:22:37.20 when I have to uh try to do stuff really well it depends sometimes it can be so

00:22:43.14 bad it's great if it's just in the middle it's not as fun

00:22:47.07 this is on the day before we left for for

00:22:50.21 los Angeles I was working on my laptop and I set it down on this little bench

00:22:56.13 little leather bench behind my bed and when I came back five minutes later

00:23:01.14 see Henry uh Henry is uh he's he's an elder gentleman now so uh

00:23:06.22 we dress him at all times in a bow tie and a diaper because he's uh he has

00:23:11.22 accidents I forgot to put the diaper on him and he he peed

00:23:17.05 37 gallons directly onto my laptop so when I came back to pick up my laptop

00:23:24.23 it's just urine fell out of all the ports that's so much piss

00:23:30.02 there's a colossal about piss can we install how unironically the picture's

00:23:35.08 the wrong way as well yeah well it's me I was thinking about the classic Geoff

00:23:40.00 photo uh so I uh had to buy a new laptop that day that guy no yeah

00:23:46.00 oh no straight up dead uh he didn't mean it

00:23:49.07 no I can't that's so much it looks like a rorschach of piss like the way that it

00:23:55.01 bends and out of all the places from the pee I'm glad it was on my laptop

00:24:02.04 piss boiled I got a brand new uh macbook air so I mean it's the m1 chip set hey

00:24:08.02 congratulations it's a brand new old macbook it's obsolete as of July but yeah

00:24:14.19 I needed the laptop for work so what am I gonna do did you just wait a month for

00:24:20.08 you know to not have a laptop no

00:24:23.14 okay uh another funny thing while we're talking about [ __ ] that's costing me

00:24:28.21 money uh did I tell you guys that I I I wrecked my car recently no

00:24:33.20 I don't you wrecked my car I wrecked your car not bad not bad so I have a one

00:24:39.11 I have two cars and a one car garage or one car driveway and so when I had my

00:24:45.08 yard work done I had them like eek out as much of a

00:24:49.03 second area as possible so now I have like a one and three quarter driveway so

00:24:54.10 to get my car in the driveway requires some like Austin power sing around [ __ ]

00:24:59.03 but I'm used to it I'm good at it I I I enjoy the challenge but the other day I

00:25:02.06 was in a hurry about a month ago I was in a hurry and I just I was just like

00:25:06.06 taking Milly somewhere and I was stressed out and I wasn't paying

00:25:08.22 attention and I I clipped this pole pulling out of my driveway and so I just

00:25:14.02 scraped a bunch of paint off the driver's side of my uh passenger or my

00:25:18.17 rear door and so I took it to a collision place or

00:25:21.09 I took it to bmw and then they told me to place to get it repaired and so I

00:25:25.06 took it to these guys I had to get on a waiting list for three weeks because

00:25:29.12 they're so busy finally last Wednesday I dropped it off because I was

00:25:34.08 going out of town I was going to be at you know

00:25:36.20 vidcon in Disneyland and whatnot I uh I drop it off and then I start immediately

00:25:41.19 getting like really verbose texts from them like hey just want to let you know

00:25:44.21 we removed the quarter panel and we started spraying the quarter panel and

00:25:47.21 when that's done then we're gonna do this and that and just like a ton of

00:25:51.00 information it's like really cool then at Friday while Emily and I were uh

00:25:55.05 running around trying to get back to Austin uh I missed a couple phone calls

00:25:59.00 and I thought that's weird and I was ignoring it cause I was trying to drive

00:26:03.05 from anaheim back to lax and book a flight and stuff and uh

00:26:07.08 I got a text after that that was like hey it's so so-and-so from the collision

00:26:11.08 place uh hey give me a call on Monday about your about your car when you get a

00:26:15.04 chance and I looked at Emily and I thought that's bad and she's like what

00:26:18.06 do you mean he just wants you to talk on

00:26:20.19 Monday and I'm like yeah but every other text I've gotten from these guys has

00:26:24.02 been really informed like overly so you know and uh and this is just sort of a

00:26:29.22 sort of hey just give me a call when you

00:26:31.19 get a chance uh very vague and I thought like that's not they've they've done

00:26:35.08 something to my car and she's like you're being paranoid so this morning

00:26:39.12 when I woke up the first thing I did was called him and

00:26:42.16 he was like yeah gee uh really sorry about this um we had your car all ready

00:26:46.12 it was all painted and we got it all set up and then we were gonna drive it over

00:26:50.12 to bmw for a certification we got to certify these you know cameras or

00:26:53.19 whatever and get them calibrated there and uh well we were pulling out and uh

00:26:59.07 well uh we hit we got into a car accident with your car and no no

00:27:04.15 they wrecked my car after they fixed it they wrecked it so

00:27:08.12 they're like you know obviously we're gonna repair it and we'll get it

00:27:13.11 certified by bmw and it won't cost you a dime and we're really sorry but we're

00:27:18.02 gonna need it another week because we erect your car

00:27:21.11 what do they do do they hit another car or they just

00:27:25.16 they got something somebody that somebody in a truck ran into it oh my god

00:27:36.15 while they so when do you you get your car back

00:27:40.12 next week at this point I was supposed to get it today

00:27:45.13 now I think hopefully I get it Friday Emily was like man you were way cooler

00:27:49.20 about that than I would have been and I was just like what are you gonna do I

00:27:53.09 mean [ __ ] well I mean as long as it's there sure it's right it's just yeah

00:27:56.13 they're fixing it but it's like okay at this point like sure why not throw it on

00:28:00.20 the pile [ __ ]

00:28:05.16 we already ate two entire vacations to Vegas and Disneyland in the last two

00:28:10.19 weeks why not I just bought a new laptop for no reason like

00:28:14.12 I should have looked at the Russian to see if there's a car crashing that I

00:28:19.12 could spot [Laughter]

00:28:22.06 so when did the laptop happen in relation to the car was this after

00:28:26.21 yeah I the laptop had I dropped the car off Wednesday morning

00:28:31.01 Henry Pete on the laptop Wednesday afternoon

00:28:34.13 okay so you didn't know that your car was gonna get distracted I didn't find

00:28:39.11 out my car was destroyed until well today but I had I had an

00:28:42.17 inkling on Friday evening yeah something was wrong yeah or maybe

00:28:46.21 Tuesday I dropped my car anyway yeah it had been over a couple weeks so

00:28:52.02 so apart from the course uh things are uh things are going about like uh

00:28:55.16 like pretty s pretty normal in Geoff's world just want to give you guys an

00:28:59.11 update well I almost said in bed in bed this morning

00:29:02.14 I told Emily I said on the bright side at least nothing's happened to the and

00:29:07.03 she goes shut up so I didn't I didn't actually say it out

00:29:10.12 loud it's an annoying step to verify the cameras is it like if they swap parts

00:29:15.10 they don't don't work until bmw sign off on it I don't know I think I think

00:29:19.18 because it's like it's a bmw like certifies their cars and

00:29:24.00 the repairs and stuff so they only work with certain uh body shops and then

00:29:29.16 there's a yeah I guess they have to like sign off on it I don't know [Applause]

00:29:36.08 I'm on my phone quite a bit uh whether it's using social media apps or maybe

00:29:42.02 getting food delivered and all sorts of reasons why I use it uh but the scary

00:29:46.08 part is is that your phone carrier collects data on whatever it is you're

00:29:49.23 doing verizon is even admitted to it they say it so that they can better

00:29:53.09 understand your interest but really all they want is to sell your activity to

00:29:56.20 advertisers stuff like the sites you visited and what you've been up to

00:30:00.03 online the more they can get on you the larger their paycheck becomes which is

00:30:04.12 why I use expressvpn expressvpn is an app that prevents your phone carrier

00:30:08.04 from being able to see the sites that you visit and sell it off to third

00:30:11.16 parties all it takes is one tap of a button and all of your network data gets

00:30:16.11 encrypted and rerouted through expressvpn's secure servers for ultimate

00:30:20.12 privacy not only does it shield your web

00:30:23.00 browsing expressvpn protects all of your network data so you can stay private

00:30:27.14 even when using your favorite apps whether you're an iPhone android or even

00:30:31.20 a tablet user expressvpn works on all your devices the best part is one

00:30:36.12 subscription can be used on up to five devices at the same time I have my whole

00:30:41.07 family using expressvpn too when your phone carrier tracks you that's a gross

00:30:45.17 invasion of privacy you can either keep letting them cash in on you or visit

00:30:51.03 expressvpn face to get the same vpn I use take back

00:30:54.12 your online privacy today and use my link to get three extra months free

00:30:59.14 that's e x p r e s s v n face expressvpn.com face

00:34:00.02 so I might be able to turn turn your day around a little bit Geoff with with

00:34:03.22 telling you about some victories you've had against me without even knowing it

00:34:08.11 I'm also I'm losing money too trying to fight you in ways you don't even know

00:34:13.10 I'm down eighty dollars I don't wanna fight why are we fighting so

00:34:18.02 this goes all the way back to when you mailed me the giant thing a bubble wrap

00:34:23.04 that was that was part one of this you you were so kind being thoughtful taking

00:34:28.01 care of me want to make sure I'm okay you sent me a giant thing a bubble wrap

00:34:33.11 from amazon so I decided that I I need to return the

00:34:37.05 favor because no you know I love giving gifts to people it's so it's such a

00:34:40.14 great feeling you know show somebody that you care about uh you love them get

00:34:45.09 them something nice so you got me the bubble wrap I was laying

00:34:49.01 in bed I couldn't sleep and I thought what would be a great gift for Geoff

00:34:53.12 and then I just thought what if what is the most amount of bananas I could send

00:34:57.08 Geoff at one time because you're a big banana guy you love bananas

00:35:02.00 so hopped sorry I would say I like bananas about as much as Emily likes swans

00:35:07.11 like an average amount I'm a b-minus banana or a b-minus banana fan

00:35:12.19 so I I went on and I made an account I use the free trial for amazon prime on

00:35:18.00 amazon.com and they have a fresh section where it's like a grocery delivery

00:35:23.12 service they have yes I'm familiar and I it was it was like 1am and I was like

00:35:27.06 you know what these are pretty cheap they're two pounds of bag I'm gonna send

00:35:32.06 Geoff a thousand pounds of bananas tomorrow I'm just gonna do this

00:35:36.04 so I did it and I had sinned and then I went to go back to sleep

00:35:40.09 again and I did this from my tablet I was in power I sent Geoff a thousand

00:35:45.14 pounds and I have a ton of bananas I sent 500 two pound bags and I hit clear

00:35:52.02 and then because I'm unfortunately not a bad

00:35:55.20 enough person I thought about it and I was like you know what

00:35:59.18 I don't I don't know what maybe something's happening in just life I

00:36:04.01 don't know a schedule I didn't want it to be like Todd

00:36:07.11 Margaret where all the food and all the animals take over the house like

00:36:11.07 like a bunch of animals would eat a thousand pounds and scatter it

00:36:14.08 everywhere and just move into your home I felt really bad about it so I

00:36:18.03 cancelled the order five minutes later and I went back to bed and I just went

00:36:24.06 about my day and that evening happened to be a very

00:36:27.18 important family dinner that I was paying for that I was going to cover it

00:36:32.08 was like this built up dinner it was very exciting I was so happy about it

00:36:36.04 and I get to the place and I give them my card and they say uh it doesn't it's

00:36:40.14 not going through and I thought oh that's weird so then I gave them my

00:36:44.17 other card and they told me yeah this one isn't

00:36:47.11 going through either and that's that's all the money I have so I'm like what is

00:36:51.08 I don't give me a minute I'm going to try to I got to figure this out so I

00:36:55.01 left and I had to search thankfully I had cash I never have cash I just

00:36:59.06 happened to have cash I was able to pay for it but I couldn't figure out what

00:37:03.18 was wrong and so I was looking at my phone and they they deactivated my account

00:37:07.23 because I bought so many bananas they thought it was a fraudulent charge I got

00:37:12.08 a text at like 2 a.m that I just hadn't I didn't notice

00:37:15.20 and my account had been locked the entire time so then I was on hold for

00:37:19.17 like two hours that evening trying to get them to unlock my account didn't

00:37:23.17 work so I've lost I've lost time at this point for Geoff and this this issue

00:37:28.20 and that fell apart it was a disaster so I was able to get the dinner everything

00:37:32.17 was okay but I almost couldn't buy this really important built up dinner because

00:37:36.20 I bought 500 bags of bananas so that was having to explain to people

00:37:41.22 like there was a moment where I thought I might not be able to get this and

00:37:46.05 having to explain why it was ridiculous so then that happened some time passes

00:37:51.00 we're nearing episode 100 and I thought you know what this could be a great time

00:37:56.15 the way that we had to record that episode we'd have a two-hour window

00:38:01.09 I am gonna send Geoff like 600 I was reduced I realized so how

00:38:05.12 amazon fresh works is let's say you want to buy a thousand bananas you put in a

00:38:09.09 thousand and they'll say I can't do it but we do have 700. So I just always put

00:38:13.11 in a high number and see whatever the max is so for episode 100 I thought I'm

00:38:17.11 going to do this again so I signed up for amazon prime again

00:38:20.08 and I was getting ready to do it but then I had a thought of like well I

00:38:23.16 don't know you know what's going on with

00:38:26.13 Geoff and then Geoff you had uh you almost quit this podcast because of the dinger

00:38:29.09 video of missing happy so then I was like I it was you you

00:38:33.14 cannot send this man 800 pounds of bananas this is not a good time I'm

00:38:38.15 gonna just hold off on this so I held off and I hadn't thought about

00:38:43.20 it until last week I'm looking at my credit card statement

00:38:48.00 and I notice a 20 charge from amazon and I don't know what it is and I look at

00:38:52.15 all my accounts I can't figure out I didn't order anything

00:38:55.11 I realized I forgot to cancel the trial from episode 100. So I've been being

00:39:01.09 billed 20 a month for the past three months

00:39:03.16 because I just forgot to turn it off so that's I'm now down 80 dollars in

00:39:08.00 like three hours of time and I've almost ruined a family dinner then last week

00:39:12.22 I don't want to get into like the specific I had one of the worst weeks

00:39:17.14 I've had in a long time I don't know just terrible so sorry buddy and I

00:39:21.00 missed I missed a break [ __ ] because of it that I was going to be on I was

00:39:26.02 excited about it and I said so I watched it I watched on like Saturday night

00:39:31.07 and I'm having the worst week I'm just miserable not good

00:39:35.16 and you took a shot at me and it hurt my feelings because of the week as a whole

00:39:39.15 yeah I was I was angry well I that's how I felt with the dinger video I was just

00:39:43.17 that I was at a weak point and you took a shot at me when I wasn't prepared what

00:39:47.17 shot did I take I'm very sorry Eric played the sound board and then you

00:39:52.04 said that's as much as Andrew contributes normally

00:39:56.02 because it's tough and I try really hard on that show and that's like one of my

00:40:00.17 anxiety points is because I know that something you are frequently nervous

00:40:04.23 about just because it's it's live and yeah it's hard to it's hard to get words

00:40:08.11 in and none of that so I was mad at you and I thought this [ __ ] and I've

00:40:12.03 had I've just had a bad week so I thought oh you know what this guy loves

00:40:15.10 he [ __ ] loves swimming pools he loves swimming what can I do what can I do to

00:40:19.07 the kindness of my heart I noticed last time I was on there they sold gallons of

00:40:23.21 water for 89 cents each and I was like oh you know what I want to be really

00:40:27.08 nice to Geoff I'll buy him some water for his pool so when his pool gets there

00:40:31.10 he'll have the water to put it in let's buy some water for Geoff and so I went to

00:40:36.09 load up as much as they could and since 100 in that time they have changed their

00:40:40.23 system I can only send you a max everything had order amounts to it I

00:40:45.22 couldn't go for the max I can only send you three gallons at a time

00:40:49.16 and I couldn't regularly schedule it so I wanted to send you 10 gallons of water

00:40:54.12 every day for the month of July but they would only let me send three per week

00:41:00.01 so that was ruined and I was like well that was those pointless I can't even do

00:41:04.13 anything with this I'm down another 20

00:41:07.03 for another month of amazon I'm down 80

00:41:09.12 dollars in three hours and you keep beating me and you have no idea that

00:41:13.00 this is even happening it has been an infuriating one-sided losing war oh man

00:41:18.12 well for the record uh congratulations I think that you

00:41:23.01 single-handedly are changing the way Google amazon or Google amazon

00:41:27.18 you single-handedly are changing the way amazon fresh works it sounds like

00:41:32.15 they're having to put protections in place in the app because of you

00:41:36.02 uh and then I have no memory of saying that joke but it's very funny and it

00:41:39.22 sounds like something I would say so I'll take your word for it yeah I was

00:41:43.22 not happy about it are you over now are you over it now are you still mad no

00:41:48.13 I I mean I still don't love it but it's I'm not upset with you about it I mean I

00:41:53.05 didn't mean it it was just a joke do you do you think any of your bad week

00:41:58.00 originated in in your sock choice for the week oh

00:42:01.12 maybe I need to get into socks because I I don't I'm not a socks guy so maybe

00:42:07.02 have you had what are the updated results of your your sock work

00:42:11.08 um pretty okay just been still avoiding those red new ones

00:42:15.10 yeah you still haven't tried them still not still not going to use them I will

00:42:20.23 say Andrew you sent me a lovely uh birthday card it was a get well soon

00:42:26.04 card but it was reskinned as a as a birthday card it's a

00:42:29.18 banana on roller skates with a cup of coffee in a boom box and is that like a

00:42:34.12 hint he says just wanted to say yellow hope

00:42:38.02 you're peeling well and I am peeling well and I thank you for the happy

00:42:42.15 birthday card and it meant a lot to me Andrew also sent me a link to a YouTube

00:42:47.18 video and he just wrote out the link to the YouTube video in the card

00:42:51.10 and uh Emily and I both spent about 45

00:42:53.18 minutes trying to different permutations to figure out how to get it to work we

00:42:58.12 eventually gave up decided that it's just miss it he just wrote it down wrong

00:43:02.10 and uh mentioned it to him and he says I don't remember what it was

00:43:06.20 how unsatisfying yeah well okay so the thought process

00:43:10.10 with that was I just thought it was absurd to write a link in physical form

00:43:15.20 and so much work for the person who's getting it yes it was

00:43:20.00 and so I pulled up a YouTube video of a happy birthday song and then I just

00:43:24.07 changed one of the numbers and made sure it went nowhere and then I just wrote

00:43:27.21 that so everything is right but one number and I was hoping that you would

00:43:33.03 try multiple times without being annoying I didn't we tried it

00:43:37.05 I gave up and emily's like I'll try and then she tried for a while and then

00:43:41.11 eventually I was like I bet I'm in the whole the whole time I'm like I don't

00:43:45.03 know that this was ever supposed to work to begin with

00:43:47.23 this might have been the whole point of the card uh I just wanted I had a card

00:43:52.05 and I thought I'll send this to Geoff I don't know maybe I'll get into maybe

00:43:55.17 letter writing become a thing I get into Geoff had a little birthday party it was

00:44:01.18 it was quality oh yeah happy birthday to Geoff thanks man I did I forgot that was

00:44:06.02 that was two weekends ago uh we went swimming we had a little I

00:44:09.11 rented a swim or Emily rented a swimming

00:44:11.11 pool for us and we went swimming for the day did you post any videos of that I

00:44:14.20 don't think so no did you uh I don't know should we should we show

00:44:19.04 Andrew the one of you on the diving board yeah

00:44:23.11 oh there's lots of diving there's a big ass uh diving board

00:44:27.16 are you still feeling the effects of being bitten by a swan do you still feel

00:44:31.22 like 20 more graceful than no I feel I know I'm back to normal also I tried

00:44:36.21 desperately to show Gavin and meg the swan but we he was not there yesterday

00:44:41.07 it's true he did not make an appearance are you are we

00:44:44.23 waiting until do you think I think we're waiting for us okay

00:44:49.10 he's looking for his phone I did get this I'm very excited oh hey

00:44:53.18 congratulations thank you oh it's it's a it's gonna be in the slack oh okay

00:44:59.14 yeah file size too big it's just too powerful I'm excited so is this you

00:45:04.13 because you dove through a ring last time right was the last diving video we

00:45:09.18 got of you what type of dive are we looking at here I don't even know there

00:45:13.06 was that much diving that you don't even you can't recall we just don't I dove

00:45:16.15 for like four hours straight at one point I dove all my lips through

00:45:20.21 individual little hoops Gavin had the dive of the day

00:45:24.16 the absolute dive of the day we had this well watch this and then

00:45:29.12 yeah yeah I'm gonna watch this oh it's a slow motion Geoff dive

00:45:36.19 doing a little wave le queens wave transition

00:45:40.17 amazing form looks like you missed the pool entirely oh there we go there's the

00:45:46.05 water it's like an infinity pool with a diving pool on the other side

00:45:51.14 I see it just looks like I fell off the world it does it looks like you just

00:45:56.08 vanished that should be a seven second clip I'm not sure why it's a bit long

00:46:00.15 but that's that's pretty much it just like untrimmed it ah it was fun

00:46:08.12 yeah I I've never experienced a cheer so big in my life like we were just trying

00:46:12.15 to do like funny dives after a while like diving through the rubber ring and

00:46:16.10 then there were these little like tossed like was it ring toss hoops yeah

00:46:20.16 it was like blow up ring toss for like a

00:46:22.21 floating flamingo yeah and then suddenly there was just like four of them

00:46:26.17 floating in the diving area so I just I did a little springy dive jumped

00:46:30.17 straight up the air then tried to thread both legs and both arms through the

00:46:34.17 hoops and I just came crashing down on them and I couldn't really tell what

00:46:38.23 happened and then I realized as I was slowly floating to the surface being

00:46:42.12 pulled up by the hoops and I arose from the water with one on each limb and

00:46:48.10 everyone was just like ah yeah it was a really big accomplishment

00:46:53.09 he he's currently the he currently is the world champion at uh at uh limbspear.

00:46:58.12 [Laughter]

00:46:59.16 I did I did it I was like I we'd been trying it for a while my best was two I

00:47:05.02 got both legs in Emily got three two arms and a leg and then Gavin showed up

00:47:10.13 and just snailed it and then he floated to the top like in slow motion

00:47:15.07 it was it was really cool I wish we'd have been filming that moment because it

00:47:19.22 was definitely the dive of the year gavin's dive of the year hands down in

00:47:23.12 80s and 90s movies where the the movie ends on a freeze frame with like the

00:47:27.13 main guy smiling and everyone around him

00:47:29.22 to celebrate it felt like that moment it felt like

00:47:34.04 the first freeze frame moment of my life I would actually

00:47:38.12 love to see a like strictly like looked at viewed dive of the year

00:47:42.11 competition I want there to be a dive of the year like I want to be able to see

00:47:45.19 there's a leader board of what dive of the year is a dive of the year every

00:47:49.12 year would be fantastic maybe that's something we should get

00:47:54.04 into declaring the official dive of the year yeah are you a dive guy Andrew uh

00:47:59.00 no I wouldn't say I'm a die I enjoy falling the falling part is fun but not

00:48:03.18 a dive it's the coordination the lack of

00:48:06.00 coordination is really the issue with me

00:48:07.21 with the dive but the jumping off of the thing always good

00:48:11.08 yeah that was my first experience with a bouncy diving board it was very really

00:48:16.08 yeah hey uh sorry as opposed to what I was just like what do you mean

00:48:21.11 like are there a rigid one let you know if you're like a like a high dive pool

00:48:26.23 or something it's just like a big solid one instead of a springy one

00:48:30.03 yeah and this is like this is so I I consider myself pretty familiar with

00:48:35.18 diving boards uh I realized uh this is like

00:48:39.09 the diving board you would find at a public pool in the 80s that's like extra

00:48:44.02 springy like extra extra springy it's got like it's like twice the size of

00:48:48.15 like you think of a diving board in a backyard pool and you go like boiling

00:48:52.06 boiling and you go in right this thing's got hand rails it's like three times as

00:48:56.14 long as a regular diving board like this is a diving board we've been I think

00:49:00.17 probably illegal in the city of Austin but uh this is out

00:49:04.08 in the [ __ ] boonies which is why we rent it uh and we go out there and dive

00:49:08.02 a lot you can get I don't know you can get a good 15 feet in the air off this

00:49:11.14 diving board if you're jumping hard enough like it is [ __ ] serious yeah I

00:49:15.09 rewatched the video the spring is insane I don't think I've ever seen a board

00:49:18.12 with that much spring to it and then the pool that it dives into is like 12 feet

00:49:22.06 deep so you can get really nice and [ __ ] into it it's good

00:49:26.12 I like that I have no concept of the pool that you actually dive into

00:49:31.12 I haven't seen a single actual dive from the angle that you have we uh we

00:49:36.18 it was funny because I was just diving pretty much throughout the day but like

00:49:38.19 everybody else had to work their way up to diving off that diving board Trevor

00:49:42.16 all those guys were like I'll give it a shot eventually and then once everybody

00:49:45.18 did and they realized how much fun it was you couldn't keep them off it's

00:49:49.22 great hey I had a dream about you last night Gavin yeah uh

00:49:54.05 it's not good so what yeah go ahead um it was weird and I don't know what to

00:49:58.13 think about it but uh the dream started with me on your front porch

00:50:03.14 pushing your doorbell okay I'm pushing the doorbell and then I

00:50:07.17 push the doorbell and as soon as I push it I think why did I do that and then I

00:50:11.18 looked down and I'm like why am I why am I on Gavin and meg's front porch am I

00:50:16.01 bringing something to them and I look around like I must be delivering

00:50:19.05 something to them and I look around and I got nothing and I'm like did I forget

00:50:20.12 it what did I forget what was I bringing am I even bringing something was I

00:50:24.12 supposed to tell them something what am I supposed to tell them and then I

00:50:28.04 thought oh no what time of day is it is it even like

00:50:31.06 an appropriate time to ring their doorbell and I look at my watch and it's

00:50:34.15 9am and I think is 9 am appropriate is it too early it's a little early and

00:50:39.20 then I'm like how did I get here and right then uh I hear Gavin and meg

00:50:44.10 like because it's a dream right so I hear them in their bedroom in bed

00:50:49.07 like clearly as if it's like filtered into the house and I hear it Gavin go

00:50:52.20 what oh whoa rings a doorbell and meg's like

00:50:56.21 it's too early in the morning and he's like we're still in bed and they're just

00:51:02.16 like narrating all of my fears he's like I got

00:51:06.12 it better be important and meg's like it's not going to be important it's not

00:51:09.21 going to be worth it don't go and he's like I've got to they rang the bell they

00:51:15.07 wouldn't if they didn't need me and I'm like oh [ __ ] and gavin's like I've got

00:51:19.12 to put shoes on and I can like hear him putting shoes on in the bedroom and I'm

00:51:23.20 like oh [ __ ] I'm screwed what do I do he's going to be so mad at me meg's

00:51:27.16 going to hate me and I'm like looking where to hide and I'm like trying to

00:51:30.17 hide behind a plant that's on your thing I'm like that's not going to work and I

00:51:34.02 run into your garage and I can't get your garage open and then I'm like oh

00:51:35.11 I'm tampering with their house and then I run around the other side and there's

00:51:38.20 like a fence and I'm like just trying to figure out where to hide so that you

00:51:42.04 don't get mad at yelling at me and then I'd like then I realized oh my god

00:51:45.14 he's got cameras he'll just see me running around his house I better just

00:51:49.04 face the music and I'm like oh so I just

00:51:51.07 like [ __ ] it and I walk up to the front

00:51:53.01 door and I like have my head down and I just stand in front of your front door

00:51:56.17 and I can just hear you coming through the house going I just can't [ __ ]

00:52:00.01 believe it's a Saturday I went weird and meg's like tell him to go away and I

00:52:04.12 could just hear you stomping and they're like oh the cat's in the way and like

00:52:08.03 and then why did you get to the door and I can hear you like opening the front

00:52:11.03 door and I'm like this is going to end our friendship and then I woke up

00:52:16.13 you the saddest part about that dream is

00:52:19.16 there's an alternate version where it's just the entire time gavin's struggling

00:52:24.12 with an unflushable toilet that's the real yeah yeah yeah I'm

00:52:28.12 surprised you didn't hear me checking the brake

00:52:31.05 no no none of that made it into the dream it just was it wasn't even you

00:52:34.21 trying to turn off my morning [ __ ]

00:52:36.21 no no I didn't know why I was there and then I was so scared that I had

00:52:41.00 inconvenienced you and meg and that it was gonna end our friendship and you

00:52:44.06 were so and I was just like terrified hearing you stomp down a hallway

00:52:48.13 uh to get to the front door and then right when you were about to let me have

00:52:52.23 it I woke up I mean that could all be real except I

00:52:56.06 I you would never be terrified yeah I was gonna I'm gonna ask have you ever

00:53:01.19 been intimidated by Gavin no charity I don't think anyone ever has

00:53:06.13 I hit him too hard once and I felt really bad about it but I wasn't

00:53:09.12 intimidated I just felt guilty oh what was that one it was where we

00:53:14.17 were at a we were at mcm in London me you and dan and I think ben

00:53:18.13 king were selling like griff balls out of a booth and I smacked you in the side

00:53:24.04 of the head but I I hit you like on the ear really hard and it was solid and you

00:53:28.04 looked at me like like what the [ __ ] is wrong with you

00:53:32.06 I shouldn't have done that I feel bad and then you shook it off but you were

00:53:37.05 legitimate shake it up did I get you back do you think

00:53:41.11 no I don't think so oh I think you were too mad to get me back or maybe you

00:53:47.03 didn't I never knew about it that was the year we watched dan pee in

00:53:51.12 that vodka bottle and overfill it yeah it was at those conventions there wasn't

00:53:55.22 that we knew about any sort of like vendor

00:53:58.17 exclusive toilet so you just kind of had to get in the big line and uh dan was

00:54:03.11 really busting and uh he'd also just been slowly

00:54:06.15 working his way through this bottle of vodka I think all of us had at the booth

00:54:10.03 and then he decided he would just piss in that and it was like it was it was a

00:54:13.19 pretty sizable bottle yeah but he underestimated the size of his bladder

00:54:19.12 and he completely brimmed this bottle and he didn't know what to do so he was

00:54:23.05 just like he's like what would you be oh no oh no and then he just ended up

00:54:28.03 with like the bottle cap in one hand the bottle in the other both of his hands

00:54:32.21 went up and he just had to like ride it out it was just pissing on the carpet

00:54:38.21 no three foot from people in the [ __ ]

00:54:41.20 line to my teeth yeah it was like round the back of the stump

00:54:46.06 behind a wall of boxes and a crack on an animal

00:54:50.04 oh man have you guys seen uh have you guys seen Jurassic park the new one no

00:54:55.12 no no Emily and I saw it with our new found time in Austin and uh it's not good

00:55:01.07 first off and it's 100 it's 100 hours long it's a very long it's got some

00:55:05.05 funny moments Geoff goldblum's funny there's a few it's got some terrible

00:55:09.11 characters uh I can't I I'd say it's about as bad as the previous one um

00:55:13.04 but you know it's cool to see dinosaurs and stuff but anyway we were we were

00:55:18.04 sitting at Alabama draft house and uh it was

00:55:20.18 a [ __ ] loud movie right and then I uh I had been like slipping farts out all

00:55:25.01 night long you know because I was real gassy and I think we'd eaten like

00:55:28.11 Mexican food or something earlier so I was just like ripping farts and uh but

00:55:32.17 it's so [ __ ] loud like dinosaurs are screaming and I'm just like whatever

00:55:37.18 and uh I like you what are those what are the dinosaurs that

00:55:40.23 kill Newman in the first one they spit [ __ ] at you um

00:55:44.15 I don't know what they're gonna talk about terrified me can't be easier

00:55:48.23 I think those are the little ones the campies oh okay well whatever they are

00:55:52.00 those things think campbell's got peter stormy yeah oh right right so there's a

00:55:56.15 scene where that dinosaur is about to spray on uh I think Laura Thorne maybe I

00:56:02.00 don't remember one of the characters and it just gets like insanely quiet and I

00:56:06.04 just I wasn't anticipating that part of it because it's been such a loud movie

00:56:09.17 so I like like right because it's still pretty loud I like I like try to slip

00:56:14.12 out a real quiet part but as Emily said it sounded like ripping leather it just

00:56:19.09 was like and it was right when that that tense

00:56:22.12 moment where the dinosaur and her face each other and the movie just goes

00:56:27.11 completely silent so all you could hear in the entire movie theater was my fart

00:56:32.17 and Emily goes oh my god and then started laughing

00:56:36.11 and she didn't stop laughing she was vibrating the entire rest of the movie

00:56:41.15 for the next 22 minutes laughing and I'm just going like shut up shut up shut up

00:56:47.01 and everybody in the theater heard and hated me did anyone laugh

00:56:51.12 nobody laughed but Emily but you heard you could hear Emily laughing for a long

00:56:56.07 time and I was like I was just trying to

00:56:58.09 hold it in because if I started laughing it would have been over

00:57:01.12 um and so I just like sat there and ate my laughs for like 20 minutes and just

00:57:06.00 while she just like like [ __ ] shook in her chair was this early enough in

00:57:09.23 the movie that people were still eating uh it was probably 30 minutes to go oh

00:57:13.18 okay so everyone's probably done with their food probably not with their food

00:57:18.00 at that point yeah dude speaking of farts I've uh I've started using a cpap

00:57:22.18 because I did a sleep study and they were like yeah you know got a little bit

00:57:25.22 of apnea are you can you do a surgery or something to eliminate it or are you

00:57:29.18 just gonna do cpapping uh I think figured I'd try cpap see what

00:57:32.23 goes on just I basically just wear a hose on the front of my face going up my

00:57:37.22 nose and and it's I'm annoyed to be honest that I've got sort of shrunken

00:57:43.03 nostrils considering the size of my nose it's like

00:57:45.12 I imagine it like you know when you find old aperture science in portal 2 and

00:57:49.15 there's that giant vault door yeah and then and then you move the other word

00:57:53.20 it's just a regular like eight foot humidor

00:57:56.19 that's my nostrils with the nose around it

00:58:00.08 so I got this thing going over my head and uh it like sits under my nose and

00:58:04.11 then and it ramps up the pressure so it detects when you fall asleep

00:58:08.08 giving you like small pressure and then when you fall asleep it starts like

00:58:11.09 really blasting air in and uh I think it's like two hours after I fall

00:58:16.15 asleep I keep waking up completely full of air it's not working

00:58:20.21 right at some point I guess my throat is just going the wrong way and

00:58:25.22 it is just filling my stomach with air and I'm waking up

00:58:31.05 like completely full like a balloon I keep waking up at like three in the

00:58:35.22 morning just like oh my god I'm there just like I wake up and I pull the thing

00:58:41.01 off my face I'm like and I do like that massive burp and I'm like oh my god

00:58:46.15 and then I'm like go ogling like my seat perhaps filling me with air and there's

00:58:50.23 like oh yeah it's a pretty common thing that could happen and I I was really

00:58:54.06 like how to get rid of it it's just like well you know sit on a toilet and just

00:58:58.08 fly all out so I got up it's like three in the morning and I'm not a big fart

00:59:04.02 guy I've got the wimpiest farts Geoff can attest to this I said I sat down

00:59:09.12 at three in the morning on the bowl and it was just like [Music]

00:59:15.01 like an extended sustained 45 second part and I'm just like feeling

00:59:19.16 myself get smaller like a balloon and I'm just like shrinking down as I'm

00:59:24.10 fighting and a lot of it is still it's quite satisfying to get all the air out

00:59:30.04 but I just don't know how to use the cpap I don't know why it's going down my

00:59:35.06 esophagus I can't keep it in my lungs as soon as that thing kicks up to full

00:59:40.11 pressure it's just filling up my gut

00:59:44.00 so if there's any papas out there who's do you have any tips

00:59:49.03 I think I think gus and jack both use if I'm not wrong uh

00:59:52.19 because jack had the surgery didn't he uh maybe he doesn't use it anymore

00:59:56.17 because he had the surgery but I know he used to use the scene but I hate it and

01:00:00.14 it's so uncomfortable and I've uh it and I've become a fart guy I'm I'm

01:00:05.05 really sort of firing them out now that's incredible

01:00:08.12 can you like it sounds like you can replicate this so you could set it up to

01:00:12.02 record when you go to the bathroom and you could see how long of a part you

01:00:16.06 could do oh definitely definitely record your record your next

01:00:21.12 your your next bloated fart it reminds me there is this old Kenny

01:00:26.08 versus spending episode where it's like these two guys to do competitions and

01:00:30.21 one was like who could have the biggest fart and one of them

01:00:33.23 shoved a hose up his ass and would blow air into it and then walk up and have

01:00:38.05 these massive farts in front of the other guy just to intimidate him you're

01:00:41.22 just living that life you're just naturally doing that trying to correct

01:00:45.12 yourself getting filled up in my sleep isn't it [ __ ] [ __ ] that you try

01:00:50.10 to do anything to make your life better and it just makes it worse like here you

01:00:55.10 are you're just trying to sleep better so you get a cpap machine and then it

01:00:59.14 tries to kill you yeah I'm just trying to sleep better so because

01:01:03.05 if we haven't explained sleep apnea it's

01:01:05.01 kind of where you just stop breathing in the night you like snore and then you

01:01:10.17 stop and then the cpap just keeps a constant pressure of air

01:01:14.07 down your throat down your lungs just to

01:01:16.10 stop you from stopping breathing because it can lead to like

01:01:18.23 strokes and all this bad crap so I'm just trying to get ahead of that but

01:01:23.06 the way that the insurance works it's like linked to their service or whatever

01:01:29.03 so I need to use it for a minimum of four hours every night for like 21 out

01:01:33.02 of 30 nights and I've had it for a week and I've not completed four hours just

01:01:38.10 because I keep getting filled like three hours a night

01:01:41.08 which means that if I don't meet the requirement insurance doesn't pay for

01:01:46.10 any more and I get bills for like 2500 for this stupid um

01:01:50.06 what's basically an air pump for my gut pain

01:01:56.04 yeah to be filled with air for nightly fart inflation yeah it's [ __ ]

01:02:02.06 so hey tips welcome so you went from not having any air to

01:02:07.03 weigh too much air you you there's no milk

01:02:10.23 and I was hoping that it would make me feel more rested I'm having the most

01:02:15.22 miserable nights of sleep it's all disjointed

01:02:19.13 maybe two hours and I'm fighting for one hour and I'm back to sleep

01:02:24.00 maybe you should try the maybe you should try the flow the other way and

01:02:29.12 stick the cpap up your butt and try to blow the parts out the other side

01:02:37.16 wow this was quite an episode we covered a lot of ground uh

01:02:42.02 I guess we should probably stop uh because nick asked us to and I respect

01:02:47.03 nick in a way that I can't Eric uh so let me just say uh Gavin for your

01:02:53.01 your cpap revelations thank you that is that has benefited the deep lore of

01:03:00.19 faith immensely and Andrew uh I cannot uh overstate uh how important it was

01:03:07.07 that you secured the tuxedo for the for it's this is for ripken's believe it

01:03:12.11 because why not uh new lines of business there's no telling maybe maybe we'll

01:03:17.13 recreate the tuxedo shot for shot with Gavin in the tuxedo who knows the the

01:03:23.02 the possibilities are limitless I just did I just did a uh a panel about like

01:03:28.11 podcasting as a business and video podcasting and stuff and I use the port a

01:03:33.14 potty as an example of like how to thread merch and content together

01:03:38.03 and I just going through like all the stuff that we've done with the port a

01:03:41.04 potty and then like all the things that we still can and potentially will do

01:03:45.04 with the port a potty from like the like the phone box stuffing to the the record

01:03:50.08 the vinyl all that stuff the museum the the tuxedo is like that times tin I

01:03:55.16 cannot imagine the content we'll have thanks to this tuxedo uh yeah what a

01:03:59.15 great thing for the redemption year what a great thing and I'm telling you you

01:04:03.20 gotta you gotta get out of Greg free card with me buddy

01:04:06.12 anytime you wanna I'm I'm excited to have that I'm gonna I'm gonna remember

01:04:10.02 that I'm gonna keep that in my pocket it's gonna be a clear thing you could

01:04:13.12 have you could shut me you could have shut me

01:04:16.14 down like that could have ended the tater tot thing right there you could've

01:04:20.01 just been like boom [Laughter]

01:04:22.10 I'm excited to use that one day because I absolutely am going to need it

01:04:27.18 undeniably there will be more greggy in the future by me I like that we ended up

01:04:33.00 with potentially two items for a museum I don't know what what's going to happen

01:04:37.11 with gavin's cpap if he needs to get a new machine I think that's a fantastic

01:04:41.12 museum piece well also we'll have the wave form of him farting and we'll be

01:04:47.01 able to display that by cb recordings [Laughter]

01:04:51.03 it looks like a heart getting adrenaline shoved into it the waveform of it this

01:04:56.13 is massive spikes do you think that in the like in the universe of the show the

01:05:02.18 tuxedo had a cpap in it that he could have deployed whenever he needed

01:05:08.04 I think he slept in it

01:05:11.20 it did everything he just had to turn jail and it turned the dial to cpap

01:05:16.23 I still want to know what mashed potatoes mode is

01:05:20.23 I'm still thinking about it they never explained what the dots

01:05:25.07 yeah probably is that the mashed potatoes I thought that was just dance

01:05:28.23 no there was like a variety of options that they never used in the movie mashed

01:05:32.16 potatoes is one of them a mashed potato is a dance but it could just be a fun

01:05:36.06 wait it is it is but it doesn't it doesn't mean it had to be that dance it

01:05:39.19 could have been anything if you hadn't blown it with the director we could have

01:05:44.12 asked him on this podcast well you know maybe this tuxedo is another

01:05:48.07 bridge another I could extend another olive branch yeah just be like hey just

01:05:52.08 want you to know we now own the tuxedo from the tuxedo also one quick question

01:05:56.17 what was mashed potato mode I think that was one of my last email I

01:06:01.07 sent him had a variety of questions that

01:06:03.12 was one of them I believe was what is it and how were they decided

01:06:09.01 all right well I guess we should probably wrap up dance uh thank you for

01:06:14.10 listening to another episode of the F**kFuckFacePodcast

01:06:17.21 uh I hope you've enjoyed it this has been a lively one if you did enjoy it or

01:06:23.21 maybe uh you just uh I don't know uh accepted that it happened maybe you are

01:06:28.19 totally ambivalent towards it maybe you didn't even think it was a particularly

01:06:33.22 good episode either way uh lie about it and tell somebody it was great and then

01:06:39.03 uh give us a bunch of stars bye this dance sucks hey guys major league
