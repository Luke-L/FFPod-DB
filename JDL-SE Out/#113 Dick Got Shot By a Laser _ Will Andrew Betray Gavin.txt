00:01:22.08 panton uh nick and Eric look who decided to show up

00:01:31.14 thanks Audrey you're welcome I got you.

00:01:37.16 I was like pulling teeth that was worse than the first one I don't know

00:01:42.21 I was rather so I thought we didn't mention it I was so excited

00:01:48.00 and I noticed no one gave it to me oh god episode 113 I believe

00:01:55.03 oh right yeah yeah yeah he did that already anyway yeah so you dick got shot

00:02:00.06 by a laser or something I don't know how

00:02:02.21 to do this works what happened uh oh you talking about my I got a vasectomy okay

00:02:07.07 uh I got what's tonight Thursday I got it on Tuesday morning and uh let me tell

00:02:11.20 you it's no big deal they said it was nothing to be worried about uh I will

00:02:15.20 tell you what I made one mistake uh so if I can provide a little bit of uh

00:02:21.04 knowledge for any perspective vasectomies uh the the way it went down is by the

00:02:26.17 way I was in and out in 45 minutes like it is such a non-event um

00:02:31.05 I you go like they gave me a valium to take I took a valium and then they were

00:02:35.18 like you should be good to go now just lay on

00:02:38.08 this table and I was like oh there's nothing else and they're like well you

00:02:41.09 could have laughing gas and I was like that sounds great I'll do

00:02:45.18 that and they go well it's 95

00:02:47.12 and I was like cool I'll take three I was like just [ __ ] I'll just

00:02:52.02 give me give me an order of seven laughing gas then uh so anyway I stick a

00:02:55.23 little laughing gas through my mouth and then uh then I was just having a good

00:02:59.16 time uh here's what I will say everything

00:03:02.23 went fine the doctor was really cool uh the urologist he talked a lot about jet

00:03:07.02 skiing actually on lake Austin so we had jet skiing to talk about uh but then at

00:03:11.22 one point he goes man you did a really shitty job shaving your balls and he

00:03:16.12 didn't say it in a like a funny way he was like really agitated and so I guess

00:03:20.14 and I was like oh man was that [ __ ]

00:03:22.15 terrible yeah we were supposed to shave the area

00:03:25.06 and I thought I did but uh I'm not to his uh not to his specifications so

00:03:29.16 here's what I say if you're gonna get a vasectomy shave your balls really well

00:03:32.19 because they don't like it they get annoyed so what was the issue you just

00:03:36.05 missed big clumps or it was like two the

00:03:38.08 stubble was too long I guess it's double

00:03:40.06 I don't know I didn't get into it I mean

00:03:42.06 I was on a valium and having gas and and he was like he had like

00:03:46.21 you know he'd cut my dick open and had tubes in it and stuff so um

00:03:52.04 yeah so that that's the hardest part of the hardest part about getting a

00:03:55.14 vasectomy is the appropriate uh that you fee you hear from the urologist

00:04:00.22 if you don't shave shave your balls well so shave it it's so hard to shave the

00:04:04.15 balls I don't know how you can I don't know how to do it right apparently I

00:04:08.15 don't either so I can provide you with no guidance

00:04:11.07 did you get a wet shave or just a little buzz I shaved in the shower with a

00:04:14.21 straight razor I don't like to use the buzzers because

00:04:17.13 they always like straight razors and hurt it's like like a face razor yeah

00:04:21.23 okay that's different not like a cut throat bobbitt not like you're just yeah

00:04:26.10 no you're hotting your balls yeah I'm not gonna yeah exactly

00:04:30.11 this isn't gangs of new york I always think of that scene in the

00:04:34.23 peter pan Disney thing where like smee is shaving the seagull by accident with

00:04:40.04 that cutthroat razor you know what about no

00:04:42.15 like the old animated one yeah it's like set on captain hook's towel and he

00:04:46.12 thinks it's his head and then the seagull flies off and he thinks his head

00:04:49.22 went oh that's familiar yeah it's a great I loved it as a child I was just

00:04:55.16 imagining Geoff like toweling up his his balls with a warm towel again

00:04:59.15 crack it on with a cut throat I'll tell you what is a little weird is

00:05:04.04 uh I can feel the stitches in my balls depending on how I sit and

00:05:08.08 they're not painful but it's it's just a weird feeling try to avoid feeling like

00:05:12.12 stitches yeah there it is.

00:05:17.22 I don't think I've seen that in like 20

00:05:20.12 years it kind of there's a little bit of balls imagery yeah as well the way it

00:05:26.21 it looks like balls clearly doing a better job than I did what a weird thing

00:05:32.13 for your brain to remember to just have that ready to go

00:05:36.20 I don't know where I plucked that from so

00:05:40.03 is there was I'm going to be honest is 70 I wasn't listening for that is the

00:05:44.08 laser involved you get zapped I don't think so no laser I feel like I've heard

00:05:48.20 the laser option before I'll be honest it was explained to me a bunch but I

00:05:53.14 don't I don't oh a lot of information that's fair I was probably like here's

00:05:57.22 what happened they explained the process to me at the time and I thought that

00:06:01.16 makes sense that seems safe that's acceptable I no longer need to remember

00:06:05.19 this process and so I know that I have an incision on my unlike my shaft about

00:06:10.12 the just where my shaft of my balls touch that's got like five stitches in

00:06:14.13 it and uh I know they went in there and they they did something to my vast

00:06:18.05 deference I think they like cut it in half and cauterize it or put

00:06:21.19 like some titanium caps on it like like the little ringlets that are on your

00:06:26.19 shoelaces or whatever yeah and uh something along those lines

00:06:31.03 and now I don't make babies anymore but I gotta jizz 60 times first so and I

00:06:35.09 can't I can't residue yeah you gotta jizz like 30 times and then give them a

00:06:40.21 sample and then just another 20 to 30 times and then give them a second sample

00:06:46.01 and I'm not supposed to get an erection for

00:06:50.06 another like six days so oh cause it's bad for the skin well I think you just

00:06:54.23 don't I mean I think you might pull or tug or do

00:06:58.12 something I don't think you're supposed to be using those parts while they heal

00:07:03.11 up on the inside too so um but I also haven't felt like uh

00:07:07.04 in a few moments but yeah but for the most part it's yeah you

00:07:11.08 don't want to rip a stitch for the nick says for the most part you're just like

00:07:15.16 honestly sitting on the couch with with uh like frozen peas on my nuts

00:07:19.14 wait so you have to wait a week before you have to start taking the shots yeah

00:07:24.00 they want you to what they want you to wake up they want you to wait about

00:07:27.14 eight to 14 days before you start popping off

00:07:30.13 and you got to be real gentle that's what you also uh it's also like no jet

00:07:35.20 skiing for at least a month no bike riding

00:07:39.13 holy [ __ ] I forgot I got a [ __ ] jet skiing story to tell you dude

00:07:44.03 so so Sunday I went jet skiing impromptu jet skiing when it was 113 degrees

00:07:48.14 outside because Emily and I were bored to death and we realized we were like

00:07:52.20 she was like you're not gonna be able jet ski again for like another five or

00:07:56.02 six weeks and I was like hey that's a really good point uh because I won't be

00:07:59.07 able to you know slam on my nuts and she was like let's do you want to

00:08:03.11 just like get one last jet ski in before you can't go anymore and I was like

00:08:06.15 let's [ __ ] go so we raced down there uh we knew it was gonna be hot it was

00:08:10.16 brutal uh it was actually the least fun I've ever had jet skiing uh I still had

00:08:14.08 fun but it was just like so many people out there and it was so choppy and hot

00:08:17.09 and it was just like couldn't get going couldn't go faster than like 30 the

00:08:20.17 whole time gav because it was so it was so choppy like I've never usually like

00:08:24.22 the cool thing about jet skis is if it's like really choppy at like 2030 miles

00:08:28.04 an hour you get up to 50 and it just kind of glo goes over all that smooth

00:08:31.22 yeah it was not like that it was it was not doable um so it's actually a little

00:08:37.09 stressful but here's a [ __ ] crazy jet ski story

00:08:41.12 dude when we pull up and we and you know the the dude shows up uh with four four

00:08:45.22 or six jet skis on a trailer and then you like have the conversations you sign

00:08:49.07 the paperwork and then he like puts you on jet skis and throws you in the water

00:08:54.10 well the jet ski that you used the last time Gavin in the high five video that

00:08:59.11 jet ski yeah was [ __ ] up it was on the it was on the uh

00:09:04.07 it was on the trailer and the handlebars were like hanging off to the side and

00:09:09.07 the front was all dented in and it just looked like part of the engine was like

00:09:13.08 hanging off and it looked [ __ ] someone wrecked my jet ski and Emily goes oh my

00:09:18.08 god what happened what happened to that jet ski and he goes ugh yesterday we had

00:09:23.12 a whole [ __ ] thing apparently some people rented the jet skis and uh they

00:09:29.10 were trying listen listen he this is insane first off

00:09:34.03 they got into a mid-air collision going 40 miles an hour oh no

00:09:38.23 and they said yeah we don't understand it this is what the jet ski guy told us

00:09:42.18 he was like yeah they said like yeah we were only going about 40 when we hit so

00:09:46.08 we didn't think it'd be that bad uh I don't know if you've ever been in a jet

00:09:50.10 ski 40 miles an hour on a jet ski that's very [ __ ] fast uh and they the way

00:09:54.21 they the way they did this was apparently they were jumping on the same

00:09:59.21 wake like on the same wave and at 40

00:10:02.11 miles an hour so they were that close to

00:10:04.05 each other so they were on the same wave

00:10:05.23 and so the the wave pushed them together in the air and they collided and one of

00:10:09.09 them broke their [ __ ] arm and they had to be like pulled out of the water

00:10:13.03 and like medevaced out oh Jesus that could have been us no because we're not

00:10:17.18 idiots I mean we're close we go when we do high fives we do it at a high five

00:10:22.08 miles an hour [Laughter]

00:10:24.08 we do it we're at a speed where the only other person who might be excited that

00:10:30.08 we high fived on jet skis goes yeah pretty under

00:10:33.03 yeah I I don't want to make light of this because it sounds like somebody was

00:10:36.02 mysteriously hurt but the entire time I was just waiting for a swan attack to be

00:10:39.17 responsible I looked all over for the swan it wasn't

00:10:43.18 around I was probably too hot for the swan but yeah like I so there is proof

00:10:48.05 right there uh hitting each other at 40

00:10:51.03 miles an hour uh not a good idea what about 35

00:10:54.10 uh that's we'll have to find out well 30

00:10:57.23 35 seems much safer that's crazy 40. I can't believe they're

00:11:02.18 alive collided in the air at 40 miles an hour and just dis ridiculous avoid that

00:11:08.06 [ __ ] jet ski dude I wonder what the angle was it was

00:11:12.02 the other one seemed fine I mean I rode the other one and it was totally fine so

00:11:16.16 yeah that's what happened to uh hulk hogan in bay watch macho man almost

00:11:20.14 killed him they're riding off the same wave and they went up above and much man

00:11:24.17 landed on hulk hogan he got knocked knocked unconscious

00:11:27.12 Pamela Anderson saved hulk hogan I think it was probably similar to that yeah

00:11:31.05 yeah I guess if we need a visual recreation of probably what happened

00:11:36.02 bay watch is our source we got this the wrestler you go you go to the

00:11:40.15 experts yes speaking of vehicles I meant to ask this

00:11:44.08 and the last one we recorded do you have a car now Geoff

00:11:48.00 yeah I got my car okay your car's good it didn't get crashed again on the way

00:11:52.23 no the one the one crash was was the only crash

00:11:56.07 although I will say those [ __ ]

00:11:58.18 uh it's like it couldn't be any further away from me in Austin like the absolute

00:12:04.12 ass into town and uh so I I uh I made them bring it to me because I was

00:12:09.09 like you guys [ __ ] wrecked my car you can bring it to me and they're like okay

00:12:12.22 so they bring it to me they're actually nice about it I appreciate it and then I

00:12:16.17 got a call like or I got a text like two days later and

00:12:19.16 they go hey we just realized uh we have all your tennis balls we're really sorry

00:12:23.11 about that we took him out of the trunk I guess and we forgot to put him back in

00:12:27.03 so I ran and checked and sure enough all my tennis balls are gone I have like 60

00:12:30.15 tennis balls in my trunk because you know I play tennis and uh my rackets are

00:12:35.06 still there thank god uh and he goes do you want us to bring him by and I go

00:12:39.12 well yeah obviously I want my [ __ ]

00:12:42.02 tennis balls he's like okay and then I didn't hear anything but for like five

00:12:45.05 days and then I get another text and the

00:12:45.05 guy goes hey uh we're real busy I'm real sorry I don't know when we're going to

00:12:50.17 be able to get those tennis balls to you you want

00:12:53.11 uh and I was like uh just bring them when you can I'm not driving down there

00:12:57.22 it's your [ __ ] up and they're like oh well we'll see when we can we'll try to

00:13:02.14 figure something out and I'm like see that you do thank you being firm putting

00:13:07.03 your foot down wreck my car and steal my tennis balls no

00:13:11.22 no sir that's a lot of tennis balls it is it seems like I I've played tennis I

00:13:15.23 feel like I'd never have more than six well what you can do is when you start

00:13:19.23 tennis you can go to a place like play it again sports in Austin and buy a

00:13:23.12 whole bunch of used tennis balls got it okay that's what I did I greatly

00:13:27.22 misunderstood tennis when I first started playing I started playing when I

00:13:31.12 was like I don't know six or something like that and I thought power it was all

00:13:34.23 about power not it's the opposite of what you want I was playing it like it

00:13:38.23 was baseball and so I just hit it as hard as I could every time it came to me

00:13:42.07 I was like you with the baseballs Geoff I

00:13:44.00 was hitting them at the court I was just hitting them as fast and as hard as I

00:13:47.05 could fly out they hated me I didn't play properly at all I just I

00:13:51.20 would hit them out of the court be like yeah I did it great job I got so proud

00:13:57.02 of myself do you still play I haven't played in a long time no I don't

00:14:00.02 actively play does that answer your question probably

00:14:03.04 probably wouldn't do you any favors for the uh for the marathon no would not be

00:14:07.01 helpful yeah you gotta yeah work on those ankles do you protect those angles

00:14:10.10 man you gotta protect the thing yeah I gotta put the the bubble wrap gotta

00:14:13.18 bubble wrap everything bubble wrap the court um I wonder how

00:14:18.06 long you run in a game like tennis like if you track that what the average

00:14:23.14 distance is yeah total distance I imagine soccer would be the largest

00:14:27.18 total distant moves per game yeah it's going to be several miles you'd think

00:14:32.06 yeah I'd love to know how much like a star soccer player runs and distance in a

00:14:38.06 season how many marathons they do it seems like Google could probably answer

00:14:41.22 that yeah probably I just never considered it what do you think the the

00:14:45.15 opposite of that is in the sports world the least amount of movement darts is

00:14:50.13 pretty good curling there's a person that doesn't they slide uh bowling um

00:14:55.09 golf is probably the the most distance with least effort

00:14:59.05 going from place to place yeah and you're just walking down

00:15:03.12 tennis match four to five miles wow volleyball no volleyball movement in

00:15:08.19 that no no tether ball I meant tether ball I said volleyball I meant tether ball oh

00:15:12.20 yeah there's not not a whole hell of a lot of movement in tether ball what

00:15:15.18 that's just the ball in the string yeah we're asked to go around you're trying

00:15:20.00 to get it hey Gavin I just remembered I was supposed to ask this last episode I

00:15:25.22 wrote it down um how are your cpap farts going and have you recorded any uh no

00:15:31.11 well I didn't take it to england um so I immediately voided all of my

00:15:36.15 insurance oh no because it took me over there not that I

00:15:39.20 finished any full nights anyway but I just thought because I've cause I am now

00:15:43.07 paying for it I haven't bothered to use it again yet I'm gonna try a full a full

00:15:47.18 face mask instead of the uh just under the nose one that was the

00:15:52.15 suggestion from a lot of the sea papa's out there the super paws oh please keep

00:15:56.20 us updated I had a situation the other day where I was trying to

00:16:00.17 crawl out of bed at these bathrooms so it's trying to like crawl out of bed and

00:16:05.05 not make too much noise so I'm crawling out of bed and every

00:16:08.17 every literal crawl down I'm like you know what I'm gonna be quiet I'm gonna

00:16:13.05 be very selective every time I move backwards I farted and it sounded like a

00:16:17.06 duck call it was so loud but also like short and it happened four times in a

00:16:21.21 row it was disastrous it was the last just keep doing it well no because I was

00:16:25.10 trying to move out of bed I wasn't on purpose just every time I moved a duck

00:16:28.21 call came out it was like it was blowing

00:16:30.20 a duck whistle of my ass as I was trying to get out of bed it was very loud it

00:16:35.07 was not sneaky at all but it made me think yeah the loud farts so wait you're

00:16:40.12 you're four backwards crawls away from getting out of bed uh

00:16:44.06 yeah I guess yeah I was to get from the top to the bottom yeah

00:16:48.07 oh cause you're you're starting up pillow mountain yeah because I'm on top

00:16:51.23 of mountain I need to descend I need to acclimate so there's a little pause two

00:16:56.00 down three five to get down the mountain and one to get out of it yeah exactly

00:17:01.07 yeah it was four I just remember four duck calls did you wake anyone up uh

00:17:06.07 probably almost certainly I did but yeah there's no

00:17:10.07 that's the biggest problems in your life just navigating your room

00:17:15.09 not dark at night quietly I'm disappointed I wish there were more

00:17:19.15 farts in your life I was enjoying this made me happy there's certain things

00:17:23.12 [ __ ]

00:17:24.13 That's great I hope it I I mean I hope it works for you as your friend uh but

00:17:29.18 there's also 20 of me that hopes it's somehow worse just 20.

00:17:34.21 Just 20. Yeah man there's something wrong with me okay

00:17:38.10 well there are certain things certain failings that exist in the world

00:17:42.07 that make me happy to know that they're there because I can just assume that

00:17:45.19 they've happened like you I'm assuming you still haven't fixed if

00:17:49.09 your doorbell rings while you're sitting on your toilet but it can't flush like

00:17:53.15 that that's just a thing that exists in the world that keeps me happy I might be

00:17:57.18 having like a tough moment and then I'll think about the fact you might be

00:18:01.12 sitting on a toilet right now that is unflushable that's great

00:18:06.15 I love that as well that wasn't what Geoff's dream was about no

00:18:11.10 no not at all my dream was just about dis like you being mad at me because I I

00:18:15.09 inconvenienced you by knocking on the door at the wrong time of the day

00:18:18.20 I saw an interesting comment what would your reaction be if Geoff actually did

00:18:23.03 that Gavin if he was there way too early for no reason and woke you up

00:18:27.20 what do you yeah real life what would your reaction

00:18:30.18 be uh I'd just be concerned I think you think you'd be annoyed no I wouldn't be

00:18:35.11 annoyed I'd be like oh never going to happen never not a

00:18:40.20 concern huh yeah I'd probably be like oh someone's died that would be your

00:18:45.23 assumption if Geoff showed up to your house early that somebody's dead hey man

00:18:50.12 I'm here at your house to let you know somebody died [Music]

00:18:54.13 well I wanted to see what I'm getting I could have called [Laughter]

00:19:00.04 I feel like if my phone rings I want to see I want to break your heart face to

00:19:05.05 face yeah that's a weird that's a weird move to say somebody's dead

00:19:12.04 well I mean who just shows up unannounced anyway uh have a good day

00:19:16.17 I'll see you later yeah I gotta try also here's this cucumber somebody left.

00:19:22.09 [Laughter]

00:19:23.11 Is this here I don't want to do I don't hm that

00:19:28.06 sounds terrible I hate this thing that you've created

00:19:32.08 I don't think I would go to I fortunately have not had to tell anybody

00:19:36.02 that anyone has died that's not true that actually isn't true I have had to

00:19:40.05 do but I didn't have to knock on a door I don't want to travel to do that no you

00:19:45.22 didn't nobody's making you I think it's a phone call yeah

00:19:50.02 I think yeah definitely phone call but do you leave a message

00:19:53.18 if it goes to voicemail is that message able or do you have to be

00:19:58.15 talking to the person I think it's like hey hey gab it's Geoff um

00:20:02.12 I know you're probably busy right now but I really need to talk to you uh so

00:20:06.04 if you could call me back when you get a chance

00:20:09.22 okay so you're not saying the person is dead in the voicemail

00:20:12.23 to get to talk yeah hey gab it's Geoff uh I got some weird news about Andrew call

00:20:17.05 me back is it weird news that's that's by far the worst it's like

00:20:21.16 what is that gonna be it's definitely bad but it's weird I

00:20:26.08 like the delivery of like what was was it lame beer the guy in office space

00:20:31.12 that's like yeah you're gonna have to come in on the weekend like the way you

00:20:35.22 deliver that is the same yeah somebody uh died that you know so anyway

00:20:40.17 uh if you're free to jet ski on Tuesday or Thursday anyway it's been forever

00:20:47.00 since we had dinner together that place we love did you see that

00:20:51.08 document that um I think it ended up in the red in the

00:20:55.12 subreddit for face but it was like a Reddit combined list of like setup words

00:21:00.12 and I'll just post the thing on the slack I don't know what you're talking

00:21:03.18 about I have no idea what you're talking about it's basically like on one column

00:21:06.20 you've got words like dumb and like [ __ ]

00:21:10.17 and dick and on the top you got like oh bag and basically like face is like a

00:21:15.00 very popular combination on that grid but I I just I just looked at that grid

00:21:19.16 and I thought this is a great opportunity to create some new insults

00:21:22.19 based on the least um combined you could like out of this grid you can pull

00:21:27.20 insults like scum wit and dirt hat and wank clown or

00:21:32.04 dip goblin I think they're all massively underused in socks now from Eric

00:21:39.12 it's always weird what people actually do like how some words are just meant

00:21:44.10 for other words and that's it yeah I I really like scumwit [Music]

00:21:49.18 maybe we're uh maybe we're like an insult invention podcast now maybe we

00:21:54.12 just invent new insults it's difficult I'm worried with this idea existing with

00:21:59.16 the sock idea I don't need socks that say that we don't want to popularize

00:22:04.01 oh should this be the word grid

00:22:07.05 two at a time from smee yeah honey where's my piss [ __ ] socks [Laughter]

00:22:16.04 I'm never wearing the pistol I've got that important dinner tonight

00:22:20.21 they're cursed every time I wear my piss [ __ ] socks

00:22:24.12 somebody knocks on my door and says someone's died [Laughter]

00:22:30.08 first time I thought it was unfortunate but twice

00:22:34.10 I've much better luck with my trump nozzle socks

00:22:41.05 oh what a weird I I really I really think that there's something to these socks

00:22:48.06 the soul yeah I know you do there's zero doubt that you do that was

00:22:52.17 never in question you're all about the socks

00:22:57.01 this is an interesting episode to record because this will

00:23:01.07 this will come out two weeks from now I believe okay I think the last one is

00:23:06.00 next week right and and this this upcoming week Gavin and iron

00:23:09.23 survive block island and we won't be able to talk about it for quite a while

00:23:14.22 but there are things that could happen in that show

00:23:18.17 that could impact how we interact with each other going forward for some amount

00:23:23.09 of time you mean it may affect our friendship going forward temporarily

00:23:26.21 well I don't know about forever I do you think so I'm counting on it this is

00:23:31.23 I think it's sort of an interesting point to like let me ask you honestly

00:23:35.13 right now before it all starts are you going to stab me in the back no

00:23:39.20 this is my belief and we'll see what happens I have no intention on stabbing

00:23:44.21 you in the back I don't think we'll I don't think we'll be on the same teams

00:23:50.06 would be my guess so we'd have to make merch in my

00:23:53.02 assumption for for us to play together but I have no intention on stabbing you

00:23:57.06 in the back but feel like you will probably stab me in the back out of the

00:24:01.09 assumption that I plan on stabbing you in the back that is my prediction hmm I

00:24:06.13 feel like I'm quite trustworthy as a friend yeah I gotta I gotta

00:24:11.02 step in and say that in the grand scheme of things I think Andrew is gonna stab

00:24:16.14 Gavin in the back 11 times before Gavin considers doing it once

00:24:20.11 no I think I'd I'll have a knife in my back before I know what the teams are

00:24:25.20 yeah that's absolutely not true um I just wanna like

00:24:29.11 this is gonna be clipped out later when Andrew inevitably stabs

00:24:34.02 and I just want everyone to listen to the way Andrew set up everything

00:24:39.16 this is his belief he has no intention he thinks Gavin might betray him because

00:24:44.23 Gavin thinks that andrew's going to be the one who betrays it it is all set up

00:24:50.02 for Andrew to have these outs it is all it is all predicated on well I didn't

00:24:57.16 think that I wouldn't maybe think about trying to even do it once maybe

00:25:02.15 incredible also something to consider uh is this is you guys are filming this

00:25:08.15 next week and if you're uh uninformed in

00:25:11.18 the audience of what we're talking about uh rooster teeth makes a a show

00:25:17.12 in mine craft that's essentially survivor the tv show survivor but uh

00:25:21.05 performed in the video game mine craft and shot like a like a reality tv show

00:25:25.18 like exactly like uh [Music]

00:25:28.09 survivor is and it's brilliant but we're

00:25:30.12 gonna shoot it next week it's not coming out until like September or October or

00:25:34.12 sometime so the hardest thing on earth is gonna be

00:25:38.02 you two are not gonna be able to talk about what happens at all in any

00:25:42.23 capacity so if you have beefs you're going to have to talk around them

00:25:46.09 because you can not spoil the integrity of that show two or three months before

00:25:50.23 it comes out no seems like a problem for whoever edits this podcast yes it does

00:25:56.19 um nick said uh oh oh well I mean no spoilers at this we're just talking

00:26:01.16 about things and I want to clarify my I genuinely I'm going into this

00:26:06.17 not expecting to even consider betraying

00:26:09.22 you Gavin but who knows what'll happen I understand if it goes the other way for

00:26:13.12 you too it's a game where you have to kind of

00:26:16.10 adjust there's a lot of other people who will be much better to betray

00:26:20.10 yeah for sure like that's what I'm saying I want to work with you in my

00:26:24.08 ideal world we're working together until a point in which one of us

00:26:29.03 probably will end up betraying the other but I would I I wouldn't be opposed to

00:26:33.07 working with you the entire way that's nice to hear yeah and I don't

00:26:37.21 your tone I don't feel like you believe me well I've gotta be wary of it

00:26:42.17 so you were so [ __ ]

00:26:46.02 no [ __ ] no the opposite of that yeah there are other people I I won't say

00:26:51.20 there are other people I'm much more worried about than Gavin I don't mean

00:26:56.10 that disrespectfully but this is you know let's take a let's take a poll of

00:27:00.11 people who are not gonna be in survive block island but that are present here

00:27:05.12 on this podcast uh that'll be Geoff nick and Eric uh Eric is uh Andrew gonna

00:27:11.03 [ __ ] Evan over uh yes I think I think again the way he just

00:27:15.09 gave himself a million outs when he was saying he wouldn't do it is so

00:27:20.08 just exactly on the nose for what you know is going to happen so yeah

00:27:23.22 yeah nick says uh you're already doomed 100 he will [ __ ] Gavin over that's my

00:27:29.09 problem I feel like nick said it better than I

00:27:32.11 could uh yeah but that's why I think gavin's going to betray me because I I

00:27:37.01 don't feel that way which is why you're going to betray him first hmm

00:27:40.14 that's typically not how this is your doubt is going to drive the knife

00:27:45.11 straight into my spine no and your paranoia you get pretty paranoid who does

00:27:50.10 you do I do you think I get paranoid definitely every time you see him you

00:27:54.20 were gonna [ __ ] light every bat on fire in your house when there was a

00:27:59.14 shipping error it's not an either or we can both be

00:28:02.22 very paranoid I'm 100 paranoid I understand paranoia that's how I know

00:28:07.09 you're paranoid that's fair and based off of my assessment of your paranoia I

00:28:12.23 will take your your grant you seem like a specialist

00:28:15.18 I will accept your diagnosis of paranoia it's a very paranoid game but I trust

00:28:20.09 I don't and I don't mean this rudely Gavin I don't think you're gonna play a

00:28:23.13 sneaky game because I just don't think that that's really who you are as a

00:28:26.13 person all right that's why I want to work with you but as a response it's

00:28:30.06 very it's a very keep your cards to your chest response I don't know how to read

00:28:34.04 that I'm glad you feel that way now that can we get some discussion about that

00:28:38.04 phrasing that that's not like that's that's

00:28:42.02 gavin's the hairs on the back of gavin's neck are standing straight up right now

00:28:45.13 I think he's already in self-defense mud I don't think

00:28:49.20 that's gonna be fun I'm I'm excited for that to happen

00:28:53.00 and it will be weird to not be able to talk about it for like two months.

00:28:58.17 I feel bad because I keep texting Geoff about it I keep I have all these

00:29:03.04 questions I feel like I'm annoying it's not annoying me at all I love it but

00:29:09.01 Andrew does put me to work he'll be like hey what if this impossible set of

00:29:14.09 uh sequence of events happened would I get in trouble and I have to go like

00:29:18.23 well I have to go research that now and have to go [ __ ] look it up is anybody

00:29:23.03 outside the game oh yeah come on every question is like yeah for sure it was

00:29:28.05 like like I'm not trying to break the rules but I would like to twist them

00:29:31.18 into a pretzel well [Laughter]

00:29:34.02 the the very first text I sent I was like I said to Geoff who I have questions

00:29:40.01 about certain things who would I ask uh if I have a rules question Geoff was kind

00:29:44.04 enough to be like ah you know I was involved feel free to ask me and I can

00:29:47.14 answer you answered in a way that was very clearly like you expecting to be

00:29:52.02 able to answer something kind of basic and I asked you an extremely specific

00:29:56.09 situation thing and your response was just [ __ ] I'll get back to you like you

00:30:01.07 then have to ask somebody yeah well I had to go I had to go have a

00:30:06.13 meeting about that question with two other people so we could

00:30:09.13 determine the answer.

00:30:12.19 [Applause]

00:30:15.09 Now a word from our sponsor better help being able to take care of your mental

00:30:20.07 health is so important there's all sorts of things you can do it really is

00:30:23.19 dependent on you I personally love to listen to music when I'm sorting through

00:30:28.06 things it kind of gives me a little bit of a disconnect

00:30:31.10 from what I'm going through while also making me very present it's just a

00:30:35.20 fantastic tool therapy is something that

00:30:37.23 has been very helpful for me there's all sorts of things you can do it's just

00:30:41.17 really coming up with those systems that work for for what you're going through

00:30:45.22 and what's best for you therapy is something that I've talked so much about

00:30:49.15 as having a tremendous impact on my life talking to someone and sorting through

00:30:54.04 things it just it has illuminated issues I had and helped inform

00:30:58.10 why I was struggling in certain ways that uh I didn't realize

00:31:02.15 if you're somebody who is maybe going through something I would always

00:31:07.00 recommend at least trying therapy and better help is an online therapy that

00:31:11.03 offers video phone and even live chat only therapy sessions so you don't have

00:31:15.00 to see anyone on camera if you don't want to it's much more affordable than

00:31:19.05 in-person therapy and you can be matched with a therapist in under 48 hours

00:31:24.04 our listeners get 10 off their first month at better help.com face

00:33:14.11 intending to post on the YouTube channel before the other two got posted

00:33:19.14 but someone found I think the very first ball that Geoff signed and they have it

00:33:24.08 and they've held their ball up to the screen and it's their exact same mark

00:33:28.13 giant monster hands yeah we sold that one to a giant apparently but uh yeah

00:33:33.00 yeah that is the ball yeah that's pretty wild

00:33:57.12 you want to spend the next half hour trying to schedule it I got time now now

00:34:00.19 it's not the last one it's a [ __ ]

00:34:02.13 podcast yeah we got another time I would

00:34:04.12 Eric but I wanted to uh I wanted to give you guys an update on my corn dogs okay

00:34:08.21 update I still haven't had a corndog what that's it yeah I remember I swore

00:34:12.23 off corn dogs forever everything while I give you guys an update and uh

00:34:18.06 they're still sworn off yeah I still haven't had one you st wait so

00:34:23.18 you yes I've said this multiple we had this conversation multiple times I said

00:34:27.15 I would have I remember dog again as long as I lived thank you Gavin and you

00:34:30.17 still haven't had one that's you still haven't had one just yeah just giving

00:34:34.00 you the update okay was there a moment in which you almost did no no not really

00:34:38.22 but I just realized I hadn't checked in with you guys in a while and I just

00:34:42.08 didn't want to leave you hanging uh Emily did buy some corndog frozen corn

00:34:45.12 dogs the other day but I was not in any way tempted by them did she have some

00:34:50.04 yeah she had some I think no they just threw them away

00:34:53.00 if they're in the freezer it doesn't mean they've had him yet that's true

00:34:58.04 but like are you really buying corn dogs for a later day

00:35:01.00 do you eat stuff like that you freeze the same week I feel like the freezer

00:35:05.03 absolutely long-term meal no if I'm buying something from the freezer

00:35:08.08 section that doesn't mean I'm gonna wait for it it's just how it's delivered I

00:35:12.10 got a red baron in mine that's probably been in there six weeks that's crazy I

00:35:16.06 bought two frozen pizzas they will be done that I will eat them within the

00:35:20.21 week easily nah I guess I'm like wasting the freezer

00:35:24.21 though I gotta go with gathered on this one the full point of the freezer is to

00:35:31.03 it's to preserve but I'm buying food that is frozen to reheat to eat now

00:35:35.16 I'm not I don't go into the I mean if you're getting it right now

00:35:40.10 why buy it frozen no because that's how it is now when you eat it that's always

00:35:44.09 the case no no no no no no no you listen stupid let me let me rephrase this

00:35:48.12 because I said it horribly I said it in a dumb way if I'm in the freezer section

00:35:53.22 in a grocery store I'm not looking in the pizza aisle going I'm gonna [ __ ]

00:35:57.21 enjoy this in June or December like I'm not gonna what do you mean I buy it

00:36:01.17 because I plan on eating it because I feel like a pizza and I'll have it

00:36:05.20 within the week typically yeah why would you buy me now why would you buy a

00:36:09.12 frozen one you could go buy like uh yeah fresh you could just

00:36:13.12 because it's the fresh one it's like a grocery store pizza and like they're

00:36:17.07 cheaper so like I I I use the flyer to buy my groceries typically they were on

00:36:21.17 sale two dollars a pizza I bought two of them so I'll have two frozen pizzas for

00:36:25.16 meals this week maybe it's just different how we buy

00:36:28.18 groceries I I typically will look at the flyer what a [ __ ] fascinating podcast

00:36:32.18 topic I look at the flyer once a week and I buy off the flyer typically for

00:36:36.04 how I get groceries and playing with that flyer from the grocery store I'll

00:36:39.11 go on their website and be like oh what's the weekly flyer then I will buy

00:36:43.07 off of the flyer to get discounted do they have a flyer that just tells you

00:36:46.15 what's on the end caps they don't tragically I'd love that be great

00:36:50.02 savings maybe you should start an independent newsletter that you can

00:36:53.16 distribute around your town that just explains what the deals on end caps are

00:36:58.15 week to week like a scouting report yeah kind of yeah

00:37:02.12 I mean as the guy who invented thank me later I'm surprised that that's how you

00:37:07.16 use your freezer like the freeze is the ultimate thank me later for food no

00:37:12.02 there are there are things for sure that you know are just there and they exist

00:37:17.16 for a very long time and that's fine so what's long term in your freezer

00:37:21.10 oh what's long term I don't uh probably like frozen fruit so how did it end up

00:37:26.05 there did you intend to eat it within a few days and then you just forgot or did

00:37:30.09 you buy it for later consumption it's always like I either forgot or I

00:37:34.05 just haven't gotten around to it so like

00:37:36.08 something that would last a long time or like if I buy a box of egg waffles or

00:37:39.10 something like that that will last a while I'm not going to go through that

00:37:43.01 whole box in a week but things that are like singular meal

00:37:46.23 items like a pizza those aren't those aren't lasting long

00:37:50.06 yeah I guess we just shop differently I buy frozen food and I like like I I'm

00:37:54.03 probably in like a week or two weeks or three weeks I'm gonna be [ __ ]

00:37:57.14 exhausted and not feel like cooking or ordering or yeah I'll just pop this in

00:38:01.01 mine's for when like in the future on an unknown date I'm

00:38:04.13 either gonna get back pretty late not have enough time to make anything or

00:38:08.02 something and it's just like an emergency meal for me that makes sense

00:38:12.05 it's a valid way to have it and ice cream you had any ice cream in your freezer

00:38:18.06 right now yeah I've got some uh dark why would

00:38:20.18 what's your favorite flavor of ice cream why was the ice cream part yeah that

00:38:25.09 broke you on this well I know I was just fascinated with how you used your

00:38:28.13 freezer but now we're just talking about what's in our freezers.

00:38:35.01 I was curious what ice cream you had uh I like the ones

00:38:38.17 yeah cookie dough is pretty good with chocolate chips cookie dough is good

00:38:43.01 it's all about texture for me do you have a brand choice probably ben ben and

00:38:47.09 jerry's ben and jerry's okay how about you I like ben and jerry's ben and

00:38:51.16 jerry's is good I don't really have a brand preference

00:38:54.04 as far as ice cream guess I will devour ice cream in a [ __ ] day ice cream is

00:38:59.01 not lasting long ice cream is not a long-term item in my

00:39:02.04 freezer really I can't I can't I cannot eat a lot at once I'm I'm I eat like an

00:39:06.10 inch of ice cream at a time cookie two-step Geoff just that's the [ __ ] right

00:39:11.01 there that's your favorite ice cream cookie two-step yeah when it's not full

00:39:15.02 of listeria they survive I think the cookie two-step was a thing

00:39:19.18 I learned at the same place I learned the sewing machine I think we would do

00:39:24.13 that after we'd start with this step and then we would do the icky

00:39:27.21 cookie two step

00:39:29.22 still a half gallon it says on the front I like that a lot the implication did

00:39:34.22 you hear I hear they may have gone below

00:39:37.04 the half gallon like they used to but no

00:39:39.18 let us clear the air still a half gallon or like all the other brands did and

00:39:43.17 they just refuse [Laughter]

00:39:47.09 I was like because you see that with fast food ads all the time like wendy's

00:39:51.23 whole thing is never frozen beef right like what are other companies doing that

00:39:57.01 how many other companies like it feels like a weird

00:39:59.09 just declaring you're doing doing a thing that doesn't necessarily I guess the

00:40:03.22 assumption is all the other companies do I know that monster munch

00:40:09.01 have I think on their packets have like old bit new old size what was it

00:40:14.17 new old size oh I remember this because they made them smaller right

00:40:20.12 they made it smaller they made them big again coming about they phrased it for

00:40:25.04 what what was the product monster mud the crisps

00:40:28.06 okay I didn't know what they were though

00:40:30.13 like I knew the name of I've never heard of a monster munch I'm gonna do some

00:40:34.12 go ogling there you go oh I have seen those

00:40:36.07 pickled onion flavors yeah let's pick pickle and then there's roast beef and

00:40:40.02 then there's flamin hot there should be a company that does what

00:40:43.12 dvd companies do with with things on the bag I will only eat chips that are

00:40:48.06 entertaining and fun it's my only it's my guideline for any snack

00:40:54.10 interactive menus didn't we talk about monster munch recently on this podcast

00:41:00.03 no I I think so yeah we talked about monster munch at large recently and I

00:41:05.07 think it was maybe when we were hanging out outside of work yeah so it says new

00:41:10.13 crossed out old and then it says bigger like they used to be what

00:41:15.14 on the top corner of that picture new oh slash old

00:41:19.16 new so they made them smaller and then everyone was like we hate it

00:41:24.13 so they made them bigger again oh so that was their ca I get you're saying

00:41:29.09 the campaign was we we did it we we got rid of a new

00:41:32.01 and that's the that's the multipack yeah

00:41:33.03 we're going to do a gauntlet of crisps I think when we yeah we're going to do

00:41:36.15 like some sort of a taste test or something is that not wrong does that

00:41:40.02 not ring a bell Andrew not at all to me with Emily with it with our our

00:41:45.02 significant others maybe maybe this was a I don't know oh maybe it was when we

00:41:48.19 were having lunch after jet skiing that would make sense maybe you're having

00:41:52.02 some chips doing a ranking of them it might have

00:41:54.13 been yeah and then I was going to send you both you and Andrew all of the

00:41:57.19 crisps and you were going to do the crisp gauntlet yeah I'd love to do that

00:42:02.04 yeah and then we were going to determine once and for all what the best flavors

00:42:06.17 were roast beef flamin hot I feel like roast beef probably

00:42:09.17 probably the best one of those ones I think pickled onions the best I think I

00:42:15.12 gotta say man I think the the munch sounds disgusting like every

00:42:20.02 flavor sounds like a flavor I wouldn't want but the packaging is adorable

00:42:25.06 you like the little monsters I love the monsters I love the purple color and the

00:42:29.08 green monster I like the font it all looks great I just I it loses me at

00:42:33.23 roast beef and pickled onion why aren't onions called pickles

00:42:38.08 huh that's pickled yeah but so so pickles are cucumbers yeah well

00:42:46.10 they're pickled cucumbers you know in america they are and

00:42:50.12 they're called other stuff other places like I think they call them gherkins

00:42:55.20 right Kevin yeah yeah okay but in america so a pickled so you have

00:42:59.12 a cucumber and you pickle it and now it's just a pickle but you can pickle

00:43:03.06 all sorts of things you could pickle onions that's true yeah I mean branston

00:43:06.19 pickles a bunch of pickle stuff what would you choose out of these three

00:43:11.18 flavors of knickknacks Andrew what you got [ __ ] you nice and spicy you got

00:43:15.11 scampi and lemon or ribbon saucy oh I like my knickknacks scampi

00:43:22.21 what are these are these chips they're knickknacks they're knickknacks okay

00:43:28.10 we got a this is a thing we need to pursue we haven't done a food thing in a

00:43:33.12 while on the show I'd love to do a deep dive on chips u.s has the worst

00:43:37.05 they stink your flavors are terrible us

00:43:39.12 no variety what the [ __ ] are you talking

00:43:43.09 about it's the worst you have such bland limited flavors in america

00:43:47.06 yes sorry we don't have shrimp scampi potato chips but it's because we have

00:43:52.23 some kind of [ __ ]

00:43:54.02 Jesus [ __ ] Christ we don't have roast beef flavored potato chips because we

00:43:58.04 make roast beef here that's a I mean like we don't need to make pickle we got

00:44:03.22 real flavors for real people that eat real food

00:44:07.03 yeah but you have salt and vinegar so I don't eat that [ __ ]

00:44:10.06 okay fair enough I just I whenever I'm in the us and I

00:44:13.19 look at the chip aisle it's always disappointing typically I agree the us

00:44:18.19 has like more of everything but the chip you guys are really lacking in the trip

00:44:23.12 department what about twiglets that's a great name that is a great name

00:44:27.19 I've never heard of a toilet dude you gotta love twiglets what else

00:44:31.18 does Jacob make other than twiglets crackers

00:44:35.11 I don't know what a cracker is in your country

00:44:38.13 shake yourself it's like is it like a pair of boots

00:44:43.07 oh this is [ __ ] stupid it is a dumb conversation but I'm genuinely we need

00:44:48.05 to do the chip thing I'm gonna get you both packages

00:44:51.12 how many bags of different flavors do you think we should do eight all of them

00:44:55.18 I should just try all the flavors right all of ten

00:44:58.15 I don't yeah I don't know how to answer and if we're gonna I mean I feel like we

00:45:01.18 should throw American chips in the way too oh what [ __ ] plain I think we're

00:45:06.00 good we're good oh we could you've obviously sir have never had

00:45:10.12 pizza flavored pringles wow spicy exotic all right spicy we'll just taste like

00:45:16.21 pizza let's prepare ten flavors from our land well I hope something like that

00:45:21.23 I don't know from barbecue flavors because that's all

00:45:25.22 we have uh Eric and nick do you want to try the uh wait what's that were you

00:45:30.10 talking about eating 30 chips

00:45:34.06 10 flavors each yeah well how many chips are in a bag

00:45:39.03 well no I'm not saying like that doesn't seem like a lot like you're all gonna

00:45:44.06 have to eat 30 different kinds of like you're not going to get like run out of

00:45:50.12 steam by like 12 and you have 18 more like you're having one chip I understand

00:45:56.01 I understand that but one chip 30 times is

00:46:00.08 with the different flavors where you're trying to like

00:46:05.12 drill down on them is like a lot that's like a considerable like considerable

00:46:11.11 Geoff am I wrong is 30.

00:46:12.22 I understand what he's saying but here's I think it's I think it's necessary and

00:46:17.12 I and I think that we with the way we need a palate cleanser we need to drink

00:46:21.18 some sprite or water or something in between yeah because I think this is

00:46:25.22 just swallowed a quaver and uh.

00:46:33.03 [Laughter]

00:46:39.01 It looks like old people toenails these names are so [ __ ] funny because

00:46:46.08 imagine having an argument as a kid going I like twiglets and another kid I

00:46:52.14 like quavers yeah I like cheesy what's it [Laughter]

00:47:05.16 yeah sure yeah we're in if it means I can have what sits in

00:47:10.02 flavors I can't wait here's what we gotta do

00:47:13.09 uh this needs to be supplemental this needs to be like the apple taste yes

00:47:19.01 it's too much for an episode of it all right I need to know are what sits

00:47:22.21 always baked or is there a non-baked version of a whatsapp

00:47:26.06 but the important thing is they're really cheesy they're really cheesy but

00:47:31.16 no Andrew is right though america has like doritos it has plain

00:47:35.11 lays and it has sun chips and that's what you get everywhere in every store

00:47:40.00 and there's no variation it's pretty bland it's pretty bland

00:47:44.10 you never get the crazy like right now our ladies is doing a uh

00:47:48.21 cheese and ketchup mashup is one of the top flavors

00:47:52.04 that they're rotating in they always do weird things I appreciate an odd chip

00:47:57.21 I also love this idea because I really need things for my 20000 item list and

00:48:02.21 this sounds like I got 30 right here look we got we got I'm looking at

00:48:07.21 doritos flavors right now oh we got we got spicy nacho we got flamin hot nachos

00:48:13.14 those are two different flavors I will say got

00:48:16.17 spicy sweet chili there you go three flavors right there that are all

00:48:20.10 essentially the same thing backyard barbecue

00:48:23.09 do you ever the crisps that you would make into a car and then eat what

00:48:28.13 they're like little transfer what this is

00:48:36.10 you get the middle piece and then you get little rings and you build it into a

00:48:42.10 small car and then you eat the whole lot back I take back everything I said

00:48:46.07 defending our chips.

00:48:53.00 [Music]

00:48:57.07 Yeah I think I think you've won all of us over with one [ __ ] image dude yeah

00:49:02.21 I don't want to eat doritos I want to eat a car yeah I

00:49:07.09 I feel like so the way to do this is we have to we'll secretly

00:49:11.18 create our collections and then maybe like we open the box and reveal what

00:49:15.13 everybody put in it I don't know how to logistically do this but I feel like

00:49:18.23 that's the funniest you've had several spoilers for what's going to be in my

00:49:22.09 package oh man transfer I would do that with bits and bytes myself but I never

00:49:26.18 had a brain like I would get the pretzel stick and I put all the little cheerios

00:49:30.20 to fill the stick with it and then I'd eat it once it was like a cheer uh

00:49:34.22 cheerio pretzel stick thing but I've never seen so transform a snack why

00:49:38.22 don't we do this in person why don't we make this the first in person thing I

00:49:42.06 mean that's so stuff so [ __ ] far from now but okay Andrew when does the ankle

00:49:46.06 bracelet come off uh I don't know I don't know the answer to that I'm not

00:49:51.11 you want me to travel to a different way when is the arrangement snack

00:49:56.15 yeah why does this we did an apple review not in person a thing I was much

00:50:01.14 more excited about where I couldn't eat them

00:50:04.12 and you want you want to do transforms why

00:50:08.12 this sounds really fun it does sound fun I can't argue that that's a great point

00:50:13.17 I want a question I have a question for you Andrew okay so given that Canada

00:50:18.17 is kind of a situated a country that's situated in it

00:50:22.10 kind of equally siphons off culture from the uk and america

00:50:26.12 do you have 10 Canadian potato chips yeah for sure well not necessarily are

00:50:32.01 can we include like cheesies and that type of thing as well what's cheesies

00:50:36.01 what's it like Hawkins like a Hawkins cheesy I don't know what that is oh yeah

00:50:40.03 it's a community that's one right there so that's

00:50:42.20 that's not see it's gonna come with nine more is that like me saying can I use

00:50:46.17 frazzles

00:50:49.12 crispy bacon.

00:50:53.20 [Music]

00:51:00.21 like nick's right it's like dog treats why are they all named like this this is

00:51:07.02 the craziest [ __ ] is there a way I can take a was it into frazzle and put

00:51:12.15 wheels on the transformer snack on it oh my god oh my god we can make the the

00:51:18.01 ultimate crisp wait it's like is Chester cheetah not a representative

00:51:23.00 of cheesies what's cheesies has nobody ever heard cheesies before no

00:51:28.06 dude Chester cheetahs [ __ ] cheetos no no you're kid no

00:51:34.15 I I think I toomz to myself did you mess up

00:51:39.09 I think I've tombst myself my entire life are you deep in the cove what I said

00:51:45.01 I said cheesies I was referencing a Chester cheetah product that you

00:51:50.04 certainly have the puffs and then the hard we have we have cheese

00:51:54.17 puffs and those are cheetos I know they're cheetos

00:51:58.04 the big ones are cheese puffs are Hawkins cheesies is that where I'm

00:52:02.17 did I I didn't invent cheesies and Hawkins cheesies gavin's over here like okay

00:52:08.02 what the [ __ ] is that that's not Hawkins cds exist okay so I

00:52:13.01 got that's the mix-up I'm gonna be like what yeah.

00:52:26.15 [Laughter]

00:52:30.13 I can't have that one oh that's funny it is bert's chips this is great I'm

00:52:35.23 excited for this so wait you said Hawkins cheesies but then you said

00:52:39.00 Chester cheetah and he's not on this thing these little they're packaged in

00:52:43.22 the 1930s what is this this it's like the top cheesy

00:52:48.12 what the [ __ ] are you saying how else would I describe those like

00:52:53.00 what type of snack is that is that a corn based this looks like a snack you

00:52:57.21 would get at the at the zoo in 1912. Nah they're delicious they're incredible

00:53:02.08 like it looks like something you'd get in a little league game in the 1980s

00:53:07.01 yeah yeah like you never wrote this under a big top

00:53:12.21 completely right but they are incredible

00:53:16.04 I just don't know what to call the snack what is a cheeto like what is the

00:53:21.05 general nerve like the general term cheeto yeah

00:53:24.21 yeah cheese puff a cheese puff so cheese but they have puffs they have a puff

00:53:29.12 variety you're getting too granular it's just cheese puff is the way to describe

00:53:33.12 it you're getting too granular you're let's stop you before you go further

00:53:38.15 what's the best that's it doritos flavor I'm not a doritos guy what

00:53:44.10 I'm not a doritos guy what's regular the the regular like nacho like default

00:53:47.21 nacho nacho cheese yeah yeah I think I I really do think that's the best dorito

00:53:52.12 flavor I think everything else is fine you don't like cool original well but in

00:53:58.06 america we call that cool ranch yeah I guess ranch I guess ranch isn't a flavor

00:54:03.22 in england so they just call it original

00:54:06.18 original that's me I'm a dude original I wonder if

00:54:11.22 I wonder if cool original doritos tastes exactly like cool ranch street is or if

00:54:17.00 there is some sort of difference that's what I bet they are the exact same but

00:54:20.17 that's worth testing yeah it is why do I bring that from my land and you bring

00:54:24.13 cool ranch from your land okay I'll bring up from my land which

00:54:28.06 you also live in yeah I'll grab it from the grocery store that we both go to

00:54:34.15 no I no I'm happy to do the work I just thought it was interesting the way you

00:54:39.20 phrased it as if we don't live three miles away from each other that's true

00:54:44.18 nick posted his zaps earlier that is a respectable us chip the voodoo flavors

00:54:49.04 are [ __ ] great zaps are pretty good I'll give zap some credit but we need to

00:54:53.09 do this you don't have miss vicki's no we do but it's just they're fine they're

00:54:57.17 bland it's the same type of trip [ __ ] jalapeño chips are amazing yeah

00:55:02.07 they're pretty good jalapeño very residue though really gotta wash your

00:55:06.17 hands after them yeah that's true that's fair we should wrap up oh

00:55:11.05 LeBron James flamin hot cheddar and sour

00:55:13.05 cream we have a whole evergreen division of snacks here that are like sports

00:55:18.06 people snacks but that's aliens that's a pretty good one Gavin yeah

00:55:23.03 what the [ __ ] the [ __ ]

00:55:24.23 Go to flavor notice says flamin hot cheddar and sour

00:55:28.14 cream by LeBron James what creative input do you think he had this well

00:55:32.19 according to the commercial because I've seen it a thousand times during the

00:55:36.16 playoffs he ate a flaming hot ruffle and

00:55:39.12 he went this delicious and then he ate a cheddar and sour cream uh ruffle and he

00:55:44.02 thought this is also delicious and then he had like a light bulb over his head

00:55:47.04 and he put them both in his mouth at the same time and ate it and then he said

00:55:50.12 I'm a genius and then I think he became the creative director I regret asking

00:55:56.06 I'm pretty sure that's how that works this is a weird episode but I enjoyed it

00:56:01.04 I had a good time that was strange this is a strange one I'm just looking at

00:56:06.04 crisps I'm just so excited to make this package this is the second perspective

00:56:11.09 the second episode is always weird man it depends it's true

00:56:15.00 it's always something sometimes it's sometimes it's amazing sometimes it's a

00:56:18.08 home run but it's never a home run in the way you think it'll be

00:56:22.10 oh man I did you so Gavin because now you wrap up

00:56:28.08 did you get to like the eight things that you wanted to talk about

00:56:32.23 I mean we got through a few of them I mean what are you talking about we got

00:56:38.06 through a few of them what we spent 25 minutes on chips and

00:56:42.11 you had notes to use uh Geoff did you go through all your notes

00:56:47.09 no not at all I was looking through here this is insane I I've got look my notes

00:56:52.16 guy found his baseball I've got uh socks I got tea towel

00:56:57.05 we don't need to recap all the things we've talked about in the last few

00:57:00.23 things this is curious why are you asking well because I was out of notes

00:57:04.20 and I assume we went 20 minutes on chips because we were note less at this point

00:57:08.03 no I think we were just really into no I guess I got really good she's halfway

00:57:11.12 there but I got some I didn't get to mainly because I don't understand them

00:57:16.15 uh tuna fish can spill in the sea what does that mean

00:57:20.06 tuna fish can spit in the sea spill spill tuna fish that's a bill in the c

00:57:26.15 yeah I don't know what that is but that was you should here you when you write

00:57:30.12 down a note you should write the date next to it so you can at least narrow it

00:57:34.21 down to what you're doing in the world I had uh

00:57:37.05 uh this is a good one after our after the the pool party for my birthday we

00:57:40.22 had and we had so much fun with the rings and stuff and we'll cover this

00:57:44.21 later but I I was thinking I think the time is right

00:57:48.08 for us to invent the new like the new hot pool game like Marco polo's old it's

00:57:54.10 tired I think I think that but and I was thinking we could combine

00:57:58.08 it with swans I don't know what this is but I wrote

00:58:01.06 down swan king of the hill so like maybe there's something there

00:58:04.20 or we could investigate something else so that's something we can talk about
