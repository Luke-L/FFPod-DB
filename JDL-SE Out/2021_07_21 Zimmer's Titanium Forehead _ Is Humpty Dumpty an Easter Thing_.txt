00:00:34.15 hello and welcome to another episode of the

00:00:38.04 F**kFuckFacePodcast I believe it is uh the 60th iteration of this show

00:00:43.03 uh with me as always Andrew and Gavin and

00:00:46.10 uh I think nick is out this episode but Eric is hiding somewhere in the

00:00:50.12 background been about four minutes since we last

00:00:54.04 spoke how's everybody doing that have you been

00:00:56.06 I missed you guys missed you too I went to talk to you Geoff I didn't know you

00:01:00.03 left about the celtics coach there's no nothing I heard nothing I

00:01:03.21 like the guy I'm in I I was unsure at first yeah I'm a big fan Andrew do you

00:01:07.20 struggle when people are talking to you but you're doing something else do you

00:01:11.05 just block block out the rest of the world because I feel like he was very

00:01:14.14 loudly like I'm gonna go pee I heard you only and then as I thought

00:01:18.21 it was just you yeah I don't know I guess so maybe if I did would I know

00:01:23.14 I don't think I would know I think someone would else have to for me listen

00:01:27.10 I'll be honest I'm well aware of who I am and how I come across

00:01:31.05 I'm pretty easy to ignore I've had 46

00:01:33.07 years of it I get it I'm used to it it's kind of like by the

00:01:36.23 way let me just say I mentioned to you guys like two or

00:01:40.11 three episodes ago now that I came to peace with my space my

00:01:43.13 my station in the universe which is like I am of the level of dog [ __ ] and as

00:01:47.16 long as I don't try to go above that then things are

00:01:50.13 fine and I just want you guys to know uh it's been going great like once I

00:01:54.15 still uh universe and I uh where we're still seeing eye to eye been no major

00:01:58.23 tragedies the house hasn't fallen apart you know we did a little bit of rain

00:02:01.21 because Gavin and I hung out but but I've been uh I've been reminding

00:02:05.08 myself when I see [ __ ] I'm no better than [ __ ] and then I pick it up

00:02:09.01 immediately and I deal with the [ __ ]

00:02:11.05 and uh and it's it's been great it's been fine that's uh

00:02:14.12 really learn to settle with where I am and not

00:02:17.20 not try to be oh you know better should we have a

00:02:20.00 I'm no better than [ __ ] t-shirt I know better than [ __ ]

00:02:22.23 What would be the design on it the design I assume would just be text

00:02:26.06 you don't think um I feel like there has to be a design wait what's Eric saying

00:02:30.03 said the same before everything fell apart last time I feel like this is the

00:02:33.06 stuff I said after everything fell apart and I had the realization

00:02:38.04 no no this was one thing happened with your car

00:02:41.02 and then everything happened after that the car happened and then you went you

00:02:46.08 know what I'm just gonna take it as it comes and

00:02:50.02 then the next month of episodes and then it came

00:02:53.11 yeah I did a whole game so something to consider

00:02:56.13 I I don't know man I've got a new shitty lease on life

00:02:59.14 so when Eric said this is the same stuff you said before everything fell apart

00:03:02.19 last time I thought he meant vin diesel yeah I thought the same thing I was like

00:03:06.06 is the episode going downhill yeah so I thought it was a big diesel

00:03:09.14 reference and then that made me think holy [ __ ] gavin's right I don't remember

00:03:13.07 any of this conversation said last episode I guess I wasn't

00:03:16.08 listening I was pretty sure this is all new

00:03:19.12 but you meant the car Geoff's life fell apart not the episode

00:03:24.10 less important understood you know who else

00:03:27.09 who I I didn't know this I so I made the the zimmer

00:03:30.06 the dinner zimmer salad last episode not to be confused with the regulation

00:03:33.12 zimmer salad or the regulation solid yeah no

00:03:36.23 yeah so I was doing a lot of research about

00:03:39.22 don zimmer and I didn't know I didn't did you know that he

00:03:43.07 almost died when he was like in his 20

00:03:45.11 for from a baseball I had no idea yeah like cracked his skull right he was

00:03:48.15 in a coma for two weeks whoa yeah no yeah he was he was unconscious for 13 days

00:03:54.06 and his weight plummeted from 170 to 124

00:03:56.11 and they told him he'd never play again when he was 22. Oh my god I took like a

00:04:00.00 fastball to the face they had to drill holes into

00:04:04.01 his skull to relieve the pressure so that he could survive he had fluid

00:04:08.06 yeah I guess he had fluid this then created there was a rumor for

00:04:11.18 a while that he had a titanium plate put into his head and I feel like those

00:04:15.19 rumors were fully from when he had his fight

00:04:18.17 because he went head first I feel like the logic was that

00:04:21.12 he was trying to use his titanium yeah that like he was trying to utilize the

00:04:25.11 weapon that he was given using the titanium forehead uh it was not

00:04:29.12 he does not have a titanium forehead they did put like some screws or like

00:04:33.05 buttons or something in there I bet he believed he had a titanium head

00:04:37.11 although immediately disarmed when your head just gets pushed into the ground

00:04:41.12 my favorite part of when I was doing research the thing I was reading they

00:04:44.12 wrote out like he was hit he's fully unconscious for 13 days like he nearly

00:04:48.04 died and then they followed up with he was beaned again in 1956.

00:04:53.01 Only getting hit in the head with a baseball bean is hilarious

00:04:57.12 to me I love beanings it's a great word it must be such

00:05:00.23 a jarring feeling though to be playing baseball get hit in the head and then

00:05:04.15 it's two weeks later like what must that feel like oh my god

00:05:07.14 I don't I wouldn't have felt the ball I don't imagine it's immediately out

00:05:11.18 is that a strikeout how does that count or does he go to base

00:05:15.05 yeah that's that's that's just that's all based on ball right yeah they'll

00:05:18.14 probably have to put in a pinch runner for you while they

00:05:21.02 carry off in a stretcher it's an hpp it's hit by pitch okay

00:05:25.07 we should run an experiment we could hit Gavin in the head

00:05:27.23 with a fastball oh and then uh two weeks later we'll ask him what he

00:05:31.16 remembers don't they wear helmets though playing

00:05:34.12 basically they do was that so far in the past that the helmets hadn't been

00:05:37.12 invented I'd well I'm sure helmets were invented

00:05:40.16 by that point I don't know if they used them

00:05:42.19 that's another question entirely but helmets certainly existed

00:05:46.06 I can't believe like when you look back on the way stuff evolved technology-wise

00:05:50.12 I can't believe seat belts weren't a thing for so long.

00:05:55.11 I think [ __ ] dude surely the first car crash killed the driver

00:06:00.02 surely I remember when gus and I were into

00:06:03.16 we had we both had old cars for a while this is early rt and before rt

00:06:08.23 and I remember like one of gus's trucks I think didn't have seat belts

00:06:13.19 and it wasn't required to because like they didn't have to

00:06:17.01 he wasn't legally required to have them because they weren't required at the

00:06:20.05 time that the truck was built or something and so they just didn't

00:06:24.15 exist and so it was okay but it was like I think I'm getting that

00:06:28.21 right but it was like a 63 or a 64

00:06:31.05 truck so it wasn't that old oh I'm sure at the time

00:06:33.12 maybe the way the cars were built in general maybe seat belts

00:06:36.15 would have been a death sentence when they're attached to the way that they

00:06:39.17 used to be built like they would have just ripped you in half

00:06:42.10 well also [ __ ] like car seats like my mom I don't think I had a car seat when

00:06:45.18 I was a kid because I was born in the 70s right and my mom

00:06:47.07 was like the car seat was the [ __ ]

00:06:49.16 floorboard they just throw you on the floorboard

00:06:52.04 with a pillow and some blankets like and you just don't hit [ __ ] you know

00:06:57.12 you know when there's like something on the floor of a car and you break hard

00:07:03.16 and then like [Laughter]

00:07:11.20 oh Geoffrey what are you doing under here get back there.

00:07:19.16 I was wildly wrong I did not think you're going to go with seat belts I

00:07:24.05 thought you were going to stay within the realm of sports with like hockey how

00:07:27.10 goalies didn't wear masks for a long time like I was all prepared for that it

00:07:31.01 was a much more impactful choice oh no I was just

00:07:34.19 thinking like safety in general was just like

00:07:36.16 so secondary now stuff's built around safety

00:07:39.14 speaking of not wearing helmets and masks I'll tell you who should is

00:07:43.01 [ __ ] Devon booker I have watched gav this is he's a basketball player

00:07:46.18 it's the playoffs right now he got hit in the first game of the series or maybe

00:07:51.18 second game and he had his nose broken in three places

00:07:54.11 so then he started wearing like a face shield

00:07:57.06 but it's hard to shoot with it on or whatever it's uncomfortable so he keeps

00:08:00.06 taking it off and I swear to god every time he takes

00:08:03.00 that shield off and walks on the court somebody punches him as hard as they can

00:08:06.21 straighten his [ __ ] nose happened last night again he was on the

00:08:11.00 ground covered he covered his face with his shirt to cry he was in so much

00:08:15.03 pain and it's like dude put the [ __ ] mask back on yeah I

00:08:17.20 mean that's something that I guess when your nose is broken in three places even

00:08:21.07 with the mask it's gonna hurt I can't imagine

00:08:24.06 without it I don't even realize the nose is

00:08:26.09 a nose bone is big enough to break in three places can't break mine

00:08:30.11 I have an unbreakable nose we've covered this that's true

00:08:34.01 I don't need the mask I'll never need it I think if I was a bad

00:08:37.05 shooter though I'd wear a mask season like every every season I just come up

00:08:41.03 with like ah I broke I guess I'd have to come up with a

00:08:43.14 different excuse how many times have you been hit in the nose punch like punched

00:08:47.20 or like what do you mean or just taking a blow to the nose uh well I don't uh

00:08:52.05 it just bounces right off so I couldn't tell you the number it doesn't really

00:08:55.08 matter I've never like sustained a batting

00:08:57.20 I'm saying like anything that impacts the nose it does no damage it just keeps

00:09:01.16 on moving anything that impacts the noise

00:09:05.05 yeah I how are you serious dude I hit my [ __ ] nose so hard

00:09:10.06 an hour and a half ago I almost blacked out I I don't know what I have like the

00:09:15.16 Anderson silva of noses like it just bobs and

00:09:19.05 like you can't like when it hits it's not like direct I don't know providing

00:09:22.16 any information about your impacts to those you're just it's like saying oh

00:09:25.18 this this uh pint glass unstoppable I'm saying that like when things

00:09:30.06 when things hit the nose it like somehow deflects it and it does minimal damage

00:09:36.00 like I don't there's nothing I couldn't tell you at times I know I've

00:09:38.08 been hitting the nose by thing it just means you haven't been hit very hard in

00:09:41.22 the nose no I definitely ha I'm telling my no when we

00:09:45.23 like but like the pint glass in my cupboard has never broken

00:09:50.00 does not mean if I throw at the wall it's going to stay in one piece

00:09:55.08 yeah dude I can come to Austin I got a watering can here

00:09:59.08 hit that hit yourself in the nose with that uh and I guarantee you you'll feel

00:10:02.23 it you'll feel your nose go back into your

00:10:05.19 brain did you fall into your water again dude earlier I was is that why you were

00:10:10.06 late arrow well it's not but uh arrow was out in the backyard and she peed

00:10:15.18 like on the on the patio like on the concrete and uh not in the

00:10:20.18 grass and so I spray it off otherwise it the sun bakes it into hot dry piss

00:10:25.09 smell which is [ __ ] unbearable so anytime she does it I go grab the

00:10:29.02 hose and I spray it off you know and so I went to the hose I grabbed the

00:10:32.12 hose and I bit down to turn it on and I guess right next to it was a

00:10:35.21 little like a little bench and it had a watering can on it and I

00:10:40.02 [ __ ] didn't see it and I hit that watering can like the

00:10:43.18 spout at the bottom of my nose as hard as I could bending down

00:10:47.08 and then to add insult to injury so like it shoves my nose up into my brain a

00:10:52.00 little bit so I can I don't remember some things

00:10:54.02 I'm pretty sure but uh I definitely lost some knowledge in that but then

00:10:57.12 to add insult to injury because it's a watering cannon I hit the spout

00:11:01.09 uh the force pushed it down so that the handle of the watering can the watering

00:11:04.13 can tipped and then the wat the top of the watering can hit me in the back of

00:11:08.06 the head at the same time so I like double whapped myself

00:11:12.19 how's the nose doing that's it hurt but it's fine now

00:11:16.13 I'm not gonna be fine the entire time no

00:11:19.12 worries I would love to see I would love to see you dude

00:11:22.14 next time I'm in person you can feel my nose you're gonna feel the dexterity of

00:11:26.21 it the the movement it's very bendable I've got a great damage resistant nose

00:11:31.03 you know what you guys keep talking I'm gonna do something I'll be right back

00:11:34.17 you guys uh continue with me okay what do you think Geoff's gonna go do Gavin

00:11:39.03 maybe he's gonna get the watering can maybe he's gonna get a soda and actually

00:11:42.17 do it for the first time and finally actually chug a soda

00:11:46.12 I just feel like there's a lot of bones that you haven't broken but for some

00:11:50.21 reason you dwell on the nose as being the one that's indestructible

00:11:54.03 well because like you haven't felt my nose if you feel my nose you'd be like

00:11:57.14 this is I don't know anyone's nose well I'm telling you mine is

00:12:02.02 mine is very flexible what am I gonna get out of like shoving my thumb against

00:12:06.15 your nose though it's just gonna feel like a

00:12:09.00 what do you mean no the flexibility of it the the lack of damage I feel like

00:12:12.23 it's kind of shelled in a way that would make it very difficult to break in any

00:12:16.17 angle it's a very durable nose I everything else would fall apart around it

00:12:21.19 I'm not saying I'm invulnerable as I said before if I got hit by a missile

00:12:26.04 it would hold but everything else would go away

00:12:29.03 do I think Eric just asked do we think Geoff's coming back I do think Geoff's

00:12:32.04 coming back yeah yeah he's coming back I don't know what he's doing though

00:12:35.22 is he getting the watering can do you think he's gonna hit himself there's no

00:12:38.04 way he's gonna hit himself the water can I think I'm really gonna have to

00:12:40.23 talk him into doing this bike stunt you know like the way he was talking about

00:12:44.00 it I kind of got the impression he he was

00:12:46.12 saying like it wasn't gonna be worth it it wasn't gonna be worth the effort

00:12:50.04 it's not gonna be very good and I in my head that's what makes it better like if

00:12:53.11 we go to all that effort and then he gets like two inches of air yeah

00:12:58.05 the least impressive it is the funnier it is that's what I was saying

00:13:01.16 yeah you want it to be bottom of the barrel like barely like he gets a little

00:13:05.09 bit of air in a phantom camera in the slo-mo but

00:13:09.11 you were getting so excited as well just by thinking that we might be doing it

00:13:13.12 I've really been pushing to get it done it just feels like something two

00:13:16.17 seven-year-olds would do you haven't been pushing that hard dude

00:13:18.17 I've been tech because you were trying to talk you were trying to talk us out

00:13:22.06 of it and I was like look it's gonna be good either way

00:13:24.12 what did you go do Geoff welcome back I I felt like I didn't do a good job of

00:13:28.00 illustrating what was going on with the watering can so I took a

00:13:32.08 picture to show you how I how I hit myself twice oh it's

00:13:36.12 like really narrow in the end it looks like it could have cut you

00:13:39.22 really badly it hurts so that's what I did

00:13:42.15 and so when I hit it then my nose hit the spout yeah knock the other part up

00:13:47.12 into my brain it's like an extreme neti pot yeah yeah but see if you look

00:13:52.01 look at Geoff's nose that's a very breakable looking nose to me yours as

00:13:55.10 well Gavin it's kind of there's like a large area for where it could break

00:13:59.05 what you're trying to say it's extended I'm saying it's not like I have a

00:14:02.12 flatter smaller nose there's just not a lot of room for it to

00:14:05.21 move did the top of the watery can also hit you in the forehead from the angle

00:14:09.18 or is it just uh yeah no that's what I was trying to

00:14:12.09 illustrate to you guys is that when I hit it with my nose

00:14:14.17 it kicked the rest of it in and then it hit me in the forehead in the top of the

00:14:18.13 head so technically I guess I get hit in three spots by one watering can

00:14:23.18 I just don't know how you don't see that yeah

00:14:28.00 well like you said Gavin you bend down with your eyes closed the watering can

00:14:33.01 that the spout is thin and long and black and I was bending down into grass

00:14:36.19 it just didn't just didn't stick out to me

00:14:39.20 you've got to put up a security camera or something so we can watch

00:14:45.09 realize this was going to be content but

00:14:48.00 yeah I I didn't even think to mention it until Andrew started talking about his

00:14:53.11 unbreakable nose you got assaulted by your watering can

00:14:56.02 how is that not content it's amazing it didn't rise

00:14:59.04 to it didn't it didn't stand out to me until you mentioned your unbreakable

00:15:02.08 nose why do you even have a watering can like that if you have a hose uh to

00:15:07.20 water uh potted plants and stuff yeah but why can't the hose do that

00:15:10.23 inside oh I mean that's an outdoor can though an indoor watering cat is much

00:15:15.09 smaller and less muddy than that yeah but the hose

00:15:18.02 doesn't travel across the entire yard so like if I want to water the rose bushes

00:15:21.20 over on millie's side of the house I use a watering can

00:15:24.15 or sometimes I'll fill up the watering can outside with the hose

00:15:28.01 because it's way faster than using the kitchen sink and then I can go around

00:15:31.05 and water the plants inside the house with it

00:15:33.12 all right yeah fair enough but you don't want to have a giant ass

00:15:36.09 black watering can hanging out in your living room so you put it outside

00:15:39.23 I still I'm trying to wrap my head around the fact that a watering can

00:15:44.13 threw a combo at Geoff and he didn't feel this content

00:15:48.17 just didn't yeah maybe maybe it knocked that part of my brain away I don't know

00:15:54.02 here's here's the deal Andrew and I think Gavin can corroborate this

00:15:57.13 uh that kind of [ __ ] happens so often throughout the course of every day of my

00:16:01.19 life that it just it's just it's second nature to me I don't think

00:16:05.07 about it unless I have a Gavin behind me laughing at me and pointing out how

00:16:08.07 ridiculous the situation is because that's like that's like every 18 minutes

00:16:11.11 of my life it's true it's like there's a is a non-magnetic

00:16:15.21 magnet in your head that just pulls stuff towards it like

00:16:19.18 you whack your head on stuff like no one else and not on metal things all the

00:16:22.21 time yeah it's just something about your skull that the universe likes

00:16:28.12 what was your let was your last injury Andrew have you had a have you bashed

00:16:32.21 your head on anything no have I bat no not a lot of head bashings I broke

00:16:37.14 my toe a while ago and were when I moved like a year ago I guess that was

00:16:40.18 probably the last one broke one of my toes just opened the

00:16:44.15 door into it bent back how's that toe doing it's fine yeah 100

00:16:48.19 back to yeah I'd say 100 yeah I'd say it's a standard toe ankles are good

00:16:53.12 uh ankles are unquestionable at times I did

00:16:56.20 oh should I talk about this should I try um

00:16:59.16 we don't know until you talk about it Gavin knows what it is should I talk

00:17:03.12 about this Gavin I texted Gavin about this before I did a thing

00:17:07.04 I one of the grossest things of my life happened to me

00:17:10.12 I don't remember what we're talking about I it involved uh

00:17:13.21 I hurt my achilles I guess I'm just gonna tell the story this is the grossest

00:17:19.01 thing that has ever happened to me is disgusting

00:17:21.15 it's unfortunate I hurt my achilles and the day

00:17:25.00 the day I heard it was like bad but then

00:17:26.17 it like kept getting worse but the day I heard I had to go do something

00:17:32.02 uh so I brushed my teeth at my desk I got my bathroom next to me

00:17:35.07 and uh then I went about my day and then I hurt my like my achilles was really

00:17:39.07 bad I had to lay down so I was just kind of in bed for most of the time for like

00:17:42.15 the next three days so it happened like Tuesday finally kind

00:17:46.23 of feeling like a mobile on Friday things are good uh this was

00:17:50.20 during while I was building my sauce empire which is an important detail of

00:17:55.03 the story so I get more sauce I get my meal

00:17:57.04 get the nuggets get my drink I take a big sip of my drink and I drank my

00:18:01.22 toothpaste from Tuesday on Friday oh yeah I spit because I I was at my

00:18:08.10 desk when I brushed my teeth so I just spit it into a mcdonald's cup I had on

00:18:13.01 my desk and then I spent the next three days I

00:18:16.00 spent the next three days immobilized so I didn't clean my desk at all and it

00:18:21.12 was in the same cup as is the same looking cup as the new

00:18:25.11 one I got with the nuggets and I mistook them and I just was like

00:18:29.19 ah there's a little bit left final sip and it was the the spit that was the the

00:18:35.15 it was it was bad it was disgusting where was the toothbrush during all this

00:18:40.23 I guess the toothbrush would have been on my desk so you

00:18:44.21 you're the kind of person that when you stop doing something you just put it

00:18:49.09 down right there and that's where it lives until

00:18:52.19 forever you didn't take the toothbrush back to the bathroom

00:18:57.09 no I was listen I my my I was in it's tough to walk so I sat down put

00:19:01.05 it on my desk typically I'd always like I don't brush my teeth at my desk

00:19:04.10 generally typically we do that in the bathroom in front of the sink I feel like

00:19:07.23 brushing teeth without running water though that's

00:19:10.07 like what was what's was the state of your mouth after you scarsed it into a

00:19:14.05 cup surely you've still got like you need to rinse nah no that was not a

00:19:17.20 good one I always rinse that was a no rinse I'm saying it was a bad moment

00:19:21.06 I'm not proud of this this was an unfortunate moment

00:19:24.07 what did it taste like because surely it just tasted like mint in you

00:19:28.12 well so there was a little bit of root beer still in that cup so imagine

00:19:33.00 like oh it gets grosser there is like a little bit of root beer

00:19:37.23 when I spit into it so it tasted like old root beer and then immediately that

00:19:42.16 mintiness of toothpaste and it but I I took like a hard sip

00:19:46.13 because it was just a little bit less I was like I need to just you know like

00:19:50.01 really suck on this one and then I swallowed it by the

00:19:54.04 before I even tasted anything then I had the taste

00:19:57.16 I swallowed it it was disgusting it's the most

00:19:59.15 disgusting sound well I didn't taste it consistency must have been all wrong

00:20:04.01 it was instant Gavin like it was a huge it was just like

00:20:07.14 damn there was no it didn't it spent no time in my mouth it was like looping

00:20:11.23 down your gullet yeah it just it was because it was the same exact [ __ ]

00:20:16.10 cup and I just put them in the wrong places it was tragic it's disgusting just

00:20:20.21 imagining you a white a wine tasting they're like oh how does the mouth feel

00:20:24.19 and you're like the what [Laughter]

00:20:27.14 I think the grossest thing that's ever happened to me I felt sick I felt like I

00:20:32.00 had contracted a virus as soon as it happened I didn't know

00:20:34.20 what to do it was like that just I can't reverse I think I would have thrown up

00:20:37.22 did you did you have any little any push back

00:20:40.22 from the I think my soul left my body like I I was no longer a person after it

00:20:45.19 happened and I processed what I had just been through you had an out-of-body

00:20:48.19 experience you like floated out you looked back

00:20:52.00 down at yourself and just thought I'm disgusting

00:20:55.18 it was just yeah it was like it was an unintentional

00:20:58.09 gross it was just unfortunate it's an unfortunate accident

00:21:02.13 if it helps buddy I've been there it's disgusting and terrible

00:21:05.13 uh and it'll haunt you for years but you will get

00:21:08.11 oh I'm never getting over this it's I I haven't had root beer since

00:21:11.22 I will never have root beer that it could kill a root beer for you I I it

00:21:15.03 killed I did something similar killed Pepsi for

00:21:17.16 me for a long long time where uh when I was in Kuwait

00:21:20.22 one of the times uh in the army uh my boss used to dip

00:21:23.20 all the time and everybody's got a story about how they accidentally drank dip

00:21:27.07 but I I [ __ ] did as well uh and he used to spit it into this

00:21:30.13 Pepsi can and I picked up a Pepsi can that was three quarters full because my

00:21:34.06 Pepsi camera was three quarters full and it was in the desert in Kuwait so I

00:21:37.21 didn't expect it to be cold because there wasn't a lot of air

00:21:41.07 conditioning so it wasn't cold so it didn't strike me as odd

00:21:45.05 and then I chugged the entire three-quarter bottle

00:21:47.16 and then everything went wrong all at once and I had like a moment of levity

00:21:51.03 where I I took the Pepsi can down and I looked

00:21:53.23 at it and I thought my brain figured out what it was

00:21:55.22 and I just kind of looked at it for a second and then and then full

00:21:59.01 realization came and I just turned to the right and I

00:22:02.21 projectile vomited across the office oh people got just stopped drinking

00:22:08.19 the dregs of stuff yeah and what's with all the spit

00:22:12.04 like I I won't spit anywhere unless it's gonna slip down the pipe with water

00:22:16.21 like what gauzing into a candle and into cups that disgusts me alone it's those

00:22:21.08 tobacco chewers man that's what they do the candle was an exception I needed

00:22:25.12 there was nothing else I didn't opt for the candle that wasn't

00:22:29.07 my place of choice of a bottle though yeah but the bottle

00:22:32.12 still had liquid in it I didn't spit in that that's where the liquid

00:22:35.14 came from why the candle you did I've been over this before Gavin I'm a

00:22:39.09 [ __ ] violent vomiter it is aggressive there's no way I'm

00:22:42.22 getting that all in the bottle it's shooting everywhere I just needed

00:22:45.22 something I could put my mouth over you can't

00:22:48.06 you can't like spit through pursed lips there's no

00:22:51.00 no I was everything was coming up at that time I couldn't I had to go

00:22:55.22 into the candle there's nothing else I had at my desk

00:22:59.00 I'd go into my hand before I went into a candle a candle's

00:23:02.07 way better than a hand is it the same candle that you burn the waffle

00:23:06.07 uh my air freshener is it's a different it's a different

00:23:09.22 candle than the the waffle does the condo still function

00:23:12.16 oh no that candle is is the the waffle one or the spit one the spit one I'm

00:23:16.12 sure is fine I haven't used it but I'm sure it's fine

00:23:19.00 but the waffle one why do you have so many candles in your bedroom I'm a

00:23:22.06 candle guy I like that he did say that he's a candle guy

00:23:25.22 I like to keep the fire going I just feel like it's bad for a bedroom

00:23:30.15 unless you're trying to do like a romantic gesture

00:23:33.23 ah it smells nice I'm not allowed to have a nice nice but

00:23:38.15 maybe he's romancing the casio you never know

00:23:41.16 a bedroom is just way more flammable I feel like than a normal room

00:23:44.15 I got a fire extinguisher

00:23:46.19 he's got a bat he's got a trash bag full of extinguished fire extinguishers

00:23:54.08 fire suppressants in a black bin bag just sprinkle some of the bag on whatever

00:23:59.16 this opens the bag and kicks all over the room

00:24:03.16 I've got another fire extinguisher but I have the ingredients of a fire

00:24:07.14 extinguisher that would be interesting to see if just

00:24:11.22 the powder in a bag would actually do the job could we put out a file with it

00:24:16.20 what a weird what a weird yeah something's on fire

00:24:20.08 shoot it on the bag and then pat out the fire with the bang it's

00:24:25.22 an unnecessary step hey by the way what was it like to burn that

00:24:29.04 uh that waffle air freshener so that's the thing so as as talked about before I

00:24:33.17 have a smoke alarm right above my desk which went off when I tried to cook desk

00:24:37.03 dogs I was very worried about the logistics

00:24:40.06 of the thing that's why I left because I lit it

00:24:43.09 and it just went up in smoke immediately I

00:24:46.08 then sprinted to the patio and it went out briefly because it fell into the wax

00:24:50.08 and then I had to re-light it there's a whole process it smelled

00:24:54.10 terrible it was not good it wasn't as bad as the freshener itself

00:24:58.19 maybe the worst but it was it's a bad smell we had a funny moment

00:25:03.15 uh where I at this point it was like six

00:25:05.19 months ago we did that second break show I can't I don't even know where this

00:25:08.20 where we are in the timeline right now but in it we we had some fun [ __ ]

00:25:12.18 around with the air freshener and like sticking it

00:25:15.07 under each other's chairs and stuff because it is intense and then

00:25:18.10 uh I thought like this is kind of a funny way to to promote this thing and

00:25:20.23 you know maybe people buy it and you know it's silly and dumb and maybe they

00:25:23.20 can you know like grumpy old minute to their friends like I suggested

00:25:28.03 or whatever and then after it was over Eric came to me and he goes uh yeah tony

00:25:31.13 tony just texted me and was like hey man really appreciate all the all the

00:25:34.21 promotion on the on the waffle freshener but it's it's

00:25:38.00 been out of stock for a while should we reorder it or please I didn't realize

00:25:45.14 that's the most face thing I can think of doing is spending extra time

00:25:51.09 promoting a product that's unbiased that everyone hates anyway yeah that

00:25:56.01 everybody hates I enjoyed face break [ __ ] part two I

00:26:00.08 I liked it yeah it's a lot better than the first one it was the most nervous

00:26:04.06 I've been to do anything related to this show I would say by far

00:26:08.16 for the second one for the second one yeah why is that

00:26:12.16 because I I the first one I just I didn't I don't know I I um I mean you're an

00:26:18.06 immediate disadvantage by not being there because yeah

00:26:20.23 so like so much like 90 of that is just [ __ ] happening on the table

00:26:24.16 yeah yeah you're limited in what you can contribute

00:26:27.22 I I understand so it's it's yeah so it's like a layer of just not

00:26:31.04 liking my performance of it and then I like had a massive anxiety attack during

00:26:35.05 the first one and uh it was just so it was stressful

00:26:38.13 doing the second one but it was a lot of fun maybe we shouldn't do it

00:26:43.06 no I love no I love the second the first one was like the most draining thing I

00:26:46.21 just hated my performance and you guys were great in it but I

00:26:51.12 don't know it's just it was a weird thing well well I I understand I understand

00:26:56.01 that spiral of self-hate and doubt I I feel it that's why I stopped listening

00:26:59.12 to the podcast again after I started listening to it because I can't [ __ ]

00:27:03.03 stand me yeah and every and every episode that I

00:27:05.14 would listen to where I would talk I would say well that's the worst episode

00:27:08.13 we've ever done but I'll say from my end Andrew both episodes

00:27:12.13 I thought you were great didn't didn't show at all had no idea you were going

00:27:15.18 through some [ __ ] and it didn't it didn't wasn't reflected in

00:27:18.17 your performance I agree I'm thinking maybe we should wear headphones then

00:27:21.16 so we can hear Andrew in our ears instead of on a little telly behind

00:27:25.03 eric's head yeah it's it's like the timing of it is a little different than

00:27:28.12 doing uh a thing I know it's just it was it's stressful I felt like I

00:27:33.06 let you down and I didn't want to do it like it wasn't you guys were great I

00:27:36.19 didn't think the stream was bad it was more of a place of like I don't

00:27:40.07 want to let you guys down in some way especially something that you're so

00:27:43.15 passionate about Geoff so I was scared going into the second one oh you

00:27:47.16 didn't let us down at all no I feel like it's it's uh it's hard for

00:27:51.11 you in that situation because you're not in the room

00:27:53.13 but also because like if if time goes by where you haven't said anything for a

00:27:56.15 while because we like focus on the table all the cards and stuff

00:27:59.07 it makes it puts pressure on whenever you chime in again for it to be

00:28:03.07 something bigger than it is if you know what I mean yeah it's a weird timing

00:28:06.20 thing where sometimes like the room flow is so good I don't want to be like you

00:28:10.00 guys are doing like you're riffing and I come in

00:28:13.14 with a [ __ ] cowbell and it just is completely out of like

00:28:16.11 that's sort of my my you guys were great so it was stressful but I had a lot of

00:28:19.16 fun I I wanted to also just credit somebody in the community uh juliaria

00:28:23.13 made my Eric bed our thing I meant to talk about that but I just

00:28:27.00 I collapsed after we did the first break [ __ ] like it was

00:28:31.12 I was drained I felt terrible yeah that makes two of us

00:28:34.02 anxiety film they're on YouTube if if you've not seen them yeah but either on

00:28:38.23 the achievement hunter YouTube channel although it may be on

00:28:42.08 the face YouTube channel at this point if that's a thing

00:28:45.12 Eric please wait yeah Eric says they're both on the face YouTube channel

00:28:49.10 so there you go okay well that's good to

00:28:51.05 know that we've never talked about but I think exists at this

00:28:54.12 yes it does it came out I think today yesterday

00:28:57.14 we have a YouTube channel that is just the episodes right and then the break

00:29:01.12 shows and we've got some ideas for things here and there as well okay

00:29:05.13 I'm trying to go into my images so I lit the candle on fire you guys

00:29:09.08 ended the second break [ __ ] stream and I

00:29:11.12 came back to a terrifying image it was a close-up shot of the zimmer bear

00:29:15.17 just on its side like I had no context how we got there I didn't know what I

00:29:19.16 was looking at but it was just my full screen

00:29:21.12 was just zimmer bear sideways which is a terrifying image

00:29:25.05 I watched for like 30 seconds I think you were just boxing [ __ ]

00:29:28.08 uh Geoff at the end of the show oh yeah but it was just like the most

00:29:32.05 disturbing thing to come back to I burnt this it was like don zumer was

00:29:36.02 mad at me for like lighting the waffle thing on fire

00:29:40.20 dude you uh you sent me a an article I think I don't know this episode or last

00:29:45.04 episode we were talking about zimmer and you were talking about

00:29:47.01 learning about his life and some of the you know about him being in the coma and

00:29:50.12 stuff and I think you got a lot of that from

00:29:53.22 that article about his wife and how she scrap booked his entire career

00:29:57.12 and she seems like a phenomenally funny and interesting charismatic lady

00:30:01.22 but the craziest thing about that was was you sent me the article

00:30:06.08 and it's just a picture of her in her like office with all of her

00:30:10.13 zimmer memorabilia and right smack dab in the middle of it you cannot miss it

00:30:14.13 is the [ __ ] uh zimmer uh face that we have behind me in the face

00:30:18.21 and I could I laughed for like two straight minutes

00:30:22.06 it's so hard once you see it it's all you can see and it's so [ __ ] funny

00:30:25.20 I it made me want to read his books more because and maybe there just

00:30:29.12 is nothing outside of baseball but it's so tough to find information relating to

00:30:33.12 don zimmer that isn't somehow wrapped in baseball like he got married on a

00:30:37.12 baseball field like it's his whole life is baseball uh yeah 100

00:30:42.00 just a fascinating I was you know I was trying to do research I was trying to

00:30:45.03 figure out what foods he liked it was tough and I stumbled on this like random

00:30:49.22 excerpt from a book that is like baseball superstitions

00:30:52.16 I read the story of it was like in the 30s for a baseball team

00:30:56.10 and this team went on a winning streak and the coach demanded that all the

00:31:00.06 players eat what they ate on the first day of the winning streak

00:31:03.12 and this one guy downed like a whole glass of prune juice that day

00:31:07.07 and so for every day he had to drink prune juice like a full glass of it

00:31:10.12 they went on an eight-game winning streak so it was like eight days in a row

00:31:13.19 or I guess yeah I guess they're back-to-back games he had eight days of

00:31:17.06 prune juice and he's just miserable he's like the most excited he's ever been to

00:31:20.10 loose like he faced himself as just he happened to have prune juice on the day

00:31:24.04 of a winning streak it was like some random coaches like

00:31:27.03 keep doing what you're doing every day [ __ ] prune juice every day be

00:31:31.14 terrible never had that no tried pruning I've never there's no

00:31:34.21 reason we you know we should do we should all before we record the next

00:31:39.01 episode of face we should all get prune juice and then we should drink it

00:31:44.04 oh god and then see if it makes see if we have a streak see if we have a good

00:31:47.12 episode what is a prune but it's a plum is it I think uh

00:31:52.07 yeah I think that's right that plum I think it's a dead plum

00:31:55.18 yeah I have no idea what a prune is but what is the regulation amount of prune

00:31:59.18 juice we need to what are we doing for size

00:32:02.21 it's a raisin plum yeah that makes sense a raisin wait not like a grape

00:32:09.05 can I um I'm not sure what is confusing about like Gavin said it and then I

00:32:16.00 don't what's the confusion a raisin is it is a grape that is

00:32:20.06 dehydrated yeah it's like it's like the yeah it's like the raisin

00:32:24.17 equivalent of a plum so raisin is just a term for dehydration and fruit

00:32:29.11 okay that's yeah I didn't know that I assumed raisin was its own thing I

00:32:34.04 didn't know it was a general term that could cover

00:32:36.06 other categories well at least at least in the achievement hunter world

00:32:40.04 that's the case I don't know in the larger world is humpty dumpty

00:32:43.10 an easter thing

00:32:45.11 no because what we did speaking of okay well there's there's a reason for this

00:32:54.10 when we did the break [ __ ] to stream speaking of things they're like moments

00:32:58.11 that pass where you can't comment somebody mailed a bunch of packs very

00:33:01.18 kindly to you and you're going through the packs and

00:33:04.21 one of them was like easter themed and it looked like a giant egg which I

00:33:08.00 assume was humpty dumpty and I never really thought about the fact that

00:33:10.22 humpty dumpty was an egg which then made me think is humpty

00:33:14.02 dumpty and easter thing I don't really know the origin of humpty dumpty so I

00:33:17.11 just thought I'd ask I don't think he lived long enough to find out I just it's

00:33:21.17 uh I just wanted to ask is this it came to my mind we're talking about the stuff

00:33:25.01 I don't know how I got there but I was just curious I didn't think he was

00:33:28.21 I never I've never associated humpty dumpty with

00:33:32.05 easter it's part of the easter pack though

00:33:34.12 well I just I never thought about the fact he was because who would try to put

00:33:38.02 an egg back together when you break an egg there's no well

00:33:41.00 especially we're using horses of course a horse couldn't put an egg

00:33:44.01 back together oh yeah that's really weird that the horses were involved I

00:33:47.10 don't know what part the horses were in on I always assumed they wrote in but

00:33:51.13 you're right the wording do you think that when they said all the

00:33:56.02 king's horses and all the king's men they're talking about the king of kings

00:33:59.23 god and this is a whole metaphor where like

00:34:02.15 not even god could put humpty dumpty back together he's so broken

00:34:05.21 I think that's slightly deeper than what they were going for yeah

00:34:09.00 no I I never even considered who the king would be

00:34:12.02 that makes it religious because easter is a religious holiday maybe that's the

00:34:16.06 angle into easter ah so was he always an egg or was he a

00:34:19.14 man that died and then became an egg to make it more nursery rhyme friendly

00:34:24.23 humpty dumpty was his first was that a nickname what is the story behind

00:34:30.04 what is the origin this is vin diesel 2.0

00:34:33.18 origin quietly go ogling humpty dumpty how old was humpty dumpty during the

00:34:37.17 first fast of furious yeah we're in the fast and the furious

00:34:40.15 portion of the humpty dumpty doesn't give away the fact that he's an egg

00:34:44.19 it's not like eggy waggy on the wall no it's humpty dumpty it's like a great

00:34:48.00 name for a camel there's a pissed off camel

00:34:50.23 somewhere but he can't use that name through the looking glass has the humpty

00:34:55.22 dumpty stuff in it and in chapter six humpty dumpty is apparently

00:35:02.10 he becomes more the egg only got larger and larger and more and more human

00:35:09.22 what so an egg started inflating oh no that's terrifying hump so you're

00:35:16.12 saying that I could have got humpty dumpty in a carton

00:35:20.02 was his origin like he started standard regulation egg size

00:35:23.22 of a dozen eggs yeah he's just part of a pack he grew

00:35:27.12 it predates the Lewis car roll story huh okay sorry I didn't want to we didn't

00:35:32.23 have to veer off completely at humpty dumpty I was just curious it just popped

00:35:36.17 into my head oh it says as with a lot of these iconic

00:35:40.23 old tales though things aren't as they seem here

00:35:44.12 not at all incredibly the original humpty dumpty wasn't an egg

00:35:48.00 he was probably a cannon a cannon yeah the original story predates carol's

00:35:52.02 take on the character according to a number of military historians

00:35:55.06 humpty dumpty was the name of a cannon used by the royalists during the English

00:35:59.10 civil war the conflict ranged from 1642

00:36:02.00 to 1649

00:36:03.06 and in June of 1648 humpty dumpty was stationed on the walls of Colchester it

00:36:06.15 was one of several cannons erected to try and keep parliament's army from

00:36:10.06 taking the city dude humpty dumpty saved your country

00:36:13.07 Gavin I just like the idea of someone knocking over a cannon and it rolls off

00:36:17.18 a wall and that became a pivotal moment in human history

00:36:21.20 for decades and centuries to come the canon is named humpty dumpty yeah

00:36:27.03 uh let's see is it on like a little raised portion of the ground someone got

00:36:31.07 killed by humpty dumpty the next the next month however the

00:36:34.11 parliamentary forces heavily damaged the walls beneath humpty dumpty with their

00:36:37.15 own artillery you can guess where this is going humpty

00:36:40.12 dumpty had a great fall broke into pieces

00:36:42.17 as for that business of all the king's horses and all the king's men

00:36:46.01 it seems like those lines can be taken quite literally the royalists or

00:36:49.14 cavaliers were very much the king's men fighting

00:36:52.23 in support of king Charles who would go on to lose the war

00:36:55.23 uh yada yada so interesting so that's a good point how many people did humpty

00:37:00.04 dumpty kill he was probably a mass murderer I'd assume so

00:37:04.16 yeah can imagine sending horses in to fix a cannon

00:37:07.15 that's more unreasonable to me than fixing an egg with horses

00:37:10.18 I would never send horses for a candidate well no it's more

00:37:14.02 reasonable to fix an egg because a horse could do a lot more damage to a broken

00:37:17.10 egg than a broken cannon yeah but I feel like this is just gonna

00:37:20.14 make it work no I feel like a horse you just kind of gotta line the egg up right

00:37:24.01 like if you're fixing a cannon that's a mechanical level you're gonna need tools

00:37:28.02 a horse can't hold a screwdriver right yeah a horse can't hold a wrench

00:37:31.17 with a screwdriver that's why yeah that's that well I guess maybe in

00:37:35.03 its mouth it could there's probably ways that this could work that's the but the

00:37:38.15 problem with it's the great the great uh failure of a horse is that

00:37:42.23 it doesn't have opposable hooves that's what's it's what holds it back it

00:37:48.08 does I'd agree with that we all have passions that push us to do

00:37:53.18 big things in life like for instance uh being so obsessed with

00:37:57.20 video games that you uh play them constantly and then uh you

00:38:02.11 and your best friends all start a media company uh and then 18 years later

00:38:06.23 you do this ad passion comes from a deep burning love

00:38:11.06 of logistics and management no it doesn't it comes from a desire to create

00:38:16.13 and then to share that creation with other people that's where

00:41:32.21 e speaking of break [ __ ] and cards I have a I have a

00:41:38.10 thing I want to share with you guys that

00:41:41.16 I've been sitting on a while I talked to Geoff briefly about this

00:41:46.02 I don't it was quite the I stumbled onto William shatner's store

00:41:49.01 William shatner has a store and it is a strange thing you'd

00:41:52.18 it has stuff on it that you'd assume it's got things from his past

00:41:56.02 I'll just I'll link I'll put some links in this is something I'm gonna buy I

00:42:00.00 don't own a tie I'm gonna buy a tie from the William

00:42:02.17 shatner store it's from Boston legal it was worn by somebody who has in one

00:42:06.18 episode once I'm very excited about this

00:42:08.23 is that different to Boston less or boss and rob

00:42:11.20 they're all very different things they're completely okay but they're the

00:42:14.23 things you can get on a story he's selling a hall of fame award on his store

00:42:20.19 uh if you just want to own his broadcasting hall of fame one of a kind

00:42:24.18 you could do that but maybe the most egregious thing this is what made me

00:42:29.03 want to explore the absurdity that is William shatner's

00:42:32.09 store he's selling star wars merchandise

00:42:34.12 he just gives no [ __ ] I feel like that that'd be like a huge thing

00:42:37.16 that he wouldn't do I feel like there's a kind of line maybe it's changed over

00:42:41.05 time I'd love to see those links I'm stumped they're all in the chat set

00:42:45.12 of six danglers I don't know what a dangler is

00:42:47.19 where did the other great part no I don't I don't see you no no they're not

00:42:52.23 I'm all I see is eric's [ __ ] I well I don't

00:42:54.21 which one should I refresh are you in no I'm yeah I'm in

00:42:58.21 I'm in my opinion oh they're vanishing my legs are now vanishing

00:43:02.13 suddenly what is going on what is it real time take downs

00:43:08.15 he does hate gus what why can't I put there we go there we go

00:43:12.15 they're coming through they're coming through okay there we go okay why does

00:43:15.22 he hate gus uh it's gus's story to tell I think he

00:43:18.11 told the rt podcast but he did a panel with him

00:43:20.13 and somebody asked him a question or somebody asked a question about shatner

00:43:23.22 and he didn't like the question so he unfollowed or he blocked everybody that

00:43:26.23 was on the panel so he blocked us on twitter even though

00:43:30.04 gus has nothing to do with him that's ty he's selling star wars merch um

00:43:34.10 but what makes it great the hell he's just selling like weird stuff he writes

00:43:39.05 he writes the bios for like all the products he sells

00:43:42.02 like when you read the star wars one of my favorite things you go into the

00:43:45.05 description of it these ships in the set appear to be from

00:43:49.09 star wars episode one the phantom menace like they don't even know

00:43:52.02 it appears to be they're unsure Andrew you can buy at the William shatner store

00:43:57.03 a William shatner archives 1991 holly Hollywood walk of fame card that's what

00:44:02.12 I was getting to as far as the cards go look at this amazing

00:44:07.01 card he has two different cards on his store I'm gonna post it here look

00:44:11.07 at the grin he has he looks happy he looks like a man ready to sell you

00:44:16.13 frozen goods I could see that on the side of like a frozen

00:44:20.13 frozen like sausage box maybe uh a series of like breakfast

00:44:25.02 he a table goodies uh I would say he's starting to look

00:44:28.22 similar to don zimmer in his old age in the way that the face

00:44:32.07 the features of the face like retreat back into the skull

00:44:36.12 how old is shatner at this point he's gotta be he's gonna be pushing in 90s

00:44:40.09 he's close to 90. He is 90. He's 90

00:44:42.19 years he turned 90 this year in march what a great innings the other

00:44:47.05 card the 1991

00:44:48.23 Hollywood walk fam I'm more of a fan of the 2017 tops Allen

00:44:52.11 and ginter card oh the Allen ginter yeah I like that

00:44:56.21 I like the 91 because the the toupee is on point

00:44:59.16 there let's look at it I didn't notice is the two

00:45:03.06 is do you think there's a toupee uh for about 40 or 50 years now he's had one

00:45:08.08 thing dude that's a lie to buy that card or I gotta figure out if there's a pack

00:45:13.10 that I can rip it from to get that I mean these all kind of make sense

00:45:17.16 right like they're they're within the realm of of he's got tj hooker merch

00:45:23.19 oh my gosh this is where we get like this is the the real gem of the

00:45:29.05 William shatner store he just sells DVDs that aren't his that he has nothing to

00:45:34.02 do with is he like a distributor for other people's stuff

00:45:36.20 I just don't know is he just selling his it's like his own eBay where he's just

00:45:41.03 grabbing crap from his own cabinet it's it's it's everything that

00:45:46.00 he has in his collection apparently like when you read info about it but 1900

00:45:51.01 on a 2005 broadcast award oh my god who's that for we've

00:45:58.00 we've got to it's out it's unavailable we've got to find

00:46:01.18 this and watch it together no yeah that I was going to get to that

00:46:07.02 splat attack is something I'm very excited about the second one is on

00:46:10.16 YouTube splat with two p's is he is he have a paintball guy he's

00:46:15.18 playing it's William shatner playing paintball as a movie

00:46:18.19 it's and it's not it's not a movie it's it's his tale

00:46:23.01 it is like a documentary like it's not scripted

00:46:25.12 it is about how hiroki is it is trash yeah sadly this is the only way to get

00:46:29.12 splat attack the captain is back in an action oh in action

00:46:35.07 in the ultimate paintball showdown bursting with dvd extras splat attack is

00:46:41.12 simply unreal a weird and delightful display of

00:46:45.12 film crossing over somehow into the real world

00:46:49.07 armed with paint shatner doesn't sit in some celebrity tent

00:46:53.03 surrounded by agents and studio producers instead

00:46:56.11 even though the man is in his 70s he literally in all caps

00:47:00.12 takes command and races out onto the field to lead troops to the battle

00:47:04.07 he's on the front lines blasting away at the enemy wiping out more experienced

00:47:07.22 players with the bat of a hand there were no special privileges for the supreme

00:47:12.10 shatner far from it instead just like his alter ego captain kirk

00:47:16.17 shatner charges in while others fear to tread even when his men try to hold him

00:47:21.14 back yet like kirk even against the possible odds he somehow succeeds

00:47:25.22 do you think he's fighting the alien that's in the top right of that image

00:47:29.02 yeah I was looking at it goes on the left is just some humans wearing

00:47:32.01 paintball gear maybe some parachutes then a big alien

00:47:34.23 yeah then a big old alien there is a trailer for this and yes he is fighting

00:47:39.18 that alien he also comes in via parachute he enters the painful match via

00:47:45.05 a parachute mechanism of some let me just climb this flat attack trailer

00:47:49.21 I really want to watch this I'm glad everyone else appears to be on board

00:47:54.17 uh we need to buy this movie I feel like we should buy

00:47:57.11 the award as well and just have it the F**kFuckFacePodcast first award and it's

00:48:02.02 William shatner's 2005 broadcast and cable award

00:48:05.13 yeah yeah for sure how much is that award going for 1900

00:48:11.22 Eric we're gonna need you to buy that for us I feel like I wouldn't even want

00:48:15.09 to buy like his Oscar for that like why would you want someone else's award

00:48:20.04 make any sense because someone has his name on it for 1900.

00:48:23.17 It's a one-of-one dude it's 101 here's the trailer for splat attack

00:48:29.05 please enjoy it's very good I'm very excited about this

00:48:34.06 oh watch it watching it do we need sound ah it doesn't hurt he returns to action

00:48:40.10 shatner underscore log he's oh he's flying in it's a shot on

00:48:45.22 a video camera four by three on video what's going on is it a star trek outfit

00:48:54.19 it from what I can tell he he he maintained his superiority by only

00:49:00.12 allowing people to play paintball with them that were

00:49:04.11 invisibly worse shape than him I can imagine

00:49:07.18 working on this as like an extra and thinking this is beneath me [Laughter]

00:49:12.23 [Music]

00:49:15.05 Oh man that's [ __ ] oh tanks riot shields the referee it's got

00:49:21.12 everything you could possibly want in a movie

00:49:24.12 you know what's amazing that has been living on the internet for a while

00:49:30.00 it just being awesome and we had no idea until Andrew found it thank you buddy

00:49:33.12 it was the weirdest uh thing to discover it's just like also

00:49:37.09 here's another thing he has coming out party for sale

00:49:41.07 he's the only place you could buy hell on wheels season one unwrapped

00:49:44.12 like unopened like he's just selling an amc

00:49:47.08 show for some reason it looks like he shot this paintball movie but didn't get

00:49:52.08 the rights to any of the paintball logos like everything's blurred out

00:49:56.03 everywhere oh my god fandomstore.com what is that I have no idea I did not

00:50:01.01 explore I think it might be the answer to oh it doesn't exist

00:50:06.00 never mind log on well it's out of print as they said yeah

00:50:09.19 but even like so I just I posted a link for coming out party on dvd

00:50:14.11 it's a stand-up special this is how it's described

00:50:17.19 one-of-a-kind stand-up comedy it depicts seven gay guys hilariously explaining

00:50:22.03 their personal and their friends coming out story a great comical

00:50:26.06 stand-up comedy based on real life stories

00:50:29.05 each comedian takes his hilarious time on stage

00:50:31.13 like what does that mean like that is I looked at the amazon description it is

00:50:35.08 nothing like that I love shatner's editorials they're just

00:50:39.05 they're terrible so it's shannon's selling other people's

00:50:43.01 products and by the looks of it guessing what they're about without largely

00:50:48.06 yes just assuming making assumptions about

00:50:51.10 you could buy this is another you love collectibles Geoff you're the collectible

00:50:55.01 guy you can get us Emmy screener for shatner's rauner

00:50:58.17 which is the Kelsey grammer episode which ties back to the show we've got

00:51:04.01 some kills and grammar stories of the past

00:51:06.02 it's true it's a great connection but like once again a strange thing of

00:51:09.17 at the end of the product description these are from mr shatner's archives and

00:51:13.08 are marked with archive stickers on the reverse

00:51:15.20 the episode on the dvd is the Kelsey grammer that's how they wrote it

00:51:20.13 we suggest you keep them sealed as this show was never on dvd

00:51:24.12 and they will only appreciate in price given their rarity

00:51:28.12 so do not open it buy this disc from us but do not open it because

00:51:32.17 shatner's archive of shatner's raw nerve with Kelsey graber

00:51:35.20 is going to skyrocket in value oh that's fantastic it's just a weird thing I

00:51:40.22 recommend exploring the store I'm sure you'll find strange stuff there

00:51:46.04 it just seems like an endless well a bizarre I

00:51:48.07 emailed the story I've yet to hear a reply back but I hope I do

00:51:51.11 be careful there's no refunds by the way

00:51:53.14 on the entire store there are no refunds some of it is very aggressive they sell

00:51:57.11 they have like a category of things called items for a penny

00:52:01.00 and you cannot get more than two of them and they're very you could get a splat

00:52:04.21 attack poster though if you want for for one penny uh yeah that's eight by ten

00:52:09.22 we'll put that on the break shows that's that's

00:52:13.03 set stuff right there also batman forever enamel pin back earrings

00:52:18.04 a thing he had no involvement with like once again uh he has no ties to batman

00:52:22.06 forever he's not in it I don't know why he has that he was ep on some of these

00:52:27.10 well that's the so the question is is that a paramount movie because they have

00:52:31.12 when you go to the contact us page on a store they have an address and they

00:52:35.16 say don't visit this place but this is the address don't come here

00:52:39.06 it's not public and I looked it up it's just paramount studious

00:52:44.06 is his address so I feel like he just has like a corner of

00:52:47.02 like some lot of paramount and it's just

00:52:49.09 whatever they have in there he's selling

00:52:51.09 oh it's a weird thing I'd like I bet you

00:52:53.11 there are other strange celebrity stores

00:52:55.22 but I've I've never encountered anything quite like William shatters

00:53:00.12 yeah this one is uh this this is pretty fantastic

00:53:02.23 it also it's like it's of a time right like this looks like it was designed in

00:53:06.21 2003

00:53:08.09 yes and maybe it was and they it's still working I guess right

00:53:12.02 so I wonder if he knows he has a store I bet he does he's still pretty active on

00:54:40.09 award we can buy than William shatner's broadcasting hall of fame that was just

00:54:44.10 I don't know it's one of the weirdest things I've encountered so I've wanted

00:54:47.16 to share it for a while now and it just kept slipping out of

00:54:50.08 I feel like I got lost in it for a little bit going down a

00:54:53.22 chat in a rabbit hole could I I've I got one more

00:54:56.07 you're speaking of like things existing on the internet that people just don't

00:55:00.04 know about uh I had another discovery recently that I feel like

00:55:04.10 it feels very internet it feels very much like rap for Jesus

00:55:09.02 uh but undiscovered I went through and I listened to every state song

00:55:13.03 and I ranked them I did a whole list of state songs I listened to all of them

00:55:17.18 some states have multiple songs Tennessee is like eight different state

00:55:20.22 songs that I went through and one of their state songs this is not

00:55:25.09 the state song it is the official bicentennial wrap of Tennessee

00:55:29.16 I'm gonna post like here this I'm imagining the woman in the thumbnail is

00:55:33.18 rapping this is delightful it only has like a

00:55:36.18 very minimal amount of views like ten thousand twelve thousand views

00:55:40.15 the internet should know about the Tennessee bicentennial rap

00:55:43.11 how did you find this well because I was

00:55:45.12 going through state capital yeah but why were you

00:55:48.23 why did you decide to do that it was a jeopardy trivia question

00:55:52.00 of uh what state has eight capitals and the answer was Tennessee

00:55:55.11 and I was like I should listen to all the Tennessee capitals and then it

00:55:59.01 evolved to I should listen to every state capital

00:56:02.12 and rank them all and determine what it what state has the best capital song I

00:56:06.17 gotta listen to some of this this is the best rap song I've ever

00:56:09.12 heard in my entire life

00:56:13.11 it's good it's something [Laughter]

00:56:23.12 it's very good Jackson poke and Johnson three

00:56:28.06 god damn I really like whiskey whiskey sipping smooth

00:56:32.23 food pies here's a question this was from 1996 do you think she's still alive

00:56:39.07 I I believe that she uh is an eternal being Geoff I don't know

00:56:45.01 15 years ago this song is just a list

00:56:51.20 what was the budget for that do you think uh I don't

00:56:57.11 probably the same as the show I'd assume maybe she'll go halves he's on us with

00:57:03.05 us on the shatner awards yeah dude so you've ranked the ball how

00:57:07.16 long did this take oh this was like I did this all in one

00:57:11.01 evening it was probably like six hours the best one and it almost feels like

00:57:15.01 it's cheating to use like known artists but it's it's

00:57:18.03 west virginia's country roads take me home it's a great great song it's a state

00:57:23.11 song that's a state song that is the state song that is the

00:57:27.09 official state song of west virginia's country rhodes

00:57:29.17 number two once again it just feels like

00:57:32.19 sort of cheating it's Georgia on my mind by ray Charles specifically

00:57:36.12 is Georgia states long uh the worst on my list is main state of Maine main

00:57:41.12 state song terrible I'm gonna guess it's choir I ranked a lot of the choir

00:57:46.21 songs pretty low not into that kind of music

00:57:50.07 not into that kind of it's just not like you kind of there's kind of a limited

00:57:55.01 range I will say that like as far as surprises

00:57:58.02 go new Mexico has a banger of the state song

00:58:02.13 fair new Mexico it's just it's a vibe like it feels like it should have been a

00:58:07.13 breaking bad it's a great let me uh let me see if I

00:58:11.04 can find oh fair new Mexico what qualifies as a state song like it was

00:58:14.12 written specifically for the state it was written specifically for the

00:58:18.10 state and typically they vote to have it be like the official so like

00:58:22.22 Leonard skynyrd singing about Alabama that wasn't written for the story no

00:58:26.18 that was not that is not they did not go through the process to make that

00:58:30.16 the state song I think new jersey doesn't have a state song

00:58:34.12 and it's like they agreed that they were gonna have one but then the governor

00:58:38.23 just didn't do the paperwork so it doesn't

00:58:41.13 something like that like he just forgot there are like three or four state songs

00:58:45.18 that just stole the music from oh Christmas tree

00:58:48.11 they just are like this is a great instrumental track we're going to swap

00:58:52.19 temperatures yeah there's like four of them that are

00:58:57.03 just that it was quite the journey going state by state

00:58:59.19 but new Mexico's el faro new Mexico let's see is this the yeah this is it I

00:59:04.15 mean you don't have this is a four and a half minute song I don't think it's

00:59:07.17 necessarily worth listening to all of it but it's uh it's a bang as far as state

00:59:12.12 songs go oh fair new Mexico yeah oh I like the

00:59:16.02 the oh I'm telling you it's a [ __ ]

00:59:18.17 it's a banger of a song nice guitar work you don't want to

00:59:23.01 listen to four and a half minutes it totally sounds like it should be a

00:59:26.01 breaking bad like one of those like cold opens or something

00:59:29.03 yeah it feels like a breaking bad it sounds like it could be a song about

00:59:32.02 Heisenberg it does dude this song is awesome it's a great song

00:59:36.19 it's very high on the list of state socks great hell yeah it's the home of the

00:59:41.18 montezuma this is great I did that and then the next thing I did see this was

00:59:45.00 when we took two weeks off and I just missed you guys that I needed to fill

00:59:49.14 like activity as it's doing things I listened to every single original

00:59:53.16 song Oscar winner in ranked house as well so I got a full list I've listened

00:59:57.22 to every song that has won an Oscar for original song

01:00:00.20 I've been in the same boat as you I just keep taking photos of

01:00:04.07 of Pedro Martinez baseball cards and scanning him into Photoshop

01:00:07.12 I'm excited to see the end result yeah but this is this is a way more exciting

01:00:11.03 way to spend that that idle board lonely time than what I was doing

01:00:15.22 this is awesome so the worst apparently the worst song I don't even remember

01:00:19.04 what it sounds like but uh the movie was called papa's delicate

01:00:23.14 condition call me irresponsible 1963 the worst Oscar song of all time

01:00:27.23 the greatest Oscar song of all time is from tarzan's you'll be in my heart in

01:00:31.14 1999.

01:00:33.03 There's some songs that surprised didn't win oscars uh on the list

01:00:36.11 those are great great pieces the Oscar one took longer like the states was one

01:00:40.13 night oscars was like maybe four or five days

01:00:42.21 so what are you gonna do with what are you gonna publish these lists somewhere

01:00:46.13 I don't know what I I just wanted to build the lists I guess I could publish

01:00:50.12 them somewhere I feel like now that they exist they're they need to be official

01:00:56.19 the the official face yeah I'm just surprised yeah

01:01:00.10 you went with these like songs as your first

01:01:02.09 great face lists though like I feel like different dressings

01:01:05.15 would have been one of your very first lists well I'd have to go out and buy

01:01:09.05 dressings this is just me on YouTube I just listen to things it's a lot

01:01:12.04 easier I could just do this from the comfort of my bed

01:01:14.18 going through listening to songs there are songs I didn't realize were movie

01:01:18.01 songs like raindrops keep falling on my head no idea

01:01:21.16 but that was the butch casting Sundance kids song

01:01:24.14 a good ass movie dude a bunch of Christmas songs like white Christmas

01:01:28.07 that's a movie song that won an Oscar that's from a holiday inn isn't it uh

01:01:33.03 white Christmas uh where is that from it's funny doing these because you set

01:01:38.07 lines like there's the shaft line there was

01:01:41.18 the uh Mona Lisa line these different what uh yeah holiday inn white Christmas

01:01:47.01 you're right 1942

01:01:49.08 no not age great that one [Laughter]

01:01:52.10 no I guess not what what has at this point it was interesting listening to baby

01:01:57.14 it's cold outside like the verses were reversed

01:02:00.23 than what is commonly done well like male or female

01:02:03.02 reversed yeah like it opens female and then it goes mail and then it like it

01:02:07.09 goes back and forth where traditionally when people hear

01:02:11.03 that song it opens mail and it kind of stays male but the the roles reverse

01:02:15.22 uh within the movie and within the singing of the version that won an Oscar

01:02:21.07 it's fascinating it's a very historic historical very historical episode of

01:02:25.00 face yes the important history of Oscar movie songs and William shatner's award

01:02:30.00 history and and we got to the bottom of humpty dumpty don't forget

01:02:39.01 yeah we we popped the can on that controversy and got into it

01:02:44.21 uh Eric Eric wants us to start stopping so uh okay

01:02:48.13 we should probably does anybody have any any uh any [ __ ] they want to cover

01:02:52.10 before we stop do you think shatner's selling any

01:02:55.07 pieces of the humpty dumpty cannon yeah I want to buy some of his hair I

01:03:00.04 want to buy like a an an old hairpiece we should start selling stuff

01:03:04.07 from the show like well you should cut up your watering can and start selling

01:03:07.16 pieces of it we I want to start selling the cards we break you know

01:03:11.16 like like I was thinking I could put in a in like you know they have different

01:03:15.18 display cases for cards I could put your ice ice baby

01:03:19.04 thing that you made which was a vanilla ice card a vanilla ice card and then a

01:03:22.16 picture of a rad dude baby I think I could put those next to each

01:03:26.07 other three by you know in a glass case and sell a plastic case and sell that

01:03:31.09 sucker on eBay for [ __ ]

01:03:32.13 dollars yeah not not as much as William shatner's broadcast award

01:03:36.07 probably not but you know you never know you gotta start somewhere

01:03:39.14 oh also before we wrap I wanna do one thing uh when we were we were talking

01:03:42.18 last in person I guess it would have been that break show Eric mentioned in

01:03:46.17 passing just like I don't even know what the

01:03:49.06 context was but he mentioned again how long it takes to get dry with a blow

01:03:52.23 dryer out of the shower and uh once again reminding me that he

01:03:55.20 misunderstood the instructions of that and so when I was taking a shower this

01:03:58.21 morning I thought I would do something is when I

01:04:01.12 had my I mentioned this last episode I had some bad bathroom insights

01:04:04.20 very small very minor but I thought I would I would dry myself like I normally

01:04:08.02 do but I I timed the process to see how much

01:04:11.14 blow dryer you should be using to dry yourself off and uh it's 20

01:04:16.19 29 seconds so if you're blow drying more than 29 seconds

01:04:20.10 to dry yourself then you didn't dry yourself off enough with the towel so

01:04:24.23 I mean for a six foot tall man who weighs roughly 175 so

01:04:27.17 it's the blow dryer just to remove the clamminess post towel

01:04:31.12 yeah it's just like to hit those little like the crevices that are still kind of

01:04:35.01 wet and gross and to give you a night because you're

01:04:37.20 already blow drying your hair and then like then I noticed like oh my beard's

01:04:39.11 full of water so you blow dry your beard and that feels good and then

01:04:41.20 the water goes down to your neck so then you blow your deck and then before you

01:04:44.23 know you're like oh I can just continue this down I feel better I feel

01:04:48.13 great I'm not trying to I'm not trying to dive back into season one content or

01:04:51.20 anything I just thought for posterity's sake because it bugged me that he

01:04:55.22 he just walked out of a shower sopping wet and tried to dry himself off

01:05:00.23 and then as if as if my my technique was flawed

01:05:03.05 uh so I I drive myself security risk yeah

01:05:05.21 so what you should do dry yourself off and then and then uh about 29 seconds or

01:05:09.21 so is about the amount of time you should be under the blow dryer

01:05:12.15 and if you're doing more than that you probably didn't dry off enough why don't

01:05:15.20 they build a hair dryer why don't they build them into the shower heads

01:05:19.21 so you could just flip from one mode to the other dude I think that thing might

01:05:23.07 exist I mean our bidets do it for our butt holes right

01:05:27.14 it's true and I once used a uh I think it was a Dyson

01:05:31.13 tap in a bathroom above the sink and you get the water out

01:05:35.02 and then it switches to dry mode and it just fires

01:05:38.10 air down into the sink get all the water and blows it all over your shirt

01:05:42.13 it's a really great invention also this morning while I was doing that oh

01:05:46.18 my god I realized another this and maybe you guys are already doing this maybe

01:05:50.06 I'm late to the game but if you're not I want to throw it out

01:05:53.00 there because at 46 years never crossed my mind

01:05:55.20 uh we've been out of q-tips for a while uh we ran out we kept forgetting to buy

01:05:58.23 them at the grocery store so we bought some q-tips last night and I got so

01:06:01.22 [ __ ] excited to use the q-tips I dual wielded the q-tips and when I was

01:06:06.00 doing it I realized I've never done that before I've always

01:06:09.00 been a one-ear at a time q-tipper dual-wielded it it's a little stressful

01:06:13.09 because you try you're doing two things at once but

01:06:16.19 talk about a time saver I've cut my q-tipping time in

01:06:19.08 half but that's all [ __ I oh it doesn't do anything

01:06:22.12 it don't it does nothing but like push wax against your eardrum

01:06:25.22 the shite you shouldn't use it no it takes the wax out that's why it's on the

01:06:30.04 cuticle oh you need to wax it there nah you but the excess wax is

01:06:34.11 is is what it's pushing down and like impacting nah

01:06:37.17 I'm not doing that very bad for you especially to a time

01:06:41.10 I've had to fart for two hours can we end this I need to

01:06:44.15 I'm I need what's going on with Andrew I've been holding in a fart for two

01:06:48.19 [ __ ] hours can we end this thing well I've been holding it in why are you

01:06:53.00 holding it we can't smell it it doesn't matter to us it would be loud I don't

01:06:56.04 know I didn't I didn't want to interrupt I don't know

01:06:59.16 a loud follower well let's let's end it on your fart Andrew

01:07:04.04 fart us out live we'll we'll fart it out live Andrew this is

01:07:07.09 well you know the pressure of farting now like trying to capture it so it's

01:07:37.06 [Music]

01:07:42.16 [Laughter]

01:07:48.08 It sounded like a soggy engine trying to turn over

01:07:57.01 you sound like you're trying to start a lawn mower [Laughter]

01:08:09.07 oh why is that so good it was just really not disappointing at

01:08:13.16 all and it came over perfectly through discord

01:08:16.17 oh my god that was so loud did you like tilt up to do that or was that just

01:08:22.04 where you where you sat no no I put the microphone to my ass but I
