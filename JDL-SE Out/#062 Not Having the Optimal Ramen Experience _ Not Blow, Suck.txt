00:01:14.19 definitely get it I'm ready uh hello and welcome to episode 62.

00:01:19.05 I believe a face as always you're joined by myself man with no name Geoff Ramsey

00:01:26.23 and Gavin free hello back to back how are you two doing

00:01:30.15 oh never been better never been never been better

00:01:34.15 things are at an all-time high for for your old pal Geoff

00:01:38.20 how about you guys I you know what Geoff you've gone through a lot of misery

00:01:42.10 lately it seems with like house stuff going wrong all sorts of disasters I had

00:01:46.19 my own disaster that I wanted to talk about that I was

00:01:49.20 excited I was excited to talk about it's very rare that like something horrible

00:01:53.03 happens I'm like I can't wait to talk about this because this is one of the

00:01:56.19 most absurd me problems I've encountered in a long time

00:02:01.13 we've been very cooking centric recently and it is a cooking thing

00:02:05.22 but I tried to make ramen and like ramen's great love ramen don't have

00:02:10.19 it all that often with or without the keurig

00:02:14.12 without the keurig so that's that's an important no

00:02:16.22 no cure it because this was I typically buy and I think most people get the

00:02:21.15 pre-containered ramen like it's already in a thing you pour the water into it

00:02:25.12 you heat the water up didn't you seal it this was just ramen by itself like a

00:02:29.18 pot noodle yeah like a like a pot like a cup of noodle

00:02:34.06 style thing this is just ramen in a bag so just noodle

00:02:36.21 plastic bag got your whatever seasoning yeah that's how I do my ramen usually

00:02:41.07 it's just the packet really you do the packet

00:02:43.16 that's that's not that's a less it's a less common I

00:02:47.03 watched the whole thing about ramen recently it's not as popular as the

00:02:50.13 cup cup ramen it's way more pop anyway I typically get the cup ramen

00:02:54.19 so I've had this pack ramen and I could never and I don't know if this is just a

00:02:58.09 weird in my head thing I could never get the water boiling

00:03:01.17 enough I felt like to like properly heat the ramen like I'd always

00:03:05.21 feel like I was putting in like kind of medium heat water and it was

00:03:10.05 just doing nothing it was just soggy ramen like it wasn't cooking and

00:03:14.06 that this would drive me crazy go ahead so wait so in every recipe that

00:03:18.13 you've ever made you struggle with like step one boil the water

00:03:22.22 for ramen and in the plastic yeah well because I just I feel like I don't know

00:03:26.02 how to like I don't boil it enough or I just I'm bad at judging

00:03:29.23 what does it look like I don't understand that question what do you mean what

00:03:33.21 is it the war is rapidly bubbling like how do you not understand the

00:03:37.16 question okay well it's I you know you get the tiny bubbles you

00:03:41.12 get the tiny bit yeah yeah I understand like this is why this is why I open with

00:03:46.15 I think it's an in my head think I think I'm probably pouring [ __ ] lava into

00:03:51.01 the bowl when I do it but in my head I'm like this isn't boiling enough

00:03:54.03 I'm not doing enough there's no such thing as boiling enough boiling it's

00:03:57.07 boiling or is it you can't have hotter than boiling and

00:03:59.21 if it's below that it's not boiling what it is is I put I put it in the bowl

00:04:03.18 and then I cover the bowl and I can't see what the water is doing and in my

00:04:07.07 head I'm convinced that I've ruined the boil in the trash why

00:04:10.00 why are you covering it then well because you're supposed to keep the heat in

00:04:13.16 it's supposed to keep things I don't I'm just saying I have an irrational

00:04:16.21 I've always I have a rational thing when

00:04:16.21 it comes to heat with ramen in the water I feel like I'm never doing it right

00:04:20.23 the only thing that's going to affect your boiling water is your altitude

00:04:24.17 Andrew I feel like you've been very clear that this is irrational and I feel

00:04:27.20 like Gavin keeps pointing out that it's irrational but

00:04:30.15 does this affect you in other things or is it just in terms of boiling water for

00:04:34.05 ramen do you have trouble boiling water for

00:04:36.12 uh I don't know I was gonna say eggs but

00:04:37.09 you don't need eggs so I don't know what else you would boil water yeah I guess

00:04:40.18 your example would be maybe something like a tea

00:04:43.08 yeah or a hot no not really I don't know why there's something about the fact

00:04:46.13 that I feel like I'm supposed to be cooking this

00:04:49.01 I think there's a weird like thing in my

00:04:49.20 head of like I'm under cooking the ramen somehow I'm just ruining it I'm not

00:04:54.02 having the optimal ramen experience that I could be having

00:04:57.06 but I only have this in a bag this isn't an issue when it's in

00:05:01.05 a cup for some reason anyway so you could boil it and pour

00:05:03.16 into a cup but if you boil it and put the ramen in

00:05:06.21 yeah cause it's like I got an open-faced bowl and I don't know there's just um

00:05:11.22 I've said this so many times it's not a rational thing

00:05:14.10 it's just how my brain is I feel like I'm losing heat in the transfer

00:05:18.13 so I've been struggling with like well how am I gonna do this and so I came up

00:05:21.14 with the perfect way to make this and not have to worry about that

00:05:26.09 is what if I put the ramen in the boiling water instead of bringing the

00:05:30.21 water to the ramen I didn't have uh I didn't like have a proper like

00:05:35.05 pan that I could do that I never even like occurred to me to use a pan

00:05:38.17 the pots I have are too big I'm confused as to your

00:05:41.13 process before that then because because isn't that what you do you get a pan

00:05:44.21 you boil the water and then you drop the ram in it see that's that's maybe where

00:05:48.14 our confusion is I've never done that I've always poured the water out of the

00:05:52.00 pan into the bowl with the ramen in it I've never put the ramen in the bowl

00:05:56.04 I've been doing it the other way but you're supposed to boil the

00:05:59.18 ramen for 30 for three minutes right well you put it in the hot water for

00:06:02.20 like three minutes it's yeah while it boils yeah but like I

00:06:06.11 guess I don't know I just I've never it's never occurred to me ramen

00:06:09.19 okay yeah my mine's bubbling away and then I chuck the ramen in

00:06:12.22 and then it bubbles less because the heat in the water is going into the ramen

00:06:17.00 and then you still have the heat on for a few minutes

00:06:19.16 and then three minutes later you pour the sauce in and then you eat it yeah

00:06:23.14 exactly well I just that's where I was screwing up

00:06:26.06 when I was doing it in in a in a package I would move the water to the thing

00:06:30.14 because in a cup dangerous [ __ ] you're just pouring boiling water

00:06:33.18 into a bowl oh yeah I'm pouring it into a bowl yeah

00:06:36.12 absolutely that's that's that was what happened

00:06:40.13 so I thought I'm gonna bring the ramen to the water instead

00:06:45.12 and so I I put it in a [ __ ] kettle I've got this big kettle it's like a

00:06:50.00 ceramic kettle and it was ground like this is a genius

00:06:53.02 idea what do you do with pasta I don't really make pasta all that much

00:06:56.18 I'm not a big pasta guy I assume you wouldn't have that in the bowl

00:07:00.00 yeah I just I feel like that's a bigger bowl item than a ramen thing

00:07:05.05 ramen things are small real quick are you saying

00:07:07.16 pasta as uh to comfort or swage Gavin or is that also how you say it

00:07:12.05 I never know if it's past or pasta it's a Chevy Chevy chase situation for me I

00:07:16.12 never know what's right sometimes I say pasta

00:07:19.06 sometimes I say pasta just curious gavin's the only person I know that says

00:07:23.00 pasta so I didn't know if it was maybe you and

00:07:26.08 Gavin or maybe it's a Canadian British thing or you were

00:07:28.16 I don't know just it's like yeah gotcha much like you Geoff I'm trying to just

00:07:32.14 please people I don't know what they want me to say I'll say pasta I'll say

00:07:35.19 pasta it doesn't matter to me I never know it's correct I don't care

00:07:39.02 either way I was just curious as to the the reasoning behind it that's all so I

00:07:43.03 put the the [ __ ] ramen in the kettle and it's

00:07:46.13 boiling hot like it is there's smoke shooting at the end of it I'm like

00:07:51.14 this is gonna be great rom so I turn I turn steam I turn I turn the heat off

00:07:57.14 I'm like this is really hot I'm going to turn off and I decide no

00:08:01.16 I want to turn it back on I want to keep those bubbles going we got to keep we

00:08:04.21 got to get a good ramen cook going I walk away for 30 seconds I come back

00:08:09.16 all the water's shooting out of the kettle

00:08:13.03 covering the electric stove top smoke is shooting everywhere

00:08:15.14 as the water the water hits steam it's just it's it's going everywhere

00:08:20.17 there's a smoke alarm that I've set off nearby

00:08:23.02 it is 1245 a.m on a Sunday morning and if my fire alarm goes off

00:08:27.18 everyone in the building's fire alarm goes off and at that hour

00:08:30.21 I feel like there's people are going to leave the building at this time because

00:08:34.03 you're going to get a fix going off this is going to be a problem the steam

00:08:38.02 set off the smoke detector well no I was scared it

00:08:41.08 would because the whole [ __ ] kitchen just got coated like I couldn't see

00:08:45.16 it was just everywhere it was sizzling it's a stove

00:08:49.03 kettle it's not an electric one no no it's it's a stone yeah it's like

00:08:52.13 it's not an electric kettle at all it's it's like a heavier stone one so then

00:08:56.19 you're gonna see it in a minute I panicked I run out of the kitchen I

00:09:01.12 open up the patio door I'm turning fans on I am terrified

00:09:05.18 that this is gonna trigger the alarm it doesn't we're all good I'm like oh

00:09:09.23 thank god like this is what a [ __ ]

00:09:12.21 chaotic mess this is this is a true disaster I'm gonna I'm gonna then share so

00:09:17.10 what I realized I didn't think this plane through it's really tough to get

00:09:21.16 ramen out of a kettle it is not designed to wait

00:09:25.16 wait go ahead I've just missed an important part

00:09:31.01 okay the ramen is inside the kettle yeah I dropped the ramen in the kettle I was

00:09:36.14 cooking it all in the cabbage.

00:09:38.21 I missed that pot oh yeah no I put I put cause all the water is boiling and I

00:09:44.02 didn't have a pan so I'm cooking everything within the kettle what the [ __ ]

00:09:50.02 because it stays oily it's going to cook

00:09:53.01 well and it was a great idea I poured it it's the same as a pan it's the same

00:09:58.00 it's like you've put a spout around your pan that's all you've done

00:10:02.00 it's well it's a deeper I don't have any deep pans I feel like the pans I have

00:10:06.10 would not be deep enough for water to cook the ramen

00:10:10.12 how did she cook anything why didn't you keep saying pan put it in a pot

00:10:14.17 put it in a pot I feel like you got cookies in a pan you make

00:10:19.11 ramen in a pot yeah when I say pan I mean like saucepan like a

00:10:22.17 yeah pot that's what I mean okay well okay you must have those otherwise you

00:10:26.21 wouldn't be able to know I have a [ __ ] tank of one okay and it

00:10:30.16 just seemed absurd to cook this little square

00:10:34.12 thing of ramen in a tank of a paint how did you jam it

00:10:37.07 and it doesn't seem absurd to jam it into a tea kettle

00:10:41.03 you're gonna well I didn't jam it in okay it fit perfectly fine I put the

00:10:45.01 ramen in then all the water started shooting out

00:10:48.19 the broth and it [ __ ] caused the smoke steam disaster

00:10:52.12 we deal with that and then we get to the part where we need to

00:10:56.14 pour the ramen out of the kettle and it is

00:11:00.00 not easy to do that the shape of it is inconvenient

00:11:04.07 so at first because I got so much water this it's a big kettle so at first I

00:11:08.00 drained this literally only thing designed for liquid only well I

00:11:12.11 it's you can cook ramen in it too confirm this you can cook it but can you

00:11:16.10 get it out that's the dilemma Geoff so I start

00:11:19.09 draining the broth because there's way too much broth and I'm like

00:11:23.09 the kettle's [ __ ] hot how am I gonna navigate this how am I gonna move it

00:11:26.18 so my issue is I go to pour the ramen out of the kettle and then it goes like

00:11:32.03 it clunks down the kettle joined with the bowl

00:11:36.10 it locked into each other they became trapped

00:11:39.16 I could not remove the kettle from the bowl that I was trying to pour it into

00:11:44.17 and the bowl is half filled so we're gonna put this image in this is exactly

00:11:49.09 so you're about to see what happened to me so I'm trying to pour

00:11:53.21 the noodles in to the bowl that's not a kettle

00:11:57.05 it is that's absolutely a kettle how is that a kettle

00:12:00.14 what what is it talking about that's a kettle what do you mean it's a fancy

00:12:05.04 it's like a it's a ceramic kettle uh where's the top so the top pops off so

00:12:10.13 you see the metal handles on it you fold up and that locks the top end

00:12:14.23 you can remove the top of it okay pan with the lid no it is a I will

00:12:19.00 [ __ ] take a photo of this kettle later fully formed and you will see it's

00:12:23.05 a goddamn thing just trust me it is a fancy nice goddamn kettle

00:12:27.00 I don't understand the difficulty getting it out then because you're just

00:12:30.08 getting it out like you would any pot no because it's okay so it's super hard to

00:12:34.03 hold and because it's [ __ ] hot cause it's been on an oven forever I have to

00:12:38.12 hold the metal handle part and it's just not easy to navigate plus

00:12:43.05 with broth I'm putting into a small bowl

00:12:46.00 but the real problem of this story Gavin is it's now

00:12:48.03 locked itself to the bowl I cannot move either thing

00:12:52.02 I do have oven mitts nick there's in the [ __ ] photo it's still

00:12:54.22 difficult than ever you weren't there this was a real problem

00:12:58.22 so is the metal bar that holds the lid on is it gripped around the bowl

00:13:03.20 let me show you like yeah so like papa back

00:13:07.09 no you [ __ ] idiot yeah just pop it back like I didn't consider that I spent

00:13:12.05 20 goddamn minutes you're gonna call me an idiot you're the one making wrong

00:13:16.09 noodles look at the handle Geoff look at where it is

00:13:19.07 just pop it off looking at I'm looking at the most bizarre kettle on planet

00:13:23.11 earth Andrew.

00:13:26.17 I cannot I tried to lift the metal part back it would not work I tried to adjust

00:13:32.04 it forward would not work I cannot tilt the bowl because it's

00:13:36.07 filled with my [ __ ]

00:13:38.04 broth it's half filled with liquid so I'm just stuck there

00:13:41.23 hey Gavin 20 minutes trying to solve this hey Gavin

00:13:45.21 Gavin myself look at that Gavin Gavin real quick

00:13:48.23 real quick I'd just like you in this moment to take one oh let's take a beat

00:13:53.05 and just realize this is the person I aligned myself with

00:13:57.04 in the condiment argument oh bad next not with I don't

00:14:02.12 I don't write I don't know why I have all the things in your cabinets you

00:14:06.02 picked this contraption to cook ramen well it was the the most viable option

00:14:12.00 that was on on the top of the oven and I went with it and I didn't expect

00:14:17.03 it to [ __ ] lock it was like a facehugger on a bowl like I could not

00:14:21.16 there is no there was no hope I tried to teach you

00:14:24.23 how that kettle would work if there wasn't ramen in it it I assumed

00:14:28.10 it's very hot it still has the thing where you have to pour it from

00:14:31.22 yeah how do you get the the stuff out you just you tilt you pour it down the

00:14:35.10 the front the front end of it what do you mean

00:14:37.19 right if you could do that then why didn't you do that with a ramen

00:14:41.03 because there's way too much ramen to do it and it would just fall all over the

00:14:44.17 place I had to kind of guide it into the bowl

00:14:47.07 surely you did that with the broth no I did with the broth

00:14:49.14 I got a cup and I put it in and I I drained the broth that way until there

00:14:53.03 was an adequate amount but not too much because there was a lot

00:14:57.05 of liquid in that kettle it's a big kettle

00:15:00.15 the real dilemma you're [ __ ] caught up on this wrong details

00:15:03.12 I almost burnt the kitchen down and then I'm just trying to pour my ramen just

00:15:08.15 have a nice little evening treat and I it a lot I don't I can't even speak

00:15:13.11 it latches onto the ball so by the looks of it judging by the top

00:15:16.23 image there are two metal latches yes right so did they swing up over a

00:15:21.22 little they swing and then yeah and then you would hold them both

00:15:25.16 together as your handle yes absolutely that is how right okay

00:15:30.21 and then that weird that handle is the uh off the side is the spout I guess yes

00:15:35.18 the thing to the left that extends out that is the same that is not metal it's

00:15:39.08 the same it's all part of the same thing and no point with this device are you

00:15:43.12 ever expected to decant out the side while it's hot no

00:15:47.16 it is not designed for that it's not designed for ramen I mean we went over

00:15:51.02 this it was just a used best thing available

00:15:53.14 and it got latched on I didn't know what

00:15:55.14 to do because I couldn't push it forward

00:15:57.17 I couldn't pull the handle off of it off the back because it went down and

00:16:01.05 under and over you truly if you're listening to this and you truly need to

00:16:05.05 go and find the image on uh we will make sure we get because I

00:16:09.04 I don't know how I would have described it's not what you're thinking of if

00:16:12.21 you're picturing a kettle I promise you if you this is not a

00:16:16.06 situation where you can take what Andrew said

00:16:18.12 and draw his room from it you will not get to the kettle

00:16:21.10 bowl situation that you've got in front of you standard handles a part of the

00:16:26.04 cat is swung down and mated with the underside of the ball

00:16:29.00 and it appears to be like a nice ceramic bowl

00:16:31.11 I also like the fact that you've got yourself a drink you're like I mean this

00:16:34.19 for the long run is.

00:16:40.17 I did not butter my ramen okay yeah I had my water I was gonna just have a nice

00:16:46.10 nice what flavor what flavor is this ramen it's a chicken ramen Geoff that's a

00:16:50.17 great question we're gonna pivot I don't think I've told this story

00:16:54.10 but the moment it latched on reminded me to one other time in my life

00:16:58.03 you know when you were like a kid I'm gonna assume everyone did this and

00:17:01.10 it's not just a weird me thing you'd have like a cup of water on the table

00:17:04.18 and you'd like try to see if you could make a seal by sucking on it and then

00:17:08.06 like lift the glass off the table am I the only one that did this have any

00:17:12.21 any idea what I'm talking about continue I'm just asking that was a

00:17:16.23 question if either of you've done I've I've

00:17:20.06 not I've never tried to blow a glass of water now

00:17:22.08 not blow you suck it's a sucking thing it's not a belonging

00:17:24.19 why what's the goal of it well it's just to like create I don't know it's like a

00:17:28.21 dumb I'm a kid this is gonna be goofy I'm

00:17:31.21 lifting a glass of water without using my hands like I'll create a seal by

00:17:35.09 sucking onto the top of it it'll form around my mouth and then I

00:17:39.02 can lift the glass up I think I've done that

00:17:41.20 you think you've done it I feel like that's not like the craziest of kid thinks

00:17:45.15 but with gloss yeah well maybe like a cup it doesn't have to be a glass

00:17:49.05 it's just what came to mind just elevating using suction to lift

00:17:52.17 something like a a drinking thing off the table when I was

00:17:56.15 I'm gonna say 14 maybe 1314 in that range

00:18:00.17 it's 2 a.m and you know vos water and they have like those giant

00:18:05.12 caps I don't know if you're familiar with yes but they have massive

00:18:10.05 yeah they have massive silver bottle caps and I I had one on my desk

00:18:14.16 and it was 3 a.m and I thought about being a kid

00:18:17.13 and creating that seal and like sucking it up and I was like I'm gonna suck up

00:18:21.22 this bottle cap just lift it without my hands the dumb 3am idea I sucked it in

00:18:27.06 it slid from my upper lip down and locked onto my lower jaw like it looped

00:18:32.08 around my chin perfectly and it claimed once it was the exact it's the most

00:18:37.05 secured clamp I've ever experienced and it that's what it felt like when the

00:18:42.02 the kettle it fell securely and attached to your chin it attached to

00:18:46.19 my chin and it hurt like a [ __ ] it was so bad it was

00:18:51.12 like just the worst pain I struggled to remove it from my chin

00:18:56.06 I eventually did it took like probably two minutes I got it off

00:18:59.12 it's like that was stupid I'm never gonna do that again what a dumb thing I

00:19:02.15 went to bed I wake up going to my kitchen my mom says why do

00:19:05.20 you have dirt on your face that's like what do you mean I don't

00:19:09.16 have dirt on my face she's like get over here she tried to like

00:19:14.06 clean the dirt I gave myself two giant hickeys that were like

00:19:19.22 it sealed so tightly the lid gave me hickeys down like my left and right side

00:19:26.02 it was truly like a hickey goatee well how did you get multiples did it

00:19:29.22 like well because it clamped on both sides yeah it clamped on both sides like

00:19:34.06 it was a circular cap it clamped on both sides and I had equal

00:19:38.23 goatee hickeys down the left and right side of my chin

00:19:41.11 it was so embarrassing I didn't know how to lie about that injury

00:19:44.19 like so if somebody brought it up I'd be like I fell into a fence like I didn't

00:19:48.10 know what to say like I didn't want to say that I gave myself

00:19:51.14 hickeys by sucking out a bottle cap by accident because

00:19:54.18 it's a dumb thing but as soon as that [ __ ] kettle locked onto that ball

00:19:58.04 that's immediately what I thought of was that bottle cap because I was like

00:20:01.08 I'm [ __ ] how do I do that this bowl is gonna get hickey this bowl is gonna get

00:20:06.02 two massive goatee hickeys I cannot have this this is a great bowl

00:20:09.12 so eventually I decided this is what I'm gonna do I need to

00:20:12.20 tilt everything to its side that's the only way to get this bowl out of here

00:20:17.22 but to do that I need to obviously get it underneath a pot

00:20:21.09 why didn't you just drag the bar back towards the

00:20:24.17 I couldn't it would not let me like it's it the it

00:20:28.00 do you see how like the the width of it went beyond

00:20:31.09 what the yes the lip of the bowl was further out than what the metal thing

00:20:35.14 would let me pull I could not reverse the pull it was

00:20:38.15 latched on and there's nothing the only way I could get it out

00:20:41.19 is if I lifted it and like pulled it up and over the kettle was the only thing

00:20:45.20 so I got a bowl I'm like I'm just gonna pour everything

00:20:49.20 into this pot and we're we're fine and I'll just pour it from the pot

00:20:53.04 and to another bowl so the handle swings over mates to that one too

00:20:58.06 so what happens is I lift the kettle and I start moving the bowl and then this

00:21:03.07 happens immediately

00:21:07.01 the ball instantly shut that's how tight

00:21:10.16 the clamp was like as soon as I moved it a slight bit

00:21:14.13 the ball shatters in half my broth leaks out onto the counter and I just watch

00:21:18.13 sad as it goes over the side hits the floor

00:21:22.19 and it's just done so then I panic I grab napkins I clean it up

00:21:27.09 and that was my ramen I was trying to make ram and I broke the that that looks

00:21:31.05 like a bowl that's been in your family for years

00:21:33.05 it's an old bowl yeah I don't know I don't think it's valuable or anything

00:21:37.01 it's just it's a nice bowl did you get in trouble for breaking it

00:21:40.00 no no it's just my bowl dude I'm sorry I'm sorry you lost a bowl

00:21:44.03 did you no let me ask you a question were you able to salvage any of that

00:21:46.13 ramen or did you oh I ate all over again I ate all the ramen but it was

00:21:50.02 breathless it was it was a sad it wasn't great it

00:21:54.00 was a bad ramen experience did you get any uh

00:21:56.09 fun ceramic chunks it broke so cleanly it it's in three pieces it was a clean

00:22:01.10 it's good like it's easy to fix I'm gonna try to glue it back together

00:22:05.06 just haven't done it yet if that's if there's a pop missing it probably means

00:22:08.08 someone's trying to kill you though [Laughter]

00:22:12.00 what uh let me ask you a question what did you like did you glean any insights

00:22:15.05 from this experience is there anything that you've decided to take I'm not

00:22:18.10 gonna I'm not gonna cook ramen in a kettle

00:22:21.22 going you you shouldn't do anything with that cow you should bend that thing

00:22:25.18 no it's a great kettle

00:22:31.09 the bowl is my fault I put the bowl in that position

00:22:35.10 I put the angle where it was why not get a kettle with a spout that has just had

00:22:39.03 a lid on it it's like that scene in 127 hours when it locked you know

00:22:43.23 where like the boulder is on the guy's hand he's just like this is my life I

00:22:46.23 can't wow that happened that was the that was

00:22:50.17 the click once it clicked on I was like this is just I can't reverse this

00:22:54.19 we gotta deal with this somehow

00:22:57.05 I'll be surprised if that's ever happened to anyone else

00:23:03.01 it was just like the most absurd chaotic I almost set the kitchen on fire that I

00:23:08.23 broke a bowl using a kettle because the handle

00:23:11.18 you should sue the kettle company because this is how warnings get on ladders

00:23:16.05 you the end result could be you could be a warning on

00:23:20.10 all kettles going forward that could be your legacy

00:23:22.19 I'm gonna try and find a stove top kettle I wish I knew the name of it try

00:23:27.18 to find his kettle yeah oh my god the one of the first things

00:23:32.17 is it my kettle is like a hook over lidded k

00:23:35.18 I've never I can't believe I've never seen maybe they're more common than I

00:23:38.23 thought but put a link it I want to see I think

00:23:41.15 that actually might be the same kettle well it's not the same but that has a

00:23:45.12 complete spout it's not like a half spout

00:23:48.00 no that's a half spell that's that's it looks like the top comes off yeah yeah

00:23:52.23 oh so the other half of the spout is on the lid yeah

00:23:56.17 the other yeah the lid completes the spout as next

00:23:59.05 um looking at it I'm I think it it seems it's weird

00:24:02.14 uh seems like a functional tea kettle would not probably try to make anything

00:24:05.23 other than tea in it yeah I think that's a good idea oh

00:24:09.02 that's like a little dangly tea container yeah does yours have the

00:24:13.03 dangly tea container in it uh no I don't think it does I'm not

00:24:16.12 seeing any warning to not cook ramen in there yeah that's a two hundred

00:24:21.01 dollar kettle it's a fancy kettle it's a nice kettle was yours similar

00:24:25.18 it is similar I don't think it's that exact one but it's it's a similar idea

00:24:29.10 wow well I I feel uh I feel dumb then I guess I've never just I've just never

00:24:34.15 seen that style interesting kettle uh flex there

00:24:37.01 yeah I mean you know I gotta flex where I can't Geoff

00:24:41.03 I got sushi containers on the floor I gotta have like I gotta have something

00:24:47.11 that bowl flexed real nice the ball completely shattered I I love

00:28:34.17 what about you guys how how are how well

00:28:38.00 I think you should be looking for larger signs larger meanings in these things

00:28:43.11 that are happening these minor inconveniences

00:28:45.17 for example I'll I'll tell you how my day started out

00:28:50.00 yeah well yesterday uh I I need some tree work done right

00:28:52.10 um yeah need to have some might some canopies left that that's a dead tree

00:28:56.07 and the two trees that died from the great freeze that I had to have

00:29:00.17 cut down so I had uh had some fellas come out yesterday to do some tree work

00:29:05.08 because I don't schedule things on Tuesdays and Thursdays

00:29:09.18 because those are the days that I record annual pass

00:29:13.22 and uh this podcast currently and uh so I try to avoid

00:29:17.14 anything any people in and around my house those days I need

00:29:21.21 not only quiet so that I can record because I'm recording at home but I also

00:29:25.01 to be honest with you uh takes a little bit of preparation to get ready to

00:29:28.12 record podcasts and so it's nice to have a little bit of

00:29:31.02 uh time to gather my thoughts you know uh so Wednesday was yesterday I had some

00:29:35.03 fellas come out to look at doing some tree work

00:29:37.03 and I thought they were gonna do it then they did not they said well we'll give

00:29:40.19 you a quote it's going to be this much we said okay cool when will you do it

00:29:44.08 and they said it'll be a couple days we'll call we'll we'll call you

00:29:47.14 and get you on the schedule right and get you on the books like no problem

00:29:51.14 this morning I got up Emily went to work I had coffee with minor league fan jack

00:29:57.03 this morning and uh so I left my house at

00:29:58.23 845 or so to go see minor league jack came home at 10 to uh what appeared to

00:30:04.00 be like 12 dudes in various trees around my house with chainsaws

00:30:08.13 just going [ __ ] ham all over my yard which is super appreciated you know I

00:30:13.20 wanted to get the work done would have appreciated a heads up

00:30:17.06 probably would have told him not today because I need to record uh audio

00:30:21.11 podcast there there were if there was if there

00:30:24.11 was was one chainsaw there were 20.

00:30:26.12 There were I saw at least four chainsaws going it was very loud

00:30:30.02 so uh I was like I look at my watch I'm like well [ __ ]

00:30:34.10 uh I got three hours maybe they'll be done and then I

00:30:37.09 you know went about my life proceeded to uh get ready for the podcast as much as

00:30:40.17 I can amongst all the noise I super appreciate that they're doing the work

00:30:45.11 doing great work as we get closer to the podcast

00:30:48.16 I have a I have arrow in her crate because I have to leave the door open

00:30:52.02 for her uh otherwise you know if she encounters one ounce of resistance

00:30:56.15 she will just piss and [ __ ] immediately where she is yeah so

00:30:59.20 I have to I have her in the crate she's napping uh and I'm getting ready for the

00:31:03.14 podcast about 15 minutes before the podcast

00:31:06.11 starts the last one we recorded I've given up on the idea that there won't be

00:31:10.04 chainsaws I'm just hoping that you all don't hear them

00:31:12.18 judged by the fact that uh I haven't heard from you guys complain I don't think

00:31:17.09 that you did at any point nice yeah you also didn't notice when I got

00:31:20.16 up in the middle of a podcast and left to go

00:31:22.22 tour the yard and give the guy a check but all that happened while we were

00:31:26.04 recording as well in this one uh the last episode yeah and uh

00:31:30.20 why well I had because the guy rang my doorbell and I had to go talk to him

00:31:35.23 maybe say that though we could have just stopped what would we do

00:31:39.05 don't worry about it say it'd be a fun game for the audience see if you can go

00:31:42.12 back in time and figure out when I was paying a bill uh anyway so uh

00:31:46.21 about at about so we recorded one today at about

00:31:50.12 1245 uh I realized we're still doing uh it and uh it actually wasn't

00:31:57.18 it might have overlapped with the discord disconnect but it wasn't had

00:32:01.07 nothing to do with it so I'm answering nick in the chat uh so

00:32:05.15 it's 15 minutes to go we're about to record I'm trying to figure out how the

00:32:09.14 [ __ ] I'm gonna communicate with you two when I'm uh so

00:32:12.23 disappointed in you both uh in the moment and uh trying to

00:32:16.09 collect my thoughts listening to the chainsaw realizing that that's that's just

00:32:19.10 I'm just gonna have to deal with that there's no way the universe is gonna let

00:32:22.14 me off the hook on the chainsaw stuff uh anyway and then arrow barks once I

00:32:27.01 hear her I'm gonna go all right uh she probably

00:32:29.19 wants to get out and go to the bathroom I can't really let the door open though

00:32:33.01 because there's dudes outside with chainsaws and it would scare Henry and

00:32:36.02 it might scare arrow you know and so but I get up to go check on her

00:32:40.04 and as I uh and by the way this I'm already you guys I already have discord

00:32:44.04 open I'm about to join the chat room I see you guys in there

00:32:46.22 and arrow barks once so I go into the into the laundry room and she's standing

00:32:52.19 in her crate pissing all over it and I go wow that was the one bark notice

00:32:56.23 I got great so I open the crate up uh and of course the underside of her is

00:33:00.12 covered in piss and of course all of her bedding is

00:33:03.06 covered in piss so I take her out and I give her a little

00:33:06.21 quick bath in the in the hallway there still can't you know I'm still not going

00:33:10.08 outside because of all the chainsaws and stuff

00:33:13.08 and and so I get I wet some towels down and I scrub her clean and I get her nice

00:33:16.19 and clean and I think well at least she's peed now so

00:33:19.10 uh I don't have to worry about her having you know barking while I'm doing

00:33:23.00 the podcast or whatever and then I take her bedding and I take the

00:33:27.03 all the bedding out of her crate and I start washing it and then I

00:33:30.12 scrub the bedding or I scrub the bottom of the crate uh

00:33:34.00 because there's a little bit of pee there and get it all cleaned up and then

00:33:37.14 I stand up and I look and I'm like oh I have like

00:33:40.15 seven minutes I did it pretty fast I'm feeling pretty good about that

00:33:45.05 I turn around to see a line of uh dog [ __ ] across my house

00:33:48.08 uh she didn't just have to pee she had to [ __ ] and you know arrow doesn't like

00:33:52.06 to [ __ ] all at once she likes to make a journey out of it uh like a maybe it's

00:33:56.20 bread comes so she can find her way back to the original turd I don't know

00:34:02.08 but uh so then I had to uh clean a rug and clean up four piles of dog [ __ ]

00:34:06.07 all then to race back in and sit down with one minute to go

00:34:10.08 to start the podcast with you lovely people and

00:34:13.11 I got to thinking why I was telling you Andrew you should look for larger

00:34:17.01 meanings in life I realized that this is my fault because I I got on

00:34:21.01 my high horse and I I said I understand that my place in the universe is

00:34:26.02 on a level that is par with [ __ ] but that that was where I

00:34:30.10 I misspoke I misread the tea leaves what the message was

00:34:34.07 is I'm not on a level as as [ __ ] I am one level below

00:34:38.14 [ __ ] so I apologize to the universe for for attempting to say that I am of

00:34:43.12 the level of feces I recognize that I am I'm more like the universe's doormat

00:34:49.12 and I'm the thing that like you guys when you go into your house and you

00:34:53.13 don't want to bring [ __ ] into your home or into your lives you'd like to leave

00:34:56.19 the [ __ ] outside so you wipe your shoes off the mud and

00:35:00.15 the [ __ ] you wipe it off on a door I am the universe's shitty doormat

00:35:04.01 uh is is uh what I've gleaned from uh well 46 years but certainly from

00:35:08.17 today and so I was I would say to you Andrew maybe

00:35:11.08 maybe look for there the universe might be telling you something uh in that

00:35:14.20 kettle story that's hmm I'll have to analyze what it is telling me I do have

00:35:21.03 it's an unrelated update but I feel like I need to offer you

00:35:25.17 an official apology Geoff about what the universe is spoken

00:35:30.05 in a weird way we made fun of your your your recipe

00:35:33.17 I don't want to go back to the whole condiment thing but

00:35:37.17 I just uh I just I just got this notification

00:35:41.14 a french fry company has responded to my family recipe

00:35:45.17 which is your recipe calling it absolutely delicious

00:35:50.06 your recipe is approved by a fry company I feel like it officially is

00:35:55.07 in the condiment thing I can't argue against the verified

00:35:59.07 I don't know but it just happened universe works in weird ways

00:36:04.04 Geoff I apologize yours is absolutely a condiment

00:36:07.23 well apology accepted thank you Andrew uh and they do make tots

00:36:12.13 uh yeah but uh I don't think the universe wants me to win

00:36:17.17 any so um you know I I don't know or duh

00:36:20.23 potatoes they side with you that's a win and so you gotta win

00:36:24.12 you won a lot in Vegas you've got some wins I thought

00:36:28.01 I would go a day without cleaning up [ __ ] but I did not

00:36:31.22 I did not do you have like a board in your house at this point of like days

00:36:35.03 since I've had the clean [ __ ] you're just constantly

00:36:37.18 no there would be no past one that would be no it would just be yeah it'd be

00:36:40.18 extra work to erase it every day do they make it like a special [ __ ] back

00:36:45.07 no I don't know I don't know I don't know do you have to deal [ __ ] in Vegas

00:36:52.05 kind of I was in Vegas fair enough a fair point Vegas is [ __ ] man I'm

00:36:57.12 vaccinated and all and and yeah but man Vegas is a is a throng of people

00:37:02.15 and well you just really tested out that obnoxious yeah scary people

00:37:07.14 man vega scares the [ __ ] out of me it just you always just see

00:37:11.17 crazy stuff like I was just behind I was behind someone I know

00:37:16.13 watching them play roulette some guy walks up

00:37:20.21 drops about five grand on a single number like the only bet

00:37:24.06 it immediately lands on that number and he walks away with close to like 200

00:37:28.00 grand without even changing his facial expression

00:37:31.05 and I just looked at the person I was with I was like what has happened

00:37:35.07 like what just what just happened right in front of us and was that normal for

00:37:38.19 that guy that way it was mental what's the odds

00:37:41.20 of that it's like 30 something to one he's probably like uh keep it together

00:37:45.01 keep it together yeah you look you look cool right now

00:37:47.14 freaking hotel room the coolest moment of my life because

00:37:51.02 because in my opinion five grand is an obscene amount of money to place on a

00:37:54.23 single bet like that's a heavy loss but to get

00:37:58.00 200 like what is it like 180 something back that's life-changing

00:38:03.02 yeah it just maybe it just wasn't to him maybe it was just like

00:38:05.23 and I'll put it with the others because he does it all the time yeah we were

00:38:09.02 just so confused as to like did he know like how could he know maybe

00:38:13.11 maybe he was maybe he was so far in the hole he's like well that's a start

00:38:19.03 that is yeah maybe I just still to this day it like the whole experience

00:38:24.15 it was you know slightly amazing but mostly terrifying

00:38:28.21 just how it played out in front of us as if like nothing happened

00:38:31.23 I just don't want to know anything more about that guy well that's uh

00:38:36.00 that's like the fun of most of the fun of Vegas for me especially now that I

00:38:39.22 don't drink anymore is just watching people it's like the best people watching

00:38:45.05 because it's like it's people that are it's cutting loose

00:38:48.17 or you know just going wild or are losing money and freaking out or winning

00:38:53.11 money and freaking out or winning money and being very calm and

00:38:57.20 collected apparently that's the first I've heard of that

00:39:00.11 uh it's just it's just it's never dull you know

00:39:03.11 it's a high risk scenario though in Vegas because like let's say

00:39:06.10 great people watching is like at a blackjack table but then you have the

00:39:09.20 pressure if you don't want to be the person [ __ ] up the table

00:39:14.13 it is oh yeah the table etiquette I got called out I was playing

00:39:17.21 I was doing like an online casino thing where I was playing blackjack

00:39:21.06 and I got called out there and I felt like a little kid in school like even

00:39:24.14 the dealer was like what are you doing stop doing that and I just like I wanted

00:39:29.02 to hide you got called out online I got called out online just somebody

00:39:33.03 else up online etiquette well because I kept splitting tens

00:39:36.12 because I was like I feel lucky today and you're not supposed to split tens

00:39:39.15 it's like a low probability unless you're in like a tournament is the only

00:39:42.16 context where you'd want to do that and uh I guess it's bad table etiquette

00:39:47.22 so people uh people like two people at the table are

00:39:50.19 like that's the third time you split tens why are you doing that stop

00:39:54.11 doing that and then the dealer was like stop the game was telling me like the

00:39:58.03 math probability of why I shouldn't split 10

00:40:00.18 the whole table is mad at me that's just in my living room and I felt

00:40:04.09 so embarrassed and like I'm sorry I'm just I'm playing

00:40:07.12 I didn't mean to [ __ ] up your thing so

00:40:09.20 you like on audio like can you hear each other

00:40:11.18 uh no I have no Audi like you the dealer has audio nobody else does

00:40:15.18 you could text chat if you want to I never do I guess I just don't know the

00:40:19.14 I don't know the rules of blackjack so I don't really understand I is

00:40:22.06 is that the one where you can like wreck the entire game for everyone else by

00:40:25.14 what you by what you're doing I think there are

00:40:27.21 like certain bad plays and good plays that it is standard I'm not super

00:40:31.01 knowledgeable blackjack you're just trying to get as

00:40:33.14 close to 21 without going over yeah you can't really [ __ ] anybody else

00:40:37.01 over with your bad decisions in black yeah that's what is craps the one where

00:40:40.06 it's like your moves affect everyone else's I mean if you roll shitty

00:40:44.05 I think you can in black because I think it's dependent on like what card the

00:40:49.09 dealer has so like you can make bad hits or or like stays depending on

00:40:53.12 what I just don't understand why if it doesn't affect

00:40:55.17 other people at a table why are they annoyed well because because I'm taking

00:41:00.17 cards from the chute that could potentially harm the dealer

00:41:03.23 and I'm already in an advantageous position like I'm probably going to win

00:41:07.09 anyway so I might just be [ __ ] up for everybody else and I also I'm already

00:41:12.02 ruining like a near perfect hand to like out of greed essentially so

00:41:16.06 they're upset but I I stopped playing for like eight

00:41:18.21 months after that because I was so embarrassed

00:41:20.22 like it was just it was like I don't want the dealer to yell at me that's just

00:41:24.15 having some fun have you done real Vegas in front of real people

00:41:28.08 I've never done real Vegas in front of real people when you do

00:41:31.12 can I be there yeah you and I will be we're gonna be like

00:41:35.16 swingers at like the budget table just people watching

00:41:38.09 I think you could be that guy you could be the guy who walks up to his first

00:41:41.09 table drops five grand and walks away with hundreds of thousands

00:41:45.16 I would not be able to contain myself I could not be the calm I would blow the

00:41:49.20 moment I would immediately become extremely uncool in everybody's eyes

00:41:55.07 it would be very apparent that I was stunned

00:41:57.11 I'd not be like this is nothing guy that couldn't be me another weird Vegas

00:42:01.10 experience I had I got into a I was with dan we got in a lift

00:42:04.19 and some other woman got into a lift too and her

00:42:07.18 her purse was like overflowing with chips and she was like spilling them all

00:42:10.21 over the floor like on the way to the left and like she

00:42:13.23 the door closed and she'd lost someone they were all over the floor of the lift

00:42:17.12 and we helped to pick them up and they were all like

00:42:20.18 thousand dollar chips and I was just like I had like I had like 10 grand of

00:42:25.03 hers in my head I was like oh my god you've she must have had like

00:42:29.00 80 grandsworth or something I was just like man you're you're rich

00:42:33.03 off the off this one Vegas trip did you encounter the person who robbed

00:42:36.21 the 200000 guy is this like second part of the story

00:42:40.03 like you have you've seen two ends of this thing without realizing it

00:42:43.10 just the way she was treating them though was really mind-blowing

00:42:46.17 they looked like they were tens or something but she was just spilling

00:42:50.05 thousands all over the floor I was like you left you've left probably two or

00:42:54.09 three grand outside the lift downstairs she was like yeah she was really drunk

00:42:59.14 she was like yeah I don't lose anymore I was like

00:43:02.00 oh my god I was tempted to like go back down

00:43:05.02 after her what's the [ __ ] the name of the baron spyro that has like the sack

00:43:09.11 of gems like this is what I'm imagining of this woman with like a sack of poker

00:43:12.23 chips just leaking out the bottom being careless yeah we made sure like

00:43:17.21 we made sure she got to where she was going without dropping anymore because

00:43:22.01 she was all over the place and I think by the time

00:43:24.18 I don't think either of us went back down to see if there were any left on

00:43:27.20 the floor but I assumed someone found him [Laughter]

00:43:31.17 Gavin told me that he has great roulette luck one time I'm 100 on roulette nah

00:43:36.21 you're not are you one for one are you like 10 for 10

00:43:41.08 what's what is 100 for you I'm disputing this yeah what is your hundred percent

00:43:46.21 you made it I in my head it you're like four for four is what yeah like roughly

00:43:50.14 yeah that's 100 because Bernie Bernie uh you know a guy we started or started

00:43:54.02 roosting with he likes to brag that he has a perfect

00:43:56.18 field goal kicking record because he's one for one

00:43:59.12 I don't think that counts so Gavin might have be a hundred percent roulette

00:44:03.05 because he's done played roulette once and won yeah I did um

00:44:06.14 I just I went on colors because I don't understand I I'm just

00:44:10.01 I don't understand any gambling really it's like the simplest stuff so I just

00:44:13.07 like put up put 100 on black got 200 put 200 on

00:44:17.01 black got 400400 on red and I think I did it four times

00:44:21.00 and I won four times I just thought I'm up on Vegas forever now if I just walk

00:44:24.00 away yeah the way the way gambling works for people that don't gamble a lot is

00:44:28.17 essentially you go up to a complete stranger in front of other

00:44:31.23 people and you give them an amount of your money like

00:44:34.21 a hundred bucks let's say and then you say do something complicated in front of

00:44:39.09 me and then keep that money and then they do

00:44:42.15 that's typically that's typically how it works

00:44:45.01 and then you go thank you thank you I don't exactly understand why I don't

00:44:48.12 have my hundred dollars anymore but uh people around me seem to be having

00:44:52.17 fun so I guess I am too dan was like annoyed by my luck so he he then went in

00:44:57.16 I think I'm on a couple of them he was betting against me uh and he lost twice

00:45:01.07 and then he was and then we were like well you know if

00:45:03.19 if you put that money in again and you win

00:45:06.23 uh be like uh nothing ever happened and he kept doing it

00:45:09.18 it landed on green twice back-to-back he was livid

00:45:15.22 oh it's a great way to lose though like that's almost as good as winning that's

00:45:20.08 better than it just being the other color

00:45:22.07 I want to lose gloriously if I'm going to lose I just hate on roulette

00:45:25.21 a lot of the tables there's a screen that shows all the previous results

00:45:29.17 yeah as if that has anything to do with what's going to happen next

00:45:33.00 what is there to do is choice in your mind yes

00:45:36.00 well you don't you don't understand the mind you are not a gambling man Gavin it

00:45:39.07 is if there is four blacks in a row it is

00:45:43.00 universally impossible to be black again it cannot happen

00:45:46.09 that's how that's a gambling brain works you put everything in on red on that

00:45:49.12 play and I don't know how rigged the tables are like I assume that

00:45:53.19 they must be in a way I don't I wouldn't I don't think so

00:45:57.01 I think they're rigged at all I just think the games are so tilted for the

00:46:01.06 rule set the game the game is rigged uh just in itself yeah yeah like you could

00:46:07.04 theoretically count cards to like increase your probability of winning or

00:46:10.19 like making smart bets in blackjack and it's just illegal like you just can't do

00:46:14.00 it they won't tolerate it yeah how do they prove you're doing it

00:46:17.10 uh because you're betting them out so like typically if you're

00:46:20.09 you want to see a majority of the cards right so you're gonna be making small

00:46:23.20 bets and then once the shoe becomes more beneficial to you

00:46:27.12 like there's a lot of face cards in it or tens

00:46:29.22 then you start making higher bets because you have a higher probability of

00:46:33.09 winning off of those hands that just seems like a part of the game

00:46:36.17 to me I just don't understand it is that that's but that's why I'm saying

00:46:38.00 they don't need to rig the games because the rules are rigged within themselves

00:46:42.17 right it's I wouldn't be surprised if you were a

00:46:46.08 multi-millionaire Andrew just off gambling oh

00:46:50.21 you just never told us well the reason I know about your perfect roulette record

00:46:54.12 is I went like a historic 0 for 28 in roulette place or

00:46:58.12 I just couldn't win like it mathematically impossible like the five

00:47:03.07 blacks in a row I couldn't win and I kept doing black

00:47:06.05 black I was like yo I was doing the color thing

00:47:08.18 doing the the Wesley snipes always been on black thing I bet on black always red

00:47:12.14 always red no matter what I did even in animal crossing there's a

00:47:16.12 roulette game you could play that was red

00:47:18.12 I just kept losing on red so I talked to you about roulette randomly and you're

00:47:22.12 like yeah I'm undefeated and roulette every time I go to Vegas I'm I've win

00:47:26.23 I'm like five for five unstoppable you we went over four the two of us

00:47:31.08 I'd ask you what color to put down and then you're just like oh I guess it just

00:47:34.12 doesn't translate over I guess I need to be there no I think we

00:47:37.13 need to be doing it in person okay and I would be willing to come out of

00:47:41.04 retirement on a real-life roulette table with you and you just bet with me and I

00:47:46.00 think we'll be in it either you'll destroy everything I've worked towards or

00:47:50.15 we'll just continue as normal and you'll be you'll be up on it that'd be great

00:47:54.12 we're going to let's hope you don't bring me down oh I'm going to bring you

00:47:58.06 down absolutely if you guys if you guys win big in Vegas

00:48:02.13 you need to immediately go and buy the two nicest ceramic tea kettles

00:48:08.04 to celebrate.

00:48:12.06 I like this one like the like if if if I don't know if like Celine or hermes

00:48:19.11 or givenchy makes a tea kettle yeah and if it's like encrusted in

00:48:24.13 like diamonds and you need to buy it I did that with um I didn't buy a kettle

00:48:31.01 this is just gambling stuff um my guardian for rtx Charles who I now

00:48:36.13 work with one of my favorite people we went to Vegas for something

00:48:40.23 and um I was trying to convince him to gamble he was like no you know I'm never

00:48:44.21 gonna do that it's not me I'm not gonna do it

00:48:46.23 and I just sat down at a slot machine I don't have anything special with slots

00:48:50.10 like I just I just lose money in those and uh I just

00:48:53.09 play like kind of low amounts he sat down next to me at a slot machine

00:48:57.09 and uh you know they come around they offer you free drinks and stuff if

00:48:59.01 you're actually gambling but he wasn't doing anything at his machine I was like

00:49:02.17 look you're gonna sit here let's just just

00:49:06.01 put in a dollar just see what happens and he was like oh fine like caving to

00:49:11.03 the peer pressure he won six hundred and fifty dollars off

00:49:16.08 and he I don't think he ever spun again I think he just cashed out and that was

00:49:21.01 it and I was like man I've got I must be providing a little bit of luck

00:49:25.15 so I I would love to test that out with you Andrew at

00:49:29.17 in Vegas at some point I think my bad luck counters your good luck and it's

00:49:33.11 not even close as lucky as you are it's not even a statement on how lucky you

00:49:37.16 I'm sure you're incredibly lucky I I don't think I think I I overpower in the

00:49:42.10 back yeah I gotta agree with that I think those

00:49:44.08 and those opposing forces Andrews uh I don't know

00:49:47.13 if it's luck or karma or whatever but I feel like it's a lot stronger

00:49:51.03 yeah I don't honestly I don't think my I don't think Charles winning was my luck

00:49:54.12 transferring it was just he's very lucky uh because when I watched dan

00:49:59.03 play roulette he loses yeah but come on it's dan the universe

00:50:03.05 has a sense of humor [Laughter]

00:50:06.21 maybe he's like sub dog [ __ ] level as well god damn dude dan and I are on the

00:50:12.06 same level he just doesn't know it probably

00:50:15.12 he's he's also a universe's [ __ ] doormat oh this is this is a good I'm having

00:50:20.20 this is a fun episode do you think Geoff we should start recording in person

00:50:25.17 uh well how are we going to record with Andrew well I mean you and I could be in

00:50:29.09 person I mean yeah that would be fun but I feel like we'd it'd be an it'd be

00:50:34.00 like it wouldn't be balanced for Andrew I feel like we're all in the same

00:50:37.12 we're all in the same playing field when we're when we're alone but I feel like

00:50:40.19 the dynamic would be weird if you and I were in person but Andrew wasn't

00:50:43.20 you might be right I'm just really excited to do stuff in person

00:50:47.03 I don't know I'm not I'm not opposed to it you know it's like that's how we do

00:50:50.08 the break [ __ ]

00:50:51.12 stuff but how would you feel about it Andrew I think it would be a little

00:50:56.00 weird because the timing is just different

00:50:58.17 for you guys like it's more immediate like conversationally I think we're kind

00:51:02.08 of all equally in a delayed window which makes this work I mean I'm not not

00:51:05.18 opposed to trying I think we'd have to do it with headphones because

00:51:09.09 on the brake [ __ ] it's kind of hard to hear through the little speaker

00:51:12.21 I also don't know that you guys would have benefited

00:51:15.00 by me being in person in front of you last episode for instance

00:51:18.17 like you know well you weren't you were you're paying a bill

00:51:21.20 because you would have been literally not there

00:51:25.16 you know I'm gonna this is like we've recorded a bunch because people are

00:51:30.09 going on like summer breaks I'm gonna we're taking like a little

00:51:34.06 it's not gonna stop for the people we've got like six this episode

00:51:38.17 will come out on august 4th are you sorry yes

00:51:41.00 this is an august 4th episode you know what I feel worst about in that whole

00:51:44.10 deal is that the amount of time since we decided to record the

00:51:48.12 bike trick it's it's been a bit of time yeah like maybe a week but it's been

00:51:54.19 like six episodes yeah we should do that this week we

00:51:58.08 should do it this week but it's not gonna come out till

00:52:01.05 October at this point I think as long as we've got it in the bag

00:52:04.03 yeah yeah as long as we got in the bag I mean it's it to be fair to us too

00:52:07.14 every time we've tried there's been rain

00:52:09.20 and when you're dealing with when you're dealing with bad ass bike tricks and a

00:52:12.21 drainage [ __ ]

00:52:15.01 the ditch has got to be drained that's all there is to it

00:52:17.14 that is a great point yeah yeah I do see on the on the old weather map though

00:52:20.19 there's there's some sun peeking behind a cloud coming up really sweet

00:52:25.12 I uh well I'm I'm out of town next week uh

00:52:28.10 I'm not around next week but I am around today uh tomorrow and

00:52:32.11 and throughout the weekend so um we could try tomorrow

00:52:36.00 yeah before the icon is a cloud with lightning with a 90

00:52:39.01 chance [Laughter]

00:52:44.21 it's weird does not want me to pull off this badass bike trick

00:52:48.10 you know what though even if it's raining it would add an element in the

00:52:51.22 slow-mo that's true it would it would look

00:52:54.21 cooler you'd look like a very rad dude Geoff why don't we just do it tomorrow no

00:53:00.02 matter what well what is tomorrow Wednesday or

00:53:02.10 Thursday Friday tomorrow's Friday yeah well it's it's not it's the isn't

00:53:06.15 he worried about the landing that's the issue with the rain right is that why

00:53:10.13 I mean I'd have to go through listen if it's not a boat it's a bicycle so I

00:53:15.16 th the bike's not going to go through the raging river that is the drainage

00:53:20.22 if it's too wet uh yeah man I am a busy I have a thing from 10 to 11

00:53:25.08 but other than that I'm free so right after that I can uh maybe

00:53:28.10 I can head up maybe a little noon bike trip a little noon bike trip

00:53:32.13 I'll get the phantom ready all right I think I think that's all we need just a

00:53:58.21 ideal like perfect weather weather conditions once again

00:54:02.12 do you want to be mission control yeah I can't do the trick

00:54:07.01 if it's submerged sure that's totally fair just

00:54:10.17 in my head it doesn't like I in my head it's a puddle Geoff at the bottom of like

00:55:16.10 for me last year a lot of things didn't necessarily go the way I had planned

00:55:21.14 there were some pretty big obvious ones the main one I'd say

00:55:26.06 is the fire extinguisher the fire extinguisher bit did not go as planned

00:55:31.08 so I have a new fire extinguisher no way

00:55:34.01 I have a new fire extinguisher I have it bagged up just like last time

00:57:22.04 oh yeah it's all cont I don't know like I was I thought it was gonna fire

00:57:27.03 like a rocket was my concern so it's in like 15 garbage bags

00:57:31.11 I'm surprised I didn't rupture any of them I it may have

00:57:36.10 I don't know we'll find out I can start opening it I mean it's going

00:57:40.17 to take a while it's like a Russian doll scenario.

00:57:47.07 I love the way you do stuff you just start doing it there's no build up

00:57:51.12 there's no countdown you're just like yeah so I got a new fire.

00:57:57.11 I'm actually I'm not gonna I open one of these bags and I already I feel like

00:58:04.21 gonna put it back in that bag and we'll we'll

00:58:08.08 deal with that problem later but there we go

00:58:11.15 I feel fire extinguisher redeemed I hope you will document this in

00:58:19.20 take a photo of the bags and the and the unopening of it when I get there

00:58:23.11 I'll take a photo of the kettle as well I have some work to do maybe

00:58:27.12 with all this redemption happening there'll be roulette redemption maybe

00:58:32.08 this is it all of this stuff will turn your luck around

00:58:35.03 I could be it I bet if I picked a color for you now it would win

00:58:39.07 yeah do you want to do that right now yeah okay give me a second I'll I'll

00:58:42.22 log into my account nick can edit this so it won't be an awkward long pause

00:58:53.04 [Laughter]

00:58:54.10 Nick I'm glad you're back I miss nick it's great having nick back

00:59:00.06 do you have a gut instinct Gavin as far as what are you feeling right now what

00:59:04.07 is your process or is it just like in the moment you'll say

00:59:07.21 you'll know uh I know what I'm gonna say and I feel like I'll just say it to you

00:59:11.01 in a moment okay how much are you gonna are you thinking about putting

00:59:15.08 how much do you think I should uh well I'm gonna feel pretty responsible if you

00:59:21.07 lose so one dollar fifty fifty dollars that's a lot well I can't

00:59:25.07 remember what we were doing last time my bets with Geoff on the nba were ten

00:59:30.04 cent bets did you want me to come out roulette

00:59:32.07 I'll I'm willing to do 50 because of uh the energy of the 5000 guy

00:59:36.20 what what but last time you did roulette and I made you lose

00:59:42.06 what did you lose I think 20. Oh 20.

00:59:45.14 I think so yeah definitely not 50.50's uh that's a lot of ramen

00:59:49.11 that's a lot of ramen you should bet enough that if you

00:59:54.12 win you can replace the bowl you broke okay I gotta figure out inflation

01:00:00.06 I haven't seen a ball like that since the 80s I think it's that old um

01:00:06.15 what am I putting in what is the bet amount what are we doing is it 50 is 50

01:00:11.03 the the roulette bet what about a nice 25 so that you win 25

01:00:15.22 25 and you will do 25 we'll do 20

01:00:18.12 I sometimes do this anyway I call this a free lunch bet

01:00:19.14 if I win I get a free lunch I'll buy myself lunch don't have to think about

01:00:23.12 it if I lose I'm not gonna have a free lunch make

01:00:27.02 something okay we're authorizing deposit's successful okay we're going to

01:00:32.01 the live casino good lord hey trying to piss everybody off

01:00:38.10 okay should I share my screen can I do that yeah okay let's do that

01:00:44.17 oh yeah I see it okay so here we go so what are we doing

01:00:49.07 where are we going what's the bed Kevin black yep

01:00:53.04 oh [ __ ] I didn't mean to put it there okay there we go oh I was gonna say red

01:01:26.04 that's how we'll do it now you have a system we couldn't have the system before

01:01:31.22 I don't know why we just did that we already knew it wouldn't work

01:01:37.21 I said black I never went on black I maybe thought all the redemption would
