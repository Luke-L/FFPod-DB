00:00:26.13 [Music]

00:00:34.00 You think if maverick from top gun let's say tom

00:00:37.18 cruise right say if maverick from top gun walked by a school

00:00:42.04 and saw kids playing duck duck goose would that be traumatizing for him yes

00:00:47.06 yes yeah he would have like world war one PTSD where he yeah

00:00:51.16 he'd get tremors and [ __ ] I guess they call it gray duck in Minnesota or

00:00:56.16 something and says in a call they don't call it duck duck goose in Minnesota it's

00:01:02.02 like duck. Gray duck or something um what the [ __ ] and so I heard the word goose

00:01:06.02 said like 15 times in this conversation and it just my brain randomly went to

00:01:09.16 imagine if I was maverick and how traumatizing this conversation would be

00:01:13.17 for me right now just this quietly I'm deeply disturbed thinking about my best

00:01:17.11 friend's death when they're talking about a kids game what's that dude's

00:01:20.19 name Anthony Adams played uh uh Edwards I believe Anthony Edwards maybe

00:01:25.07 yeah I think so he was on er right after that or before yeah he was on uh he had

00:01:29.16 a conversation about this yesterday really yeah

00:01:33.01 me and Geoff we talked about this yesterday well I'm talking about goose

00:01:38.06 we talked about right those two actors and getting their names confused right

00:01:43.13 so he was he was also on northern exposure so you made almost the same

00:01:47.15 mistake I've made the same mistake but in reverse today I was talking about

00:01:51.00 Anthony Adams yesterday and called them Anthony Edwards and today's Anthony

00:01:55.03 Adams I don't think I know you're thinking now uh Anthony Anderson

00:01:59.14 Anthony Anderson is what I was thinking of yeah who's Anthony Adams

00:02:04.17 can I admit something to you wait a second

00:02:08.02 you got Anthony Adams doesn't exist no Anthony Adams is a former football

00:02:13.05 player okay what about jaisal nick Anthony jeselnik Anthony

00:02:16.09 are we naming anthony's I don't know dude it's all confusing uh I was

00:02:19.20 conflating Anthony Adams and Anthony Anderson while I was uh confusing that

00:02:24.21 person with Anthony Edwards uh can I make an

00:02:27.22 admission to you guys that is uh for a child born in the 70s who grew up in the

00:02:32.08 80s is kind of uh it's kind of it's been a cross to bear my whole life yeah what

00:02:38.01 I [ __ ] hate the movie top gun [Laughter]

00:02:40.14 I never liked it I never I saw it like on my friend's birthday we went to it

00:02:45.08 you know when it opened up and I was just like this I don't why do people

00:02:48.09 like I thought tom cruise was such a prick the entire film I liked goose and

00:02:53.16 then he died then the movie was over for me I never got him

00:02:56.15 it's I mean goose is definitely the heart of that movie I think that movie

00:03:00.04 sucks really thank you yeah I think it's don't think it sucks

00:03:03.18 dog [ __ ] it's not worth watching twice that's for sure yeah why does my

00:03:09.07 computer say it's snowing I don't know now oh it thinks I'm in uh wickson

00:03:15.07 Michigan what ah great have you been in wickson Michigan lately

00:03:19.12 I don't think so did I never set like oops

00:03:21.11 oh I was gonna I was gonna ask you guys to do something for me this and it

00:03:24.23 should not be hard it's I pretty much par for the course but could you guys do

00:03:28.13 your best not to make me laugh for the next time oh god

00:03:32.18 yeah that's pretty bad how did it go uh well uh you know I wanted to start off

00:03:38.13 2022 like I started off 2021

00:03:41.14 with root canals with your mouth yeah with my mouth open with some old guy

00:03:47.01 crawled up in it uh I yeah I got part one of my root canal

00:03:51.05 today on the first remember that first root canal I had way back a year and a

00:03:56.12 half ago that uh took five sessions wow

00:03:59.00 that pesky little guy uh guy got somehow got infected again and so uh I'm on

00:04:04.00 session six now on this tooth can you get your money back for the first five

00:04:09.14 no it doesn't work like that I don't think that's a dentist don't

00:04:13.02 have satisfaction guaranteed uh it's like an nfl contract they said they

00:04:18.00 they'll do their absolute best to eliminate the problem but it can come

00:04:21.13 back and it did so you know it's cool I got a root canal today and then I'll get

00:04:25.19 another one next week and then I'll be done is it seven and done or is it oh

00:04:30.19 it's it's either it's either uh he fixes it Wednesday or

00:04:34.23 we put or we pull the tooth so it's done one way or the other yeah I

00:04:39.09 would have been on pull the tooth after like four I think I don't think I'll

00:04:44.08 grow seven and pull the problem is I like the teeth that I have you know

00:04:48.19 and I'm also I've also invested a lot of money in this tooth specifically yeah

00:04:53.03 you know what I mean yeah it's a sunken cost fallacy I guess but I

00:04:56.12 just I really I really feel like keeping the tooth

00:04:59.12 around to get my money's worth out of it

00:05:01.17 it's this weird almost like investing in a car that you just need to let go of

00:05:05.15 like you've got so much money into it but seven is your walk away seven's a

00:05:09.15 lucky number Geoff yeah number seven that'll be it that'll be the turnaround

00:05:14.00 for you just need seven and then you'll be fine are you at more root canals on

00:05:19.01 that tooth than transformer movies I think you're tied definitely

00:05:22.04 okay I think once you go past fast and furious movies that's when you pull the

00:05:27.09 tooth yeah like right now I I'm still in the king arthur's court uh level of

00:05:32.03 transformers I think but if if I get to Jason statham uh getting

00:05:36.18 into a fist fight while holding a baby on an airplane then although it's time

00:05:40.17 to pull the two it's the best part of that movie by a

00:05:43.12 lot I know that's true it's definitely the best easily the best best sequence

00:05:47.00 are we counting hobbs and shot in the yes okay so you got you got a few to go

00:05:51.11 still before you cross that line imagine if we were to count movies in which

00:05:56.00 Jason statham drives cars and that's his thing get the transporter

00:06:00.14 is this pleasantries or is this the episode oh I think we've been in the

00:06:04.13 episode for a while did an intro did we not no no no I can do one right now uh

00:06:08.09 hello and welcome to the uh march 16th edition of the F**kFuckFacePodcast I say that

00:06:13.12 because when I came in for pleasantries Eric said this this episode will air

00:06:16.23 march 16th but nobody said what number it is so I don't know I know we're in

00:06:20.15 season four what number 94 it's 94. Episode episode 94 of season four year

00:06:27.20 two still are we still in year two uh yeah yeah

00:06:31.20 yeah yeah so we're still in year two season four episode 94 of the face

00:06:37.09 podcast uh for reference it was recorded on February 172022 for airing on march

00:06:42.15 162022 I have no idea why I uh included

00:06:46.11 all that especially considering how much it hurts to talk Eric asks what did

00:06:51.19 Andrew think the intro was I just couldn't remember if it happened or not

00:06:56.17 like we we switched so many topics we moved into the tooth I saw the message

00:07:00.11 Eric messaged like at the beginning do the intro and then I just couldn't

00:07:04.01 remember if that actually happened I I just had no memory I had no no

00:07:07.09 recollection of it but we did it now definitively and while we're talking

00:07:11.22 about bad movies I feel like I should bring up a certain movie that I find mvp

00:07:16.04 no that's a great matrix matrix thank you Geoff yeah I watched the I watched

00:07:21.07 the most recent matrix movie which has been a point of contention uh what's it

00:07:26.13 called resurrection I think so I think it's the matrix resurrections

00:07:31.07 resurrection something like that but I I hadn't seen it and I largely had been

00:07:35.20 avoiding seeing it because after Gavin watched it he asked if I if I'd seen it

00:07:40.16 I said no and he said well if you like that movie we would cease to be friends

00:07:44.23 and I would stop doing this show that is how much I hate this I don't think I've

00:07:48.17 ever heard it yeah extreme every time no it was it was that's been the bar you

00:07:53.13 you've hated I've never heard you hate anything like you've hated that movie oh

00:07:58.05 I'm not denying that I hate that movie I was just surprised at how many people I

00:08:01.10 spoke to about it liked it so I was like oh which one which one will Andrew be

00:08:05.09 why because I texted you before you saw it asking if you had and you said no and

00:08:09.14 I said it's interesting it's very divisive people seem to either

00:08:12.16 absolutely love it or hate it there doesn't really seem to be much a middle

00:08:16.21 for most people and then like two days later you saw it and you were like

00:08:21.12 violently hated it like the most aggressively hated anything oh yeah dog [ __ ]

00:08:27.03 so what were your thoughts I think it might be and

00:08:30.21 there's a big caveat with this I think it's my favorite matrix movie

00:08:35.15 of all of them [Laughter]

00:08:39.16 I can't tell you how happy I am to hear you say that

00:08:43.16 David just dropped from our call he left he's back all right I couldn't

00:08:48.22 figure out what to leave for let me was that enough yeah that was good

00:08:53.13 I think really well time let me just clarify a few things I didn't love the

00:08:57.02 first movie I feel like I kind of missed

00:09:00.02 out on that being like super cool I just I saw it late

00:09:02.18 and uh it was fine I saw the two and three in theaters didn't like them at

00:09:06.07 all I just thought they were boring as a kid so I don't have a fandom for any of

00:09:10.23 these movies okay and you're completely correct in

00:09:14.12 saying that like this most recent matrix movie is super stupid it's really dumb

00:09:19.11 it's ridiculous but I just didn't care about the feel

00:09:22.08 it feels super low budget it's like the most expensive one ever but it just

00:09:25.18 feels it looks so cheap looking I don't know why

00:09:28.16 there is definitely a visual aesthetic and also I feel like that movie is

00:09:32.00 designed to be a thing you hate more than anything I've ever seen like with a

00:09:36.12 lot of the choices in it as far as how meta it is

00:09:39.09 and uh it's just yeah I loved it loved it maybe it's a strong word I really

00:09:44.12 enjoyed it I was like wow that wasn't bad at all I feel bad that I I like this

00:09:48.17 I wish we could be a line I enjoyed it to the point where I was still thinking

00:09:51.21 about it a few days later I was like you know what that was really that was fine

00:09:55.18 yeah I was thinking about it too.

00:09:58.13 I gotta say it looks good yeah it's like really dumb and there's a lot of cringy

00:10:03.22 things in it but the things that are cringy I feel like are by design

00:10:07.12 like it's it's like fan service type [ __ ] uh some of the fan service stuff as

00:10:11.16 well as some of the dialogue choices like there's this really obnoxious like

00:10:17.03 gamer guy that's like milf alert and it's like super [ __ ] cringy but it

00:10:21.02 feels like that's what that character is like I don't like he's just

00:10:25.05 a man yeah like that that unfortunately is a person that exists and they're in

00:10:29.12 the movie and it's not enjoyable but it's not like that they're accurately

00:10:33.09 portraying that person do you hate lines such as I still know

00:10:37.12 kung fu that wasn't as upsetting to me as the way like it's the way that you

00:10:42.18 said it was like he [ __ ] juggled and like winked at the camera six times and

00:10:47.07 it just sort of is a passing moment I was kind of disappointed by how not like

00:10:51.01 he's on the nose but I was expecting a whole of the other level or the the

00:10:54.14 maravincian talking about Facebook and mark Zuckerberg and stuff I mean that

00:10:58.01 stuff just was like whatever they entered a weird that's in the world

00:11:01.01 beginning the meta stuff of it is just strange where they go into that it's

00:11:04.05 like a video game and just the approach of like the start of that story is so

00:11:09.16 self-referential Gavin do you maybe hate the movie a

00:11:13.13 little bit because you're old I don't a lot of people don't know this uh who

00:11:17.12 haven't known you forever but your first aim name that we used to communicate

00:11:20.15 with was milf alert do you feel comforted.

00:11:26.10 I wished so much that that was fun

00:11:33.07 that's great that's a great day I would love to just see a chat log between like

00:11:39.03 a press conference where it's a chat log between both alert and delicious boner

00:11:43.23 what a great great combination have I ever told you the story about me and

00:11:48.12 bernie's first wife and delicious boner no

00:11:51.10 no it's a great combination of work I was at work uh what andrew's referring

00:11:55.13 to is my old aim name we used to all communicate through aim aol instant

00:11:59.00 messenger a ton back in the day that was like our preferred method of communique

00:12:04.15 and uh my my uh my aim name was delicious boner it wasn't my first

00:12:09.07 I had to get rid of one because it leaked out and then too many community

00:12:13.06 members were messaging me and then I had one that was set sail for ass which I

00:12:17.05 thought was pretty funny uh and then eventually I landed on

00:12:20.09 delicious boner I think my balls your your ass my ball's your ass listen yeah

00:12:24.17 I changed I had to change name names a lot they kept getting out so anyway

00:12:28.04 delicious boner was my favorite and uh Bernie was in Virginia visiting his dad

00:12:33.03 and uh he called me and he said hey I'm trying to teach my dad how to use

00:12:37.21 instant messenger can I can I give you a call real fast

00:12:40.19 and I'm like yeah of course and then I get a like you know message from Bernie

00:12:44.19 burns and I go hello and then I hear his wife I hear it pop

00:12:48.20 up and I hear his wife at the time go oh no

00:12:53.03 and I realized it was Bernie and his dad their whole family around the computer

00:12:58.04 looking at looking at a message from delicious boner.

00:13:03.14 I think that was the longest lasting aim name you had yeah I had it for a very

00:13:08.00 long time yeah I forgot about some of those you mentioned like my balls your

00:13:11.14 ass that one wasn't as I was uh I was Vaughn

00:13:14.21 evil Satan for a while yeah we had to change a names a lot back in the day

00:13:19.03 that was the whole thing um evil Satan I don't even remember why it was a

00:13:24.08 inside baseball rooster teeth joke I don't I

00:13:27.15 don't remember where it came from or why

00:13:30.12 I uh I've been watching this mtv reality show from 2005 and it's been great

00:13:35.09 mainly for the t-shirt choices of that time period as well as the prizes that

00:13:39.20 these people are winning and one of the prizes they won was the first smart shoe

00:13:44.12 called verb for shoe it was like this is the first shoe that has the computer

00:13:48.18 chip in it it will inflate and deflate based off of your pressure we will send

00:13:52.19 you emails if it needs repair like it was this insane thing and I was like

00:13:56.04 I've never [ __ ] heard of verb for shoe like what happened almost all the

00:13:59.12 prizes that were like wacky gadgets never actually existed including verb

00:14:03.12 for shoe but in my research of it it was invented by a guy named Ronald demon

00:14:07.13 which made me really laugh just reading like mr demon went like it's just such a

00:14:11.16 great casual like fake sounding like if a demon was going to inhabit the earth

00:14:16.00 like that'd be the shitty name they'd come up with like ah Ronald demon so it

00:14:21.11 just failed or it like never was it like they did like series of pre-orders for

00:14:25.06 it from like 2004 then 2008 and then I just haven't found a single

00:14:29.23 trace of it actually being manufactured or existing in any way

00:14:34.00 but just like that uniform pick up the reins yeah maybe

00:14:37.19 he's probably not with balloons [ __ ]

00:14:39.20 beach in the Caribbean somewhere spinning all that investment uh

00:14:43.15 hey I don't I don't want to talk today much but uh okay I realize after saying

00:14:47.15 that I have three time sensitive things that we have to go over because we're

00:14:51.18 already it's already march 16th for christ's sake uh

00:14:55.00 so at some point today I just before we end I need to crowbar these things in so

00:14:58.22 anyway continue no crowbar crowbar away I feel like it's out why don't you okay

00:15:03.12 there is uh I don't think it's happened yet but it

00:15:06.12 may have but if it did then you saw it but if it hasn't you should check it out

00:15:11.07 uh we're testing out I wanna do I've long wanted to do uh

00:15:15.18 I've always wanted the lamest jobs in television like I always wanted to be

00:15:19.13 Todd bridges but not in different strokes I wanted to be Todd bridges on

00:15:23.09 like world's worst disasters and like sure

00:15:26.03 america's worst criminals where you just get to sit there and make one lame

00:15:29.03 [ __ ] joke that somebody else writes for you and then you're like can I have

00:15:32.15 my two thousand dollars you know uh but I've also really wanted to be uh and

00:15:36.16 I think we've talked about this before in the past maybe not on camera but I

00:15:40.00 always really wanted to be one of those knife guys who's on at like three in the

00:15:43.13 morning on local television doing like it's like it's like the redneck version

00:15:47.12 of qvc where it's just like two old dudes with belt buckles and like a white

00:15:51.21 lazy Susan and they just throw like a Rambo knife on it and then they talk

00:15:54.22 about it for three minutes and it spins around and they sell it like you know

00:15:58.06 and then they put on another knife and like there's a buck hunting knife and

00:15:59.11 then uh oh yeah there they are right there I want to be the dude on the left

00:16:04.10 that's [ __ I great we'll put that in the episode uh

00:16:07.21 doing a terrible job so far thank you uh and so I have a bunch of like remnant

00:16:12.08 merchandise for like the Geoff line if you're not a mm-hmm if you're just a

00:16:15.20 regulation listener and you don't participate in the rest oh hello Henry

00:16:22.08 line it's been around for a couple years and so I have a bunch of crap that

00:16:25.09 didn't sell and I thought like let me sell it like qvc style like live sale it

00:16:28.12 would be like a fun like infomercial kind of thing uh and so they we set that

00:16:32.18 up and it may have already happened but it hasn't already happened I'm very

00:16:36.10 excited to announce to you two because I think this is very funny they told me I

00:16:39.18 had to come up with a name and then they gave me a list of potential names like

00:16:47.14 and I came up with everything must go go now

00:18:02.00 topless and which segways into the number two thing uh this is now this

00:18:06.11 joke's now over a month old but uh we in in our time the time that we're

00:18:11.00 recording this last week we recorded a face break [ __ ]

00:18:14.09 and uh you know Gavin you couldn't be there because of prior obligations so uh

00:18:18.13 it was me and Eric and uh Andrew and Emily as always uh and uh we debuted

00:18:23.14 some of the some of the sounds on the sound board that was pretty exciting uh

00:18:27.07 gavin's oh no was on there uh but right before there the reason we

00:18:32.05 recorded it in the old location and not the new location is because I had to

00:18:36.01 make a video for achievement with jack for the super bowl and so they were like

00:18:39.12 well let's just move our production over here to make it easier on achievement

00:18:42.19 hunter and jack which we did and then jack was supposed to jump on finally

00:18:46.12 jump on the brake show uh right after that uh because they too butted up

00:18:49.19 against each other and I turned around and that [ __ ] was in his car

00:18:53.12 driving away I couldn't believe it he was even in the

00:18:57.10 description for the break show I looked the social the [ __ ] marketing team

00:19:02.03 even advertised it as jack being in there and the guy and the son of a [ __ ]

00:19:07.07 took off he Matt damond me or like a reverse Matt Damon uh and uh and so I

00:19:12.03 got so annoyed I took that photo of him that I have

00:19:15.14 taped to the side of the bin that I bring the the baseball cards in the one

00:19:19.08 that he made he made it of himself it's like jack with a big ass like Louis ck

00:19:23.23 bald head because he was uh he made up for a contest or something years ago

00:19:28.23 so I put it on a [ __ I shirt and we sold it

00:19:31.13 and I I said we would sell it until he finds out about it and then so all I did

00:19:35.13 was post on Instagram an Instagram story

00:19:37.15 on the face account just don't tell jack

00:19:39.12 but if you have any interest in this you can get it if not I don't give a [ __ ]

00:19:43.05 don't buy it I'm not trying to get you to but I'm just telling it's available

00:19:46.10 right and uh it managed to be up from Friday to Monday before he noticed

00:19:51.10 and we sold hundreds of them how how did he notice how did he did he find

00:19:55.22 out himself do you know how it was discovered I don't know I just got a I

00:19:59.09 just got a text from him and it's like it just said like somebody told me

00:20:04.02 all right so I took it down but it wasn't I was even thinking

00:20:08.04 I should create like well I don't I can't say it on the podcast because

00:20:13.03 he'll hear it uh let me just say I'm not done

00:20:15.00 and I hope jack pisses me off again because I have other I have other ideas

00:20:18.21 and I'm talking to you regulation listeners and I'm talking to you comment

00:20:22.06 leavers I don't know how to get this information to you because he listens to

00:20:26.13 this [ __ ] podcast he's a is a big ass fan so uh

00:20:29.08 I'll find some other way to communicate with you because the next time he steps

00:20:33.10 over the line I've got I've got plans to

00:20:35.19 put in place it's going to be one I just love the idea of stuff being on sale

00:20:40.23 depending on how much you happen to like jack

00:20:43.19 yeah that's pretty much it is it just this thing now that you just will never

00:20:47.18 be on it uh I don't know dude he's I mean I think he was dodging obligation

00:20:52.00 and work you know he was like wow that's

00:20:54.15 the that's what I'm paid to do from nine to five so uh [ __ ] them

00:20:59.08 uh anyway that was the second thing and then the third thing uh is Andrew you

00:21:03.15 sent me a troubling tweet the other day and I'd like to I'd like to know why oh

00:21:08.17 you want to talk about yeah you tweeted to me and you said only I consider this

00:21:13.08 a declaration of war well I'll post it in so I got Geoff mailed me a thing out

00:21:18.20 of the kindness of his heart apparently I thought this was

00:21:22.20 I didn't know how to interpret it at first I didn't know what was coming it

00:21:27.20 was in a giant bag it was very Santa-like it doesn't look that big in the photo

00:21:33.11 oh it's huge it's [ __ ]

00:21:35.20 massive it's like a sack it is genuinely like a Santa sack sized bag and I was

00:21:39.12 like oh Geoff is so Geoff is so sweet he sent a thing he sent a card I don't have

00:21:43.07 a photo of that but it was like something it was it was a nice little

00:21:46.10 message it was during when I was at the peak of like issues with uh my my ankle

00:21:51.15 uh and then so I opened the sack which took a long

00:21:55.03 time I didn't I didn't tell you this it took me genuinely like three minutes to

00:22:00.13 undo the ribbons on this [ __ ] sack because it was like quadruple knotted on

00:22:04.04 both sides and I'd like loosen one side and then the other side would get

00:22:09.05 tighter and it was a nightmare so I finally it is so I finally I open the

00:22:14.10 sack and then I have this I have this small box in this giant [ __ ] bag

00:22:18.15 and I'm like what is this now it's a box this is like it's still kind of like

00:22:22.13 exciting what could it possibly be so then I finally opened the box and you

00:22:28.08 just sent me a giant [ __ ] thing a bubble wrap to I guess protect my foot

00:22:32.11 yes wrap my foot in here's the thing let me explain let me explain not to

00:22:35.23 wrap your foot although you reserve the right to do that uh here's the thing uh

00:22:40.18 you and Gavin at the at the same time were both having problems in your lives

00:22:44.07 and I've I've addressed both of them uh Gavin you don't know this yet no I I

00:22:49.07 I've got the package oh you got the mail okay

00:22:52.00 I stepped over on the way in today so uh Gavin you had a particular issue

00:22:56.16 god damn it Henry you had a particular issue

00:22:59.12 and Andrew you had a particular issue and I I thought like let me put my

00:23:03.05 uniform hat on and let me invent some ways to help you and I'll be honest I'm

00:23:07.13 just a little down on ideas right now I'm not feeling super creative and I

00:23:11.01 thought I bet I bet solutions exist let me be creative with those so Andrew I

00:23:15.11 worry about you falling a lot you and my great-grandma I worry well she's dead

00:23:19.22 but my grandma you and my grandma I worry about falling constantly and so

00:23:26.00 for you I bought you 125 feet of bubble wrap that you can bubble wrap

00:23:29.09 every hard or sharp edge in your apartment and then if there's enough left over

00:23:34.10 wrap it around your ankle or lay it on the floor so when you fall you fall into

00:23:38.02 a cushion because it's kind of a given that you will fall again I would I'm

00:23:42.08 just waiting for the time that you fall and impale your neck on a sharp corner

00:23:45.20 or something so I wanna I know or you have to bite me to the hospital isn't

00:23:50.19 that what happened yeah yeah right I did I biked him home and

00:23:54.19 then his parents took my hospital uh I uh I want

00:23:57.12 desperately to keep you safe and so I want to Andrew proof your apartment uh I

00:24:02.13 also sent you a got returned so I apologize for this I can resend it if

00:24:07.03 you'd like I bought you like eight uh like eight

00:24:09.23 k uh like spools of I don't know what you call it of packing tape so uh I've

00:24:14.13 got a shitload of packing tape but I guess for some reason amazon couldn't

00:24:18.02 deliver your packing tape you were stuttering there like you couldn't get

00:24:21.07 through that sentence but Henry was also

00:24:22.23 squeezing at the same time every time so it sounded like a skipped record I was

00:24:27.09 searching for a word Henry was distracting me and the pain is intense

00:24:31.03 in my mouth they didn't have the pain they had my

00:24:34.04 antibiotics ready at the at the pharmacy but not the pain meds oh I haven't

00:24:37.22 gotten them yet well you can keep the tape

00:24:39.21 it's okay it's very kind to you though yeah that way uh just so like just just

00:24:44.10 wrap everything in three layers of bubble tape or bubble wrap and you're

00:24:47.20 gonna be fine awesome shall I post a picture of what

00:24:50.10 you sent me yeah I'd love to see what you say

00:24:53.06 I don't even what is that yeah what is that that's not all I sent you either no

00:24:58.02 he said he also sent me a cucumber which was lovely um mostly mostly new it's

00:25:04.04 only partially used a cucumber with like a third of it

00:25:08.23 missing or like maybe a quarter cup um and this from what I can tell is a

00:25:12.22 device that you put over the top of a doorknob with and it grips it to make it

00:25:18.02 like a door handle yes yes I got you and it's portable

00:25:21.20 it's like it's like throw it in your pocket and then whenever you are out

00:25:26.15 about around town or in a different country and you encounter something as

00:25:31.12 offensive to you as a doorknob you can pull that puppy out slap it on and uh

00:25:37.03 and all your fears and hatred and anger will melt away in the hands of a strong

00:25:41.05 plastic or rubber I guess rubber strong rubberized uh door handle yeah it's

00:25:46.03 amazing I don't have any doorknobs to test it on um as we've

00:25:49.15 established and obviously they're illegal in Vancouver so yeah probably

00:25:53.12 won't be using them there but I'm gonna keep one in my pocket yeah you travel a

00:25:56.23 lot yeah that's such a great I didn't know that was the thing that was very

00:26:00.19 kind and you know what no kindness should should go

00:26:03.08 without return Geoff so I hope you know that I we can't at least I can't I won't

00:26:07.19 speak for Gavin I can't wait to return the favor to you and make sure that you

00:26:11.14 also just understand how much I appreciated the bubble wrap and but do

00:26:15.16 something right one one could argue that you already uh showed me that level of

00:26:20.15 affection with a port a potty a year ago and this is me making up uh for that

00:26:25.11 there's no need there's no need no yeah this was this is a different year it

00:26:29.06 doesn't it's a year thing it changed years so I think it's this is a

00:26:32.21 different gift I have to return the favor to you

00:26:36.18 and uh I you know it's I appreciate your

00:26:39.01 kindness and I can assure you it will be equally matched and I hope you enjoy

00:26:43.14 whatever that happens you got to make sure it's a good gift

00:26:48.23 that could be a good one we'll see it has to be sweet it'll be a

00:26:53.01 sweet thoughtful thing that Geoff loves and uh I can't wait can't wait to return

00:26:58.13 the kindness [Laughter]

00:27:00.23 I really you shouldn't you don't have to no I can't wait to do it it's gonna be

00:27:06.09 great

00:27:11.05 is being able to send someone else a gift in return the giving is the joy

00:27:17.05 so the best part part for you is receiving the receiving

00:27:22.04 no the best part for me is returning you're a receiver Andrew you're you're

00:27:27.04 like a natural giver you're one who receives

00:27:30.13 uh you one who collects who who yes uh he takes in it takes into your arms

00:27:36.15 whereas I am I'm one who pushes and shoves at you

00:27:39.20 I wish I I could remember who said this and give them the credit somebody

00:27:44.13 reached out to me and they brought up that I am a stormer because I stormed

00:27:48.20 out of my room when you bought all the [ __ ] at my birthday that I had to just

00:27:53.14 keep going there's a documented storm of me on this

00:27:57.02 show so I guess I am a stormer I have storms there you go but you were you

00:28:00.19 weren't storming out you were storming towards something yeah we're storming in

00:28:06.19 I'm I'm an aggressive storm I guess I go

00:28:06.19 after I'm not away I pursue I I was uh I

00:28:09.20 was reading the comments on the one that just came out and um the audience

00:28:15.05 pointed out something based on this part of the conversation does

00:28:19.20 randy savage begin or where does you know what I mean and macho man

00:28:24.14 end like is there like how different is he at home on right now in his living

00:28:29.14 room watching cnn yeah did you know he's been dead for over a decade

00:28:36.23 I'll I'll say this the producer of this show [ __ ] knew I guarantee you

00:28:44.23 yeah I I knew and we talked about it and

00:28:48.12 I thought you were making a joke I think if you were to listen to my audio you

00:28:54.02 say that and then I probably go what and laugh but it's not in this

00:28:59.20 episode gonna find that because it was you it's saying

00:29:03.12 watching cnn right like at his house right now right now like

00:29:07.23 right now all of those I I didn't know he was dead I wasn't

00:29:12.15 or if I knew he was dead I forgot about it but I think the point of the of the

00:29:17.11 uh the point I was trying to make still stands was

00:29:19.23 all right rest in peace randy savage I'm so sorry to hear you miss Elizabeth and

00:29:24.07 I uh both I'm sure are crestfallen uh I think she's dead too

00:29:28.15 are you I'm pretty sure she's the I'm pretty sure yeah

00:29:31.08 way longer yes I think he died way longer than he did what about the snake

00:29:35.14 is the snake alive Jake the snake is still good Jake the snake is alive

00:29:40.02 Damien the snake was not actually one snake there were a bunch of different

00:29:43.14 snakes and most are dead yes oh man all right well anyway rest in peace macho

00:29:48.05 man randy savage who I'm not gonna ask there's so many other people I don't

00:29:51.07 know if they're dead now but I guess they are I guess if I can name a name

00:29:54.23 that I remember from the 80s associated with wrestling there could you could you

00:29:58.12 just name one name for me please Jess Manny Fernandez the flying burrito

00:30:02.06 thank you that's the thing my favorite wrestler when I was a kid growing up

00:30:03.14 followed closely by dusty rhodes and then by the road warriors and then when

00:30:08.04 they hooked up and it became the legion of doom that was like it would have been

00:30:11.17 one of my first bonuses so many things yeah I mean like I'm pretty sure Manny

00:30:16.23 Fernandez is still alive and I just I remember him as the raging bull um

00:30:22.03 like nwa or whatever yeah one half of the road warriors is dead so who died

00:30:27.12 hawk or animal uh hawk animal's still alive I think oh that's son it's that's

00:30:32.04 sad maybe maybe he did die not too long ago

00:30:35.13 hawk was the smart one the animal was the angrier one yeah he was more rage oh

00:30:40.04 no yeah in 2020 animal died so the [ __ ] has been

00:30:44.12 yeah they're both dead [ __ ] hell dude yeah

00:30:47.11 anyway I still think the point still stands is that I was trying to get to is

00:30:52.19 is was randy savage the macho man at home when he was kicking up his feet

00:30:56.16 drinking a beer and watching tv or was it a persona he put on right yeah

00:31:01.09 I just wonder where like the character ends and begins I apologize I wasn't up

00:31:06.07 on my sl on my dead celebrities but uh I'll just go ahead and say this

00:31:11.18 if if we talk about a wrestler chances are they're dead yeah

00:31:14.17 that's fair especially from that era yeah the high probability for sure yeah

00:31:18.22 I don't think your point was wrong I think your point is completely valid it

00:31:22.12 was just the phrasing was definitely odd for sure I I think at the time I

00:31:26.06 registered as I thought well he's dead but it didn't you know like it didn't

00:31:29.05 register enough I understood what you were saying so I didn't feel the need to

00:31:32.10 be correct also he's he's a mortal as he lives on

00:31:36.23 through his music that is true.

00:31:39.11 [Applause]

00:31:42.12 A lot of people didn't even bother making resolutions this year and you

00:31:47.02 know what I get it but it doesn't mean you shouldn't still find a way to shake

00:31:50.22 things up whether it's by switching your workout routine or going someplace new

00:34:59.09 minute I had please I had quite the uh quite the story we're going to go on a

00:35:04.19 journey we're going to start it's going to seem

00:35:07.15 we're going to get to a weird place but it's needed for the context because

00:35:12.10 I think it adds to the story so like last week

00:35:15.02 one year it was the the one year since my grandma had passed and so I was like

00:35:18.23 spending time with my mom for dinner it's her mom my grandma very close and

00:35:23.01 we're having this like emotional dinner we lit a candle we're talking about

00:35:26.23 things and then the conversation kind of pivoted and she my mom loves like

00:35:31.19 watching shows and whatnot she is a very

00:35:33.20 like she doesn't curse she grew up super religious like a Martha Stewart type

00:35:37.20 person um so we're talking she's like yeah I've

00:35:41.16 been watching uh this thing on Netflix or I don't remember what was on I think

00:35:46.12 bj novak is in it and uh it was the the guy that was on lost and Hawaii 5-0 and

00:35:51.18 I was like lock and she's like no so Hurley no I was like jin yeah Daniel hit

00:35:57.07 him that's who it was yeah Daniel day kim and bj bj novak have their show uh

00:36:02.14 are butt plugs real that was the pivot that was the pit that is how it went I

00:36:07.20 was stunned just immediate into our butt plugs real

00:36:11.14 and the camera was still lit like it remembered

00:36:16.01 the candle was still lit in remembrance and she my mom doesn't curse she's like

00:36:21.04 very like not at all like very conservative she's a very liberal in her

00:36:26.19 beliefs but a very conservative social person are butt plugs real

00:36:31.14 have you heard of a butt plug and I'm just I'm

00:36:35.03 [ __ ] stunned that this has just happened

00:36:37.19 so then I'm like yeah but but plugs are yeah they're real but plugs are real and

00:36:41.21 she's like okay yeah she explained that I guess the plot of the episode of the

00:36:45.22 show involved butt plugs and she had never heard of a butt plug and she

00:36:49.20 thought that they were a fictional creation

00:36:51.20 for that show she didn't know that they were real so then she had to turn to her

00:36:56.02 son for clarification she had to turn to me on the anniversary of her mom's

00:37:00.21 passing right after we had this very serious time so then

00:37:05.10 so then time passes a little bit and then she says to me should I Google

00:37:10.12 it or should you just tell me I said what are you talking about she

00:37:15.02 said well like why do people why would you have a butt plug should I Google it

00:37:20.10 or are you gonna tell me oh and I said I can tell you but you didn't

00:37:24.20 ask like what they did or what they were

00:37:26.23 but you asked are they real and I I know they exist she's clearly wanted to know

00:37:30.20 when she when she asked if they were real why didn't you just fill her in on no

00:37:35.14 listen I the context of when it happened and

00:37:38.16 everything like I'm stunned it's just an insane this is like I've never had a

00:37:44.00 conversation like this with my mom and we're going deep on butt plugs

00:37:48.23 and so then I explained her well [Laughter]

00:37:51.23 I I say like well I don't necess I haven't really looked at butt plugs in

00:37:56.09 depth but I think from my understanding some people find pleasure in them and

00:38:01.12 then there might be like a way to like practice or train towards

00:38:05.01 anal sex I don't really know necessarily

00:38:07.16 but I believe those are like the leading reasons why you may want a butt plugger

00:38:13.03 where we're a butt plug so then I'm just imagining her at your

00:38:17.14 wedding one day and she's like what about dildos [Laughter]

00:38:22.04 so then I explained that and there's a pause and like I can see her processing

00:38:27.20 and then she says what's more known a butt plug or a brony out of [ __ ] left

00:38:32.19 field because she had just learned she just learned that bronies exist like

00:38:37.11 two days prior uh and I really struggled to answer that

00:38:41.12 question oh definitely butt plug I would

00:38:45.11 assume oh I feel like thousands of years bronyism was a fad yeah like a decade

00:38:49.15 ago flash in the thing really I was more

00:38:51.20 I didn't know because I feel like it was so big but maybe it's just because I

00:38:55.14 knew people that were super into it so my perception of how popular my little

00:39:00.00 pony and bronies were I'll say this are you are those people still bronies

00:39:04.11 are they still way into it no absolutely well I tell you what once a butt plug

00:39:10.02 fan probably always about I don't think you age out of those

00:39:13.23 so we go through that and then my mom was just like uh things are so

00:39:17.10 sexualized nowadays or something like that and I was like well I think butt

00:39:20.17 plugs have probably been around like an insanely long amount of time if I looked

00:39:26.02 into it so I searched it and the first butt plug was made in like 1897 they

00:39:30.01 were called anal dilators and the guy that sold them were like this will cure

00:39:34.10 everything you got night blindness you need higher iq shove one up you'll be

00:39:38.12 good you got this you're gonna be fine and he did that unchecked for like 30

00:39:42.10 years until like the fda looked at how he was

00:39:45.16 marketing them and was like you cannot do this

00:39:49.02 this is illegal you have to stop selling these yeah but people have been surely

00:39:53.03 shoving shut up their ass for centuries can you imagine that the conversation

00:39:56.22 you're like how did you meet somebody and you're like had your so you're well

00:39:59.22 off how'd your family get your fortune uh I really don't want to tell you but

00:40:04.23 it had to do with my great grandfather had to do with night blindness

00:40:10.10 he was a doctor of sorts so this is there's another plug I'm just like I'm

00:40:14.00 stunned I'm lost that like we are we are like knee-deep in ass plug talk on this

00:40:19.04 anniversary you keep you're you're you're euphemisms man

00:40:23.07 you're knee-deep in ass talk you gotta stop god damn

00:40:28.12 she pop like there's another pause and she looks at me and she says wow

00:40:33.01 at least I have something to talk about my friend at lunch tomorrow I wonder if

00:40:36.20 they've heard about plugs and it's like she's going out for like a coffee with

00:40:41.02 like her other 60 year old friend do you think she's one of the oldest

00:40:46.08 people to discover the butt plug alive today yeah or is she like breaking news

00:40:51.14 to all of her friends and they're like let's see what now I don't I

00:40:55.20 that would be a great thing to discover can I request uh some information

00:40:59.22 absolutely at a future date can you check back in with your mom and find out

00:41:03.16 if her friends knew what butt plugs and if she's like the last one to the table

00:41:09.18 just hey let me finish okay I'm going to get there I didn't realize that

00:41:15.03 no we're still going to be are we first climax

00:41:18.20 so she pulls out her phone after this after like I explain

00:41:22.23 because I like showed her what the original butt plugs look like uh

00:41:27.08 and then so she pulls at her phone to like clearly search them and she

00:41:31.03 whispers like she's even like embarrassed to say it out loud she's

00:41:34.09 like is is butt plug spelled with one tee or two

00:41:37.18 like she didn't know if it was butt plug or literal butt plug

00:41:43.09 so I had to clarify that and then I was just like don't [ __ ] you

00:41:48.05 know don't search I'll pull it up like it's going to be a [ __ ] I've already

00:41:52.02 got a book if you search for this so I pull it up and I show a photo of it

00:41:57.07 and she looked at it and she's immediately like 15 those are low

00:42:02.00 quality it's a three pack like what this is a [ __ ] like she's immediately

00:42:06.09 critiquing the quality of it and deemed them to be like shitty and that there

00:42:11.12 better be she was like are there titanium ones like what are the high end

00:42:15.07 for buttplugs

00:42:19.12 she thought they were pieces of [ __ ]

00:42:22.03 that were cheap and she likes fancy extravagant things so she's like what's

00:42:25.19 the high end of this or do they come in titanium so now I'm on like just a sex

00:42:30.05 like a random sex store site pulling up butt plugs I find the most expensive one

00:42:34.16 is like 160 dollars was it like a Chanel collaboration or something

00:42:39.03 Gucci it was a Gucci bump Chanel x an a la

00:42:45.20 it was remote operated and she just she wasn't pressed because

00:42:50.11 it was a titanium she's like yeah [ __ ]

00:42:52.10 out I don't care it's not titanium so then I showed her one that made it look

00:42:56.02 like you had a tail and she was done that was it we were done she had no that

00:43:00.13 killed it that was a bridge too far you're not allowed to have a tail so

00:43:05.05 that was the limits of your mom yeah yeah we've

00:43:08.21 we hit the peak of it so I talked to her today and I I asked I asked jokingly

00:43:15.11 because she had had she's been to like four different lunches or whatever since

00:43:21.09 we've had this talk so I asked her I asked like just as I said as a joke so

00:43:26.10 did you talk to your friends if they knew what butt plugs were

00:43:29.10 and she said like completely seriously yes I'm doing a survey and then she went

00:43:34.06 through her list she has asked every time she is like interacting with a

00:43:37.10 friend that she has and interact with about the subject she is bringing up the

00:43:42.15 subject of butt plugs versus bronies specifically she is surveying how many

00:43:47.12 of her friends in the 60 year old demographic know either or of these

00:43:50.19 things so she's asked two people so far both of them knew what butt plugs were

00:43:54.20 didn't know what bronies were I don't think you're adopted so the bro.

00:44:00.15 I love that your mom thinks you're an anal expert I just

00:44:04.13 I think she was shocked that I knew I think she was expecting me to say no she

00:44:09.14 really thought they were a fictional thing created for

00:44:13.17 she she was like allow me to spill the tea on buttons

00:44:17.19 so is this like an annual thing like every year when the candle gets lit do

00:44:21.03 you think it'll be a different topical conversation I don't I I'm terrified of

00:44:26.13 what it could possibly be next year but it was just

00:44:29.06 the the absurdity of the conversation that it kept going further and and the

00:44:34.00 questions and the subject it was just it was wild yeah I was stunned I'm still

00:44:39.16 stunned I'm still processing it but I'll keep you guys updated as this survey

00:44:43.10 gets filled up further so far dude zero bronies what's the demographic just

00:44:48.12 middle east 60 year old Canadian women yeah okay

00:44:52.06 oh my god dude well I'll say this Gavin I know what we're getting to Andrew for

00:44:57.12 Christmas and for his birthday and for Christmas and his birthday until he dies

00:45:05.12 how what temperature does titanium melt at

00:45:10.13 the top I have no idea why are you even asking I'm gonna try

00:45:15.23 and whip something up

00:45:19.18 titanium melting temps do you want it in fahrenheit or celsius celsius please

00:45:26.12 1668.

00:45:28.02 Oh that's doable little foundry a little bit of propane for uh for for normal

00:45:33.14 humans that's 3034

00:45:35.22 fahrenheit normal what what why I don't I don't understand what that was

00:45:41.20 what what just happened temperature talk we are temperatures

00:45:46.06 somehow you guys are more baffled going back and forth with that than me hearing

00:45:50.10 my [ __ ] mom talk about butt plugs out of nowhere

00:45:53.12 no I just Americans always think that it's like oh you've got to b you got to

00:45:57.16 convert it for Europeans yeah I would use

00:46:00.14 I was just insulting Gavin because he's not understood yeah

00:46:04.18 even though he's desperate to be yeah do you uh where do you live

00:46:09.18 yeah good point not only do you live in america [ __ ]

00:46:13.10 you live in the most American state in america you live in [ __ ] Texas dude

00:46:17.12 america's great I came home to a cucumber today

00:46:21.14 is that so is that edible how edible is that is that junk cucumber oh my god

00:46:26.19 I gave it I gave it to Millie yesterday in her lunch

00:46:29.18 okay let's give her a hug give her a whole cucumber no I gave her the third

00:46:35.01 that I cut off the part that's the part that's peeled off and chopped off

00:46:39.22 he was saying you gave the whole thing to her this is what she left no no

00:46:45.01 dole out a little bit every day ugh gave her tomatoes you have

00:46:49.18 I gave you the cucumber do you have anything you want to

00:46:52.14 specifically bring up Gavin or should I go jingle jingle finally

00:46:57.16 randy savage clip I also found this this isn't related to uh face but this is

00:47:03.09 what we were talking about last time when Andrew was confused about

00:47:07.14 the full English breakfast oh yeah to be fair I feel like the way you

00:47:12.01 described it was very confusing you said what's the black thing I said black

00:47:17.05 pudding it's like fried blood yeah just fried I didn't have any concept of

00:47:22.13 what fried blood was blood sausage do you like it do I like it no no I hate it

00:47:26.18 is it popular do most people like it I mean if you order full English it's a

00:47:30.12 part of it usually I've ordered a lot of full English and I've never gotten it

00:47:34.06 really yeah I mean it's probably the first thing to go it's the first sort of

00:47:38.15 polarizing item yeah they probably don't even bother like in the tourist areas

00:47:42.12 it's probably hard to get here well I mean blood salts did you get that in the

00:47:46.06 stores don't you it's pretty much what it is no that's what the confusion was I

00:47:51.09 didn't know the prep of making in my head

00:47:53.10 I didn't know what the process was like in the same way canada's bagged milk

00:47:58.00 you're like yeah get a bag of blood go grab some blood

00:48:01.00 misrepresenting it I was like yes it's like fried blood you're like you've

00:48:04.11 misled me it's fly it's fried blood and fat well I wasn't aware of what a blood

00:48:08.16 I asked what I don't know what a blood sausage is so I asked is it part of the

00:48:13.12 blood sausage is that what a blood sausage is is it the blood from the

00:48:17.01 blood sausage and we just moved on moved on just completely stepped over

00:48:21.08 that Eric wants us to talk about jingle jingle jingle should we talk about that

00:48:24.19 yeah hold on a second would you eat blood

00:48:27.13 black pudding or the [ __ ] it's called Andrew oh absolutely not I mean we it

00:48:31.15 took a step further where I would be willing to try different types of blood

00:48:35.03 he thinks every animal's blood would taste the same I was curious if it would

00:48:39.07 there's no way if every meat tastes different then surely the blood would be

00:48:43.01 a different flavor I don't think it would be that wide of a range of flavors

00:48:47.19 black pudding could be uh usually pork or beef I think I bet it's I don't think

00:48:51.21 if you were if you let's say this is a ridiculous conversation if you got super

00:48:56.12 into drinking cow's blood just as a side it was your beverage of choice for a

00:48:59.23 while if we laid out a bunch of different bloods on a table I don't

00:49:03.16 think you'd be able to distinguish which one is cow should we do a blind

00:49:06.22 bloodshot test I think you guys should I think it's

00:49:09.21 gross as [ __ ] I also think Andrew you've

00:49:12.00 got the perfect thing to bring up with your mom next year

00:49:18.13 uh okay so jingle jingle jingle jiggle was uh it's a uniform it's sort of a

00:49:24.06 uniform it's a uniform creation Geoff in some

00:49:27.14 ways okay it was it was a discussion of uh the wrist pocket which will I think

00:49:33.11 either have gone on sale or will be coming on sale soon hopefully it's

00:49:38.06 already on sale but yeah we'll see yeah I haven't actually done the the

00:49:43.04 shitty part yet but it's due tomorrow so

00:49:45.18 I think I'll be doing it most of tonight um

00:49:48.21 and so we're talking about I don't I don't remember how it was like

00:49:53.03 scenarios in which you would use a beef bracelet is that it is that the

00:49:57.01 conversation of it we're talking about clothing items and the way that and in a

00:50:01.20 scenario in which you're in an orgy the beef bracelet would be the field choice

00:50:06.15 I think of anything else like you would need to it would be

00:50:09.21 wearable you can maintain energy you get

00:50:13.09 a snack you don't need to leave the pile it would be the number one

00:50:17.00 number one thing you just stick around you don't have to leave at that point

00:50:20.03 with the beef bracelet as long as you're not into fisting that's that's the way

00:50:23.13 to lose a beef break that's true you gotta be on your non-dominant hand yeah.

00:50:29.01 [Music]

00:50:30.19 What episode of mr bean where he loses is watching the turkey

00:50:36.21 and so we're talking about like how every other item is inferior to the beef

00:50:42.19 bracelet in the orgy scenario and that imagine some guy in the orgy

00:50:47.16 with a [ __ ] fanny pack on with a bunch of keys in it just jingling all

00:50:52.03 over the place his jingle jingle jingle just jiggling all over so that is that

00:50:56.09 was the the original oh we gave the fanny pack the worst thing to wear in

00:51:00.02 order yeah yes it was it was by far because it's

00:51:02.21 just imagining like a janitor in a movie

00:51:06.00 with like that many keys but that guy in an orgy with a fanny pack just a jig

00:51:10.23 exactly just like that and grunting yeah so when we were talking about uniform

00:51:16.17 and the value of the beef bracelet I think we really missed the orgy market

00:51:21.10 and that demographic I think we really could have angled better to them

00:51:25.05 I think that would be I'm trying to think there are other products right

00:51:28.13 where like they made it and then it got adopted in a way that they didn't all

00:51:32.02 intend yeah that's what always of course absolutely happens all the time I think

00:51:35.09 that's maybe where the beef bracelet would go I think

00:51:38.05 it would maybe I mean a huge hit like wrigley's gum started out as a soap

00:51:42.13 company and now they make gum yeah they would include like it was like during

00:51:45.12 the great depression or around that time

00:51:47.16 and so they had to like they were coming

00:51:50.12 up with like incentives uh like we would give away a free air freshener with a

00:51:54.10 shirt maybe uh in the in the okay store uh but they would give away like a free

00:51:55.18 piece of gum when you would buy soap to convince people to buy it and then the

00:52:00.05 soap the gum became so popular they just

00:52:03.05 said [ __ ] the soap and uh went all in on gun wow

00:52:06.14 just to clarify what nick said did you say leave the pile I absolutely did yeah

00:52:10.20 of course I assume it's just a pile I've never been in an orgy I haven't I

00:52:14.04 haven't even seen eyes wide shut which I feel like would probably be didn't you

00:52:19.09 get invited to an orgy once though did I did yeah the homeless orgy yeah

00:52:23.14 yeah we have covered that I've received an invite to a homeless orgy but I've

00:52:27.05 never I didn't attend that wouldn't be the jingliest orgy because

00:52:31.04 homeless people typically have more loose change and also just like nuts and

00:52:35.22 bolts and [ __ ] probably just random stuff what

00:52:37.11 just whatever you find off the ground

00:52:42.00 yeah I mean you figure like homeless people are probably they have to be uh

00:52:46.12 resourceful so if you see something that could be useful down the road you want

00:52:50.00 to pick it up well nuts and bolts though I don't know I was

00:52:54.17 thinking to [ __ ] the clanks man you can build a shanty with nuts and

00:52:58.21 bolts if you have enough spare ones around sure yeah that's what the newest

00:53:04.07 banjo-kazooie was about it is nuts and bolts magic suite nuts and bolts oh

00:53:09.12 I'm gonna be playing donkey Kong this weekend

00:53:13.21 that's a thing that's sort of happening for whoever hears this but yeah just in

00:53:18.19 the context of when we're doing this are you excited no not at all

00:53:23.01 what's your game plan at 44 hours right yeah is that it okay

00:53:28.04 great yeah this okay well you have you you have to you reserve the right to add

00:53:32.20 another four hours yeah I'm not gonna let it I'm gonna I'm fine I'm not gonna

00:53:36.16 need it I'm good I'm excited I'll uh do you have all your snacks and

00:53:40.12 everything ready no I'm gonna do that tomorrow I gotta prepare tomorrow I

00:53:43.10 gotta take it seriously gotta get my blood sausage and my my fried blood now

00:53:48.15 and uh what else what happened last time you knocked it

00:53:52.08 off the table or something what do you mean what happened oh why did it not say

00:53:56.12 I I realized that the save function didn't work for how I was playing it so

00:54:00.12 I had to turn my computer off until then

00:54:02.13 I did and I lost all my progress what do you mean from how you were playing it I

00:54:06.05 was playing it on on a computer oh I wasn't like playing it through an n64

00:54:09.13 because using an empty what are you doing this time I'm going to use it I'm

00:54:12.21 going to use the exact same emulator and I'm just not going to I'm not going to

00:54:16.16 turn my computer off until I beat it oh man what if the power goes out you're a

00:54:21.04 lunatic if the if the power goes out that would be a problem that would be

00:54:25.09 unfortunate yeah I would lose he's gonna he's gonna

00:54:28.09 wiggle out of this yeah how am I gonna wiggle out you know he's gonna roll out

00:54:32.02 of him listen to this listen to how he's already said

00:54:35.12 no he can't I can't be the only one who sees this coming no there's no I don't

00:54:40.23 it doesn't I whatever happens if I don't beat it if I don't get the end credits

00:54:46.00 within the time limit I lose doesn't matter so if your computer so your power

00:54:49.17 goes out your computer turns off doesn't even have to be your power going out

00:54:54.00 something sure some windows update whatever it is yeah your computer

00:54:57.05 restarts you lose all your progress you're fine with that no I will accept

00:55:02.01 the loss a hundred percent I won't get an n64 you got time I don't know how

00:55:07.09 seems like a lot of [ __ ] what do you mean I have time I already I think I

00:55:11.12 already have one I don't have the game would be the game well yeah tomorrow

00:55:16.20 what am I just got a used game store in Vancouver you could go to uh there's

00:55:21.13 like two in my town and I don't know if they would have that versus the

00:55:26.17 expansion pack too also then how would I stream off of my n64 um

00:55:31.08 uh hdmi adapter so now it would send me a [ __ ] list

00:55:35.02 of things I now need to get and well we could have got you all this stuff well

00:55:38.03 if you mentioned it uh three weeks ago when you decided to do this we could

00:55:41.21 have had it all planned out for you that's fair I'm not gonna argue that

00:55:46.13 point that's fair uh I think it'll be oh I can you please argue the point I have

00:55:51.16 to know oh I mean what would I I I mean I guess I don't know

00:55:55.11 is it assumed who streams off of an n64

00:55:58.03 I don't feel like that's all that common I think most people are streaming

00:56:01.16 against.

00:56:10.06 [Applause]

00:56:15.14 I said I wasn't gonna argue it I never came from a position if this was a great

00:56:20.16 argument this is a ridiculous thing you just did

00:56:24.22 it's a madness it's going quiet it's not a good argument how are you doing Geoff

00:56:33.12 you okay you not laughing I'm trying not to laugh

00:56:39.05 you got me so bad with your mom though you have no idea how much pain

00:56:45.03 you caused me it was brutal oh I just love the idea of the tail and the

00:56:50.17 butt plug coming up and her just snuffing the candle out and walking

00:56:55.13 there is no god blows the candle out that's a bridge too far

00:57:00.13 I thought I was losing my mind yesterday I uh I got some new headphones like

00:57:06.01 airpods sort of things and um they're paired to my phone and I also

00:57:10.20 paired them to my iMac where I edit stuff and I was listening to

00:57:15.16 the I was proofing the next episode of face that nix or Dennis sent and if I

00:57:20.15 pause something with the headphones and then resume it within a short amount of

00:57:26.03 time it just continues what I was doing but I guess if I've used my phone too

00:57:30.13 much in between or enough time has passed for some reason it just decides

00:57:35.00 I've given up on this connection to the phone I'm now on the mac

00:57:39.07 and what it was doing and this is where I thought I was losing my mind

00:57:43.07 on my mac if you open like the music app I guess it's the what iTunes became I I

00:57:49.03 never used the app but what I had on there was a ringtone I just made

00:57:53.21 uh which is like a little clip from my pinball machine I just turned it into my

00:57:57.12 ringtone but to do that I had to like put it through that music app and all

00:58:01.02 that stuff and then the next file down was some lines I had dan record for some

00:58:06.08 slow-mo video where I was having him pretend to be a robot and um I guess

00:58:11.18 when I tried to resume my my phone playback of face it decided

00:58:16.13 hey I'm controlling the iMac now and it started playing my ringtone so I was

00:58:22.09 like oh I get a call so I double tap the side of the

00:58:27.01 airpods to answer the call but when no one's actually calling you it just skips

00:58:31.20 track so it skipped to the next track which was dan going hey b and I was like

00:58:38.13 maybe and because he was doing like because he was doing multiple takes

00:58:43.20 he just kept saying it different like intonations so he was like hey b and I

00:58:48.23 was like uh hey b and he was like hey b and I was like hey v

00:58:56.17 and I'm just there in my freaking kitchen

00:59:00.02 talking to audiophiles that are playing on my mac in a different room it took me

00:59:06.08 it took me about 45 seconds to realize I

00:59:09.18 wasn't actually on the phone with dan it was like such a weird

00:59:14.15 series of events and I was like oh my god I'm like 60 years old

00:59:19.09 this technology's running circles around me I just was so confused

00:59:24.05 I hate you so much

00:59:26.21 and it's not like I had the app open I've tested it out

00:59:30.15 it just opens the music app on my mac and there's only like a bunch of things

00:59:35.14 I I just couldn't believe that that's what was actually happening

00:59:39.18 looks incredible what a perfect ah I wish I could post I wish I could post

00:59:47.09 my security footage of me just staring at my kitchen cabinets

00:59:52.21 thinking I'm on the host can you post the audio maybe of his

00:59:57.10 different takes and like that would be great I'd love to hear

01:00:01.17 the one side and that was like that was after after all that was done it was

01:00:05.19 like 20 minutes of trying to figure out where the audio was actually coming from

01:00:09.03 because I didn't know that they were stored in the music app I was so

01:00:12.09 confused that I got to give up on technology that is the most amazing [ __ ]

01:00:17.12 technology I agree with you got it dude oh [ __ ] I am having a

01:00:22.12 problem with my car play it's so ugh but uh that's maybe the funniest story

01:00:27.12 I've heard in a year that's fantastic well I'm just trying not to laugh

01:00:46.10 house how do you even make that happen it it

01:00:55.07 yeah because you're intimate who would have as the last two files

01:01:04.19 friends saying hello like no one has those two files oh

01:01:08.18 god that's maybe I'll make a little uh a little video
