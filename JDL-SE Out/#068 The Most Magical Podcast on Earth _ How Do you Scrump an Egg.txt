00:00:32.10 Hello and welcome to the most magical place on earth the magical podcast

00:00:38.21 face where exceptional people do mind-bending

00:00:43.07 things and break the laws of physics my name is Geoff Ramsey and with me always

00:00:48.23 uh as always Andrew pen ton and Gavin free

00:00:51.23 I don't know I don't know I don't know what to say about that we just finished

00:00:55.05 recording another episode where you missed out on about two minutes of just

00:00:59.03 bewilderment and then we press record again if you haven't listened to the

00:01:03.03 last episode go listen to it and then come back and listen to this one that we

00:01:07.07 stopped down Eric said what the [ __ ] nick said I'm scared and

00:01:11.14 I honestly don't know what to think about it I I feel like Andrew is

00:01:16.12 pranking all of us now no I absolutely not I thought you were pranking me when

00:01:20.07 you're like what did you say I wrote the number before you said it

00:01:24.10 because I couldn't see the screen I didn't know what you did I thought you

00:01:26.10 didn't say it publicly I thought you're just gonna pretend that it was the right

00:01:29.20 number and I'm like he's [ __ ] with me there's no way that it just happened and

00:01:33.11 it did and even if you did see the screen there's no way you could have got

00:01:37.20 the 19 ball out and taken a picture of it that quickly absolutely not no he

00:01:41.17 would have had to have already had 60

00:01:43.22 photos like in a file tree and then he would have to like rapidly click on this

00:01:48.19 nobody's gonna put that much work into that that bid no way no

00:01:53.20 absolutely not that that was [ __ ]

00:01:56.06 crazy I feel like we've been wrong about this whole Gavin being lucky thing

00:02:00.02 I feel like it might be you Geoff you might be

00:02:03.16 the goal yeah I guess wrong well maybe I this I think this bo I I'll tell you

00:02:07.09 what I feel uh I feel I feel like if naji Harris knew what was going on here

00:02:11.06 he'd feel very good about himself right now things are looking up for him let's

00:02:15.00 put this to the ultimate test once again

00:02:17.06 the true if you're better than Gavin red or black red or black

00:02:21.10 uh black I mean I don't know why you're betting on colors when you should

00:02:25.05 clearly be betting on 19.

00:02:27.01 That's a fascinating point that's a great point I'm going to do colors then 19.

00:02:32.10 19 is our lucky number now okay tell me face officially has a lucky number uh

00:02:37.18 what am I doing red or black red okay I'm putting 3 on red 2 on 19.

00:02:42.21 [Laughter]

00:02:43.23 19 is red if 19 was black this would be a problem

00:02:50.02 can't parlay roulette spin Eric this is ridiculous how dare you okay the ball's

00:02:55.09 rolling around coming in it's bouncing still spinning

00:03:00.11 I've I've been going with the wrong person the whole time I will be very

00:03:05.22 it's black and it's too magic doesn't exist it's not it's not it's black

00:03:11.03 I think magic does exist you just can't use it like that it decides it decides

00:03:16.06 when it when it wants to be used yeah our magic just

00:03:20.23 rejects you every time you try and use it

00:03:26.06 what we really need to do is when Geoff's

00:03:28.18 in Vegas he needs to play 19 on roulette

00:03:32.02 he does I'll do it I'll do it I'll do it and I'll report back dude this Henry

00:03:36.07 farted so bad

00:03:38.10 you got gassed by the dog I'll make it I'm getting gassed out of the room Jesus

00:03:43.21 that's brutal I'm looking in jersey numbers I don't I don't think any of

00:03:48.19 them are 19 unfortunately do you gamble every day no not at all no

00:03:53.09 I don't know dude I I've been talking to

00:03:55.19 Andrew quite a bit since you've been out of town and I've been having a lot of

00:03:59.11 conversations with what I would call dark Andrew and that is uh that is like

00:04:04.22 midnight our time Andrew who has had a bad run and is in a is not in a good

00:04:10.11 place and I feel like we've had a lot of those conversations in the last since

00:04:15.07 you've been gone so well it's it's because you expressed interest and

00:04:18.22 wanting to uh do some nfl bets so I've been trying to update you on what's been

00:04:22.02 going I've been trying to let you vicariously live through my misery

00:04:25.18 you know I I definitely have been I just feel like that misery has been pretty

00:04:30.13 daily no it's weekends I'll I'll throw a bet on on like

00:04:33.09 Saturday I don't bet all that often and if I'm gonna bet it's mainly during the

00:04:38.04 nfl season we're getting into okay what about the

00:04:41.19 astros rangers bet you lost your [ __ I on that's why I parlayed that with nfl

00:04:45.20 preseason and that was a Saturday I think or a Sunday it's a weekend doesn't

00:04:49.22 count I bet the astros Gavin the astros were

00:04:53.03 this huge favorite against the shitty other baseball team and they lost in the

00:04:58.00 first inning they dropped down 3-0 the astrals were down 3-0 fifth inning they

00:05:03.07 come back to make it 5-2 I'm like there's a hope there's some hope in this game

00:05:08.11 next time I look at the score the astros are losing 2-12 they got demolished by

00:05:13.18 one of the worst teams of baseball terrible luck

00:05:16.19 I actually I actually have a little sports thing that I read about I don't

00:05:20.09 know stop me if you guys have heard this story but have you guys heard the thing

00:05:25.09 that happened with uh bishop sycamore high school on ESPN like last weekend no

00:05:29.15 uh it's they were like a fake school right or something so maybe yeah so

00:05:34.06 there was this from time to time ESPN will show high

00:05:36.23 school football games especially when they're 1a and there's a there's a ton

00:05:41.16 of like top tier talent that's going to go into college

00:05:44.10 and I actually I actually skipped through the game I was looking for Emily

00:05:46.17 and I were looking for pre-season football and we stopped on it I was like

00:05:49.23 ah this [ __ ] high school we kept going but uh up so on I think it was

00:05:53.23 last Sunday but maybe two sun days ago there was a high school game with one of

00:05:57.15 the best high school uh football teams in the country and they played this

00:06:02.21 other team called bishop sycamore high school and beat the dog [ __ ] out of him

00:06:07.12 the game was 58 to nothing to the point where pretty early on the announcers

00:06:11.11 were saying stuff like should they just call the game like people they were

00:06:15.14 worried about the other team's safety they were getting they were so

00:06:18.23 outmatched and getting so manhandled and

00:06:20.18 so beaten they were like I don't know if this is safe for these two teams to be

00:06:24.18 playing and it became very cl it was billed as like two tier one football

00:06:29.07 teams with some of the best talent in the nation playing against each other

00:06:32.23 became apparent very quickly that was not the

00:06:36.00 case then uh they started to dive into it and discover like ESPN was like we're

00:06:40.08 sorry we shouldn't have put this game on

00:06:42.21 the air it comes to find out you come to find out that the game was actually

00:06:46.17 scheduled by a marketing company uh well I guess that's something that happens

00:06:50.12 like marketing companies schedule high school games for ESPN they've been doing

00:06:53.20 it for a long time then it came out that it might not be a real school that

00:06:57.23 doesn't have like it has a po box for an address and then there was some uh then

00:07:02.13 it came out that the the coach of the football team

00:07:06.12 might have an active arrest warrant for fraud

00:07:08.17 then it came out that this team that played on Sunday also played a game on

00:07:12.11 Friday so they played two high school games in two days then

00:07:16.23 people started to dive in realize this team has never won a game before

00:07:20.23 and have has no business being playing against this other team then people

00:07:24.23 discovered that a lot of the players on the team weren't actually high school

00:07:28.09 students and were adults it just kept getting weirder and weirder that's so

00:07:33.11 strange you've made me want to dig deeper into this it's similar to that

00:07:37.05 that mentally handicapped was it basketball team who all turned

00:07:41.07 out to be just like they weren't they shouldn't have been in the paralympics

00:07:46.17 I've heard of I know that a movie called the ringer exists and I do not think

00:07:50.07 that that was based on a true story that was johnny Knoxville yeah in the early

00:07:53.20 2000s I think that's sort of the plot of that movie I don't really remember what

00:07:57.14 that movie was about I I just don't understand what the goal would be was it to

00:08:01.10 like what's the play there what what where's where's the fraud you know is it

00:08:05.12 to legitimize this bishop sycamore school or was it to make the other team

00:08:10.01 look that much better like what's the play there you know what I mean like I

00:08:15.03 can't figure out what the grift is that is bizarre

00:08:18.01 that's crazy so many levels deep yeah and I haven't I haven't read up on it

00:08:21.17 lately so there may be more information to it it's just like it's just crazy

00:08:25.05 like it was just like every story was like wackier than the next and they were

00:08:28.21 just like keep peeling back these layers that made no sense this sort of reminds

00:08:32.04 me of a conversation we had Gavin about how football in Europe works with the

00:08:36.23 teams in different leagues I feel like you got totally lost in that

00:08:40.21 conversation what do you mean you just seemed very confused and what why I no I

00:08:45.16 wasn't lost I understood everything he was saying I was just saying it's a lot

00:08:48.20 of details like he gave a lot of surface information that would be interesting

00:08:52.06 interesting to explore deeper but you were like why can't they jump up from

00:08:55.20 the bottom division into the premier league oh I see

00:08:59.00 you just [ __ ] threw now I'm confused I thought you were talking about I seem

00:09:02.12 confused during Geoff's conversation about the high school team not our

00:09:06.00 football conversation that's why I was like what are you

00:09:08.23 talking about I followed that I followed that closely wait so you change the

00:09:12.19 subject to a new subject and then I respond to it and you think I'm still in

00:09:16.06 the old subject yeah well you just said you seem confused in that conversation I

00:09:19.22 didn't feel like we had gone far enough into the conversation to call this

00:09:23.02 conversation I misunderstood you're referencing the text conversation that

00:09:26.23 we had David is explaining to me and correct me

00:09:30.06 if I'm wrong you may already notice Geoff but I guess in the premier league the

00:09:35.04 bottom two teams get dropped to a lower league and the top two of the league

00:09:39.08 below go up to that league yeah it's called relegation shifting right it's

00:09:42.23 what's called right Gavin relegation yeah you get promoted or relegated yeah

00:09:46.12 and it's the top top or bottom three teams I think that shouldn't end I think

00:09:50.16 that should be at all levels of play I want a team to start in the premier

00:09:54.16 league and then be so bad that they're in like a youth league at that by the

00:09:58.14 end of it like I don't I think you should be able to just keep going down

00:10:02.09 if you keep losing can you go keep going up yeah but that is what happens if you

00:10:06.23 lose if you lose if you're bottom three again the next season you would go down

00:10:11.01 again but there's a limit to it you said there was a cap of like you can only

00:10:15.01 fall so far I want it to be like I spent five billion dollars on this team I'm

00:10:19.03 now playing in a field behind an elementary school like I want there to

00:10:24.12 be a huge collapse so you want to see Manchester city go

00:10:28.19 from the premier league to a club team absolutely

00:10:32.08 yes I want like Manchester united to be in a league where one of the parents has

00:10:37.16 to bring orange slices every game like that's the fall of

00:10:42.04 I mean you do get premier league teams who

00:10:44.05 may drop like two or three divisions but it would take two or three years to do

00:10:48.10 it you would have to you'd have to lose multiple back-to-back seasons you can't

00:10:52.19 just jump three down in one year yeah no I know

00:10:56.08 that I'm saying year by year I just I I like the idea of a billion dollar

00:11:00.03 franchise being in an orange slice league division and somebody who runs a

00:11:05.03 youth team all of a sudden being in a [ __ ] stadium yeah I love I love

00:11:08.22 some local village having to go to old trafford to play

00:11:13.07 menu because they've been relocated so many times what uh what like

00:11:17.12 can we look that up like what's the farthest the team has fallen from it

00:11:20.19 yeah how would you Google that I don't know I mean this all came about because

00:11:26.08 I was watching ted lasso and there's they mentioned that in in the show

00:11:31.01 where I guess the nfl if you finish bottom of the league you just come back

00:11:34.16 again next year yeah and play again and you see you're still in the nfl well

00:11:38.15 there isn't really a minor leagues for the nfl like it's just what if you suck

00:11:42.10 do you just lose over and over and over again and then you you don't go anywhere

00:11:46.08 and there's no opportunity for a new team how do you get into your team

00:11:49.18 money a lot of money and you don't you're just shifting

00:11:53.12 it's that's that's like you what you're describing is the Orlando magic it sucks

00:11:57.11 you just don't get to be a good team how

00:12:00.13 does the whole sport not just get really stale

00:12:02.18 yeah Jacksonville jaguars great call you get a number one pick if you're dead

00:12:06.15 last you theoretically are getting good talent the way it's supposed to work is

00:12:10.20 the worse a team does the better they get they do in the draft so they get

00:12:14.11 access to the best players that are coming into the league so it's supposed

00:12:18.02 to balance it out like if you were the wor like you were

00:12:20.21 the Cleveland cavaliers a perennially shitty team that under performs in a

00:12:25.15 small market then you get the first pick and you get to pick LeBron James

00:12:29.19 and they did it doesn't seem like a huge

00:12:31.23 incentive like the risk of dropping from one league to the league below is

00:12:36.21 financially huge like ginormous amount of money

00:12:40.17 different so yeah I don't understand the incentive to

00:12:44.06 play well in the nfl if you could just sit at the bottom year after year well

00:12:49.04 if you don't play well for long enough that you might lose your team they might

00:12:52.23 just move to another city but also there is no there's no league below that for

00:12:57.16 you to play yeah it would be like the top cfl team would go up to the nfl and

00:13:02.05 then just lose every game like it wouldn't there's no yeah

00:13:05.06 that's it's insane especially considering the size of this country there's

00:13:10.00 one league insane well there's the xfl is going to

00:13:13.10 come back I think next year yeah but if you're saying it's not in relation to

00:13:17.05 the nfl it's not it's not you drop into that one oh no absolutely not this could

00:13:21.18 technically work what you're describing could work in the nba because there is a

00:13:25.12 minor leagues there's a d-league and it could work in baseball because there's

00:13:29.05 the you know there's a ball but yeah it's just there's just no there's no

00:13:32.20 infrastructure for that in football they could theoretically do it with baseball

00:13:36.13 and basketball though the problem isn't the fact that they're it's not just a

00:13:40.18 structure problem it's a all the best talent plays in one league problem like

00:13:44.15 you even though there is an infrastructure in basketball nobody's

00:13:48.17 opting to play in the g league over the nba yeah

00:13:51.11 I said d league energy league sorry you're right hockey I mean it's a

00:13:54.07 completely other thing for the draft the draft in hockey is sort of ridiculous

00:13:57.14 where even like unless you have a top top pick

00:14:00.21 you're like yeah that player will help us in three years can't wait that's fun

00:14:06.13 like there's no the nfl has massive turnover and I don't know if football

00:14:10.04 like soccer football has the same or a team could be wildly awful one season

00:14:14.14 and then have a great off season and become a playoff team I don't know what

00:14:18.01 the competitive shift is and I should point out that in in soccer football

00:14:22.21 there's no playoffs either you just finish you just play every

00:14:26.07 other team twice and then that's it that's nothing yeah that's no fun and if

00:14:31.10 you have the same amount of points at the top of the league you just see

00:14:35.11 who scored more goals I learned about a thing recently about so

00:14:39.18 goal differential is a big thing in football right for like determining

00:14:42.20 seating or whatever I don't know if that's across all

00:14:45.14 football in this league specifically there's a tournament and goal

00:14:49.12 differential between teams was a big factor in like the playoff setting or or

00:14:54.09 I guess who would advance to the finals and the two teams start playing each

00:14:57.23 other one was in the finals the other one was out of it and they needed to win

00:15:02.12 by two goals to advance for this tournament they created a weird like

00:15:06.15 let's make it spicy they decided that a golden goal would be worth two

00:15:10.12 which correct me if I'm wrong Gavin a golden goal is if you score with the

00:15:13.21 extra time remaining right like it ends the game that's the last goal

00:15:16.16 essentially is that what a golden goal is golden goal yeah I think they stopped

00:15:20.08 doing it but yeah it was uh an extra time the first goal what ended

00:15:23.16 the game yeah so they had this rule for this tournament where a golden goal now

00:15:27.19 counted for two the team that needed to win by two was winning by one and there

00:15:33.22 was like six or seven minutes left and they thought

00:15:36.12 we probably aren't going to score within this time we need more time and we need

00:15:41.05 two goals it's better if we just score on ourselves and force it to go into

00:15:45.14 overtime so they just played pass with the keeper

00:15:48.07 back and forth for a bit and then they scored in their own net and the other

00:15:51.22 team was like what the [ __ ] is going on and then they realized oh there's this

00:15:58.04 weird two goal golden goal rule so there is a brief period of time before like

00:16:02.06 overtime started where one team was trying to score in either net because

00:16:07.05 they could lose by one they just couldn't lose by two

00:16:11.01 and the other team had to protect both goals and they were not

00:16:15.11 the team that needed to protect both or scoring either didn't do it they went to

00:16:20.02 overtime and the team that scored on themselves then scored the golden goal

00:16:24.04 one and pushed the other team out of the

00:16:26.10 finals because they scored on themselves and got into that position that is like

00:16:30.20 that [ __ ] yeah it's great I wish that there was more ridiculousness like that

00:16:34.12 in football that is sort of in the spirit of my rule of teams can fall

00:16:38.17 endlessly yeah that would make me way more interested in that sport [Applause]

00:20:02.03 [Music]

00:20:03.07 Eric says what was the thing we needed to cover in this episode yeah we kind of

00:20:07.13 went on a weird sports car we have a few

00:20:09.14 things we could talk about you guys want to talk about your jet ski was that on

00:20:13.05 anyone's list well we just spent 20

00:20:16.02 minutes talking about no no not at all I don't even know how we got we got

00:20:20.02 there because I drew 19 from the bing the ping pong but

00:20:22.20 so we talked about this we blew up this episode on on the end of last week's

00:20:27.02 episode yeah okay that was a great flub by the way Andrew I don't want that

00:20:31.11 glossy I didn't I was gonna call it a ping pong machine a bingo machine and a

00:20:35.06 lot of machine it is just

00:20:38.13 a machine well Gavin do you want to talk about the

00:20:41.22 jet ski adventure we went on jet skis um so I think

00:20:46.15 I wasn't imagining jet skiing right because when

00:20:50.08 because when you were describing how you were going on jet skis and you said you

00:20:54.15 went like 50 miles an hour I just thought you were exaggerating I just

00:20:57.22 thought you were rounding just plucking a random number and you would have been

00:21:02.08 going like 18 miles an hour or something but they really go 50 miles an hour

00:21:07.22 we got out of the slow bit and then Emily absolutely flawed it and I think my

00:21:13.12 mouth just fell open because I was still like I was still trying to remember all

00:21:17.11 the stuff the guy told me I looked down to be like okay though there's a

00:21:20.17 speedometer there's okay here's how I did I looked up you were on the horizon

00:21:24.21 you were like going around the curvature of the earth you were hauling us

00:21:30.03 they go so fast and I it really took me a while to like

00:21:34.04 to brave it and get up to that speed I think I I was freaking out at 30 because

00:21:40.02 at that speed you know any tiny little bump in the you know in the waves will

00:21:44.11 just send you into the air so I said oh god and so you'd see a wave coming and

00:21:47.21 I'd immediately let off because I was like I'm just gonna go sailing off this

00:21:51.19 thing yeah and I would slow down to like what felt like maybe 15 and it would

00:21:56.02 just slam my ass against the sea I'd be like oh and I'd be like oh damn I'm glad

00:22:01.11 I wasn't going 30.

00:22:03.03 I feel like every wave you had visions of kanye flying through the air like

00:22:06.09 that dude yeah well that is one thing as we were because we did about we did

00:22:10.00 three hours which I'd learned is maybe a little long uh usually we do too

00:22:15.01 uh but I felt like every minute was closer to the

00:22:19.09 inevitable accident that we're building towards like the second Gavin and I got

00:22:24.12 on the on the same water and two different jet skis I just realized that

00:22:30.03 that an accident is like is an inevitability that is metaphysical

00:22:34.22 certitude that Gavin and I will get into a jet ski accident together and it

00:22:38.17 didn't we dodged it that day but I can feel the gravity of that accident

00:22:43.06 pulling us forward the bad thing is was that the amount of time it took me to

00:22:47.13 gain just a little bit of confidence was extremely short I would say after 20

00:22:51.21 minutes I was just trying to I was like finding the the smooth bits of the water

00:22:55.07 you're trying to get out the way of other boat wakes and stuff to the point

00:22:58.07 where I was like all right let's see let's see how fast this one goes and I

00:23:01.22 would just eek up a little bit each time like 10 minutes later I'd be like a 40.

00:23:05.16 And then eventually I was just like I'm just going to hold this down and see

00:23:08.15 what I could get to and I got it to the point where the speedometer literally

00:23:12.16 stopped at 55 miles an hour and then I let off and I was like oh I'm getting

00:23:18.04 some confidence now I I'd say 30 minutes later I had a sustained three minute

00:23:22.07 period where I was just going 55 miles an hour and at that point I was like

00:23:26.20 this thing's not fast enough anymore I want to go even faster than this and I

00:23:30.14 there was a one point where I was I was holding it down the jet ski sounded like

00:23:34.02 it was going to explode it had just a sustain I was like

00:23:37.07 this is going to overheat I was sustained 55 for about three straight

00:23:41.07 minutes and I looked down at the fuel gauge and as I looked it just went blue

00:23:45.03 and it popped down like one whole bar I will say at the end I asked you I was

00:23:50.06 like how do you think how you feel about it man and you said it's amazing how

00:23:54.07 quickly you go from holy [ __ ] 50 miles an hour is so fast on a jet ski two why

00:24:00.02 won't this thing go faster than 50 miles an hour yeah I could just totally

00:24:04.02 the same with me on roller coasters like

00:24:06.00 if I go to a theme park the first roller coaster I set foot on I'm thinking why

00:24:10.11 am I on a roller coaster this is terrifying I hate this I've got my eyes

00:24:13.19 closed I'm like gripping as hard as I can

00:24:16.03 but maybe three or four rides later I'm like why isn't there one that goes 150

00:24:20.13 miles an hour

00:24:22.12 so then you have to you have to just try other stuff like

00:24:26.07 they were like well you know if you tip over a jet ski here's how you write it

00:24:30.02 you don't have a lot of time I think was it like 60 seconds or something to tip

00:24:34.00 it over before 60 seconds here so I was just thinking

00:24:37.03 how violently can I turn on this thing let's just see like what does it take to

00:24:40.17 tip one of these and then I started chasing someone's boat I was probably

00:24:44.17 like 100 feet behind it and just doing little jumps off the wakes just doing

00:24:47.18 some some stuff that you shouldn't have been doing the first time you've ever in

00:24:51.12 the jet ski but oh my god it was fun and then and then Geoff and I were taking in

00:24:55.17 turns to do little jumps over this week the uh that is like the best part about

00:25:00.16 being on the jet ski is is driving behind a bigger boat and just jumping

00:25:05.05 off their wake you feel like uh like a horse fly on on the back of a cow or a

00:25:09.05 horse you know it's like trying to swat you away and you're just like you're

00:25:12.10 just like jumping around it bugging it but it is so much [ __ ] fun I'm really

00:25:16.17 glad you enjoyed it because uh it is like the most fun

00:25:19.08 it's weird you really get a feel like a visual feel about what the water's like

00:25:23.03 like there's areas where it is just flat there's nothing happening and you can

00:25:26.19 really go then there's areas of chop where it's like a small amount but you

00:25:31.05 know that if you go too fast you will just slam your [ __ ] on the seat it

00:25:35.13 will like pound your spine yeah there's like this in-between phase where there's

00:25:40.01 a lot of small waves and you can absolutely floor over those because you

00:25:43.15 just kind of glide along the top of them so you'll hear it go like

00:25:47.06 as you're just sailing over the very tops so it's like immediate it's like

00:25:50.10 you you learn all this stuff just from from looking at the water in front of

00:25:53.20 you and then you end up being a pretty good judge of what you can do do you

00:25:56.22 remember the the prize we found floating in the water that we all almost hit

00:26:01.22 what oh my god there was a point where we were jumping

00:26:07.09 wakes and we were like getting airborne and I jumped a bit like we jumped a big

00:26:12.12 thing and came down in the water and kind of like

00:26:16.07 and looked up and I looked to my left and I screamed out loud because there

00:26:20.16 was a giant hoof looking at me floating out of the water a foot away and we look

00:26:25.15 over and there's just a giant dead [ __ I deer just floating in the sea in

00:26:30.13 the middle in the middle of lake Austin like I just

00:26:33.23 I don't know how much a deer is like hundreds and 100800 pound deer maybe I

00:26:38.01 don't know 600 years the entire [ __ ]

00:26:41.07 thing just like his dead eyes staring out of the sky

00:26:43.22 [ __ ] hooves it was it was gruesome how close were you to landing on it

00:26:47.22 probably within like three or four feet Jesus yeah did you go like alongside it

00:26:51.19 or over it because I feel like you know I went to the ride really yeah I landed

00:26:55.19 like next to it when ah and then moved over to the right but I behind us was

00:27:01.05 about 400 boats pulling uh like skiers and skim boarders and

00:27:05.00 wakeboarders and [ __ ] so I gotta imagine

00:27:08.00 that a couple of people probably hit it or had closer run-ins with it than we

00:27:12.23 did so I have two immediate questions um one is

00:27:15.16 Geoff sent me a video of the jet skiing experience with you Gavin is that up

00:27:20.00 anywhere has have people seen that yet we should put that put on Instagram I

00:27:23.14 can't wait yeah I think we'll put it up with this

00:27:25.21 episode I uh it's a good call I haven't uploaded that we should put that on

00:27:29.09 Instagram maybe even I know it's only like a YouTube thing I don't know but we

00:27:32.13 should have that in a place where people could see I love that video it's

00:27:36.00 fantastic I'm a big that was just that's the only thing I knew about this

00:27:39.18 experience going into it the second question I have

00:27:42.18 you guys mentioned accidents and we're talking about sports in my mind I don't

00:27:47.16 know if this exists I assume it doesn't could we do some form of like jet ski

00:27:51.11 jousting adjusting with like two sticks and like a giant pillow or like a foam

00:27:55.22 thing and just smash into it I don't I'm not saying 50. I'm not

00:27:59.17 saying we're going your crazy speed I feel like there's a medium I feel like

00:28:03.11 this could be the evolution of jousting I would pay so much money to watch two

00:28:07.13 jet skis go parallel well I feel like the thing is even if you collide

00:28:11.17 accidentally head-on at 10 you're gonna bang heads with the other person at 20

00:28:16.01 miles an hour combined no you're not you

00:28:18.08 got to be there's a separation there has

00:28:20.12 to be a barrier I'm regulating the sport you're not just going

00:28:24.19 yeah well that's fine you won't die from that I'm just saying we get a bear

00:28:28.18 there's a way to do this I don't like that you're immediately cutting down my

00:28:32.13 idea on a regulation aspect of it like you're ignoring any of the fun you're

00:28:36.10 just like there are safety concerns what if the jet skis were aimed into each

00:28:40.17 other what do you think about this Geoff uh

00:28:44.08 I think Andrew uh should spearhead it I I think Andrew I think you should come

00:28:48.06 jet skiing with us yeah first and then see if you still think that's a good

00:28:51.20 idea yeah it seems like it would be fun to watch I didn't say it was a good idea

00:28:56.15 well I agree it would be it would be fun for me to watch you guys do this

00:29:01.20 I don't want to run this league I don't want to kill anybody yeah

00:29:05.17 it's different if you witness it happening I do think I'm not sure where

00:29:09.21 to go with this but I feel like we there is more content to be had in the world

00:29:14.15 of jet skiing I think it's the highest jump quest I think that's a great idea

00:29:20.00 Gavin because I think we've been fantastic we both easily jumped

00:29:24.10 how high do you think we went on our max jumps

00:29:26.11 I mean in my head in my head like 20

00:29:28.12 feet in reality maybe probably five feet four or five feet I

00:29:33.07 definitely got some air I got enough air to [ __ ]

00:29:36.17 slam my knee so hard I thought I broke it

00:29:39.00 is that the evolution of the Geoff trick video is the next one going to be a jet

00:29:43.13 ski slow motion I think it has to be I just put up the Gavin slomo uh jet ski

00:29:48.08 video in the slack it's fantastic or in the discord rather yeah I think I think

00:29:52.17 that's the evolution is a jet ski stunt I wonder okay so what if we get one of

00:29:56.20 those floating ramps that you get in gta yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah like a

00:30:01.02 she's calling my idea dumb and then your reference point is a thing in gta

00:30:06.04 how do we get how do we get one of those sprunk ramps

00:30:10.19 we gotta get someone to make us a sprunk wrap [Laughter]

00:30:18.12 that's a great this is a great is a great place to take the bike trick the

00:30:22.07 next one it's definitely you know what we could do too gav is we could do uh

00:30:26.15 synchronized tricks oh yeah see I feel like that's as dangerous in

00:30:31.14 my mind as my adjusting idea you two trying to do tricks at the same time

00:30:35.00 within a frame shot of each other yeah maybe that's what we need to do how

00:30:37.22 about this Andrew we'll rent a boat you'll be on the boat you operate the

00:30:43.07 phantom right and Geoff and I will cross paths along the wake we'll get air and

00:30:47.17 pass each other in the air oh my god through the frame a jet ski mid-air high

00:30:53.11 five we're gonna die we're gonna you're gonna

00:30:57.01 have to step in and say no like for the sake of my continued job and like you

00:31:02.02 guys not dying or like breaking I have to say no to the midair that there's no

00:31:06.21 way there's no way you're going to die you're going to rip off each other's

00:31:10.12 arms you know what else Eric said in a way about 19.

00:31:14.21 I think we would end up we would end up sat on each other's jet skis facing the

00:31:19.17 wrong way

00:31:21.14 it would be like that episode of bay watch where hulk hogan gets hit by a

00:31:27.11 jet ski and almost dies it needs to be one of you would go down yeah

00:31:33.07 yeah well can't open up card backs with one arm yeah but hulk hogan made it oh

00:31:38.23 hey if hulk hogan can make it we got that going for us that's true wow so

00:31:42.07 that was Eric noping that one all right so we're still we don't know where we

00:31:45.10 stand with the jet ski well we'll we'll we definitely have jet ski uh tricks uh

00:31:49.16 that we can do maybe maybe not the high five maybe we'll work our way up to that

00:31:52.18 you know maybe after we show Eric our skills he'll feel more comfortable maybe

00:31:57.02 you could like an additional input on this Gavin Geoff and I were talking about

00:32:00.21 it I feel like the jet ski entertainment market is pretty shallow I feel like we

00:32:05.04 can move in I feel like it's Kenny powers number one then you think of the

00:32:09.14 guy from tiger king and I don't think I have a clear number three or like I

00:32:14.02 definitely think of this person than a jet ski thing I remember uh vanilla ice

00:32:18.11 being really big into jet skis that being a thing I don't know why I

00:32:21.21 just remember that when I in my head I associate jet skis with vanilla ice I

00:32:25.05 feel like that video of Gavin has already surpassed vanilla ice and the

00:32:29.14 juice for sure we're already on the podium of jet ski known for jet ski

00:32:33.08 content yeah yeah I I think we honestly we should own the podium why do you like

00:32:38.12 that video so much why do I like it or why does it

00:32:42.08 it's just it's a silly it's a silly video it's a dumb thing and also without

00:32:48.02 context I just received that without any point of reference

00:32:52.04 that's the only thing I got it's a good video yeah I'm excited about

00:32:57.07 the future of jet skiing uh I can't wait to kick it up a notch and and and uh

00:33:01.18 start diving into some of the cool [ __ ]

00:33:03.19 we can do also by the way how [ __ ]

00:33:05.14 beautiful is lake Austin and all the houses like

00:33:08.16 when you're when we're not going a thousand miles an hour Andrew there are

00:33:12.05 all these little channels that you can go in off the main lake that are like

00:33:16.04 you can go in on the jet skis like they're like no wake zones so you go

00:33:19.01 real slow but it's through all these like there's like islands where houses

00:33:22.12 are and you go under like covered bridges and there's like crazy [ __ ]

00:33:26.05 mansions and all these beautiful homes yeah there's like side streets

00:33:31.01 on water like you take a little water street off the main lake and then you

00:33:34.09 see a mansion with a volleyball court it's it's a level of wealth that I would

00:33:39.11 describe as absolutely disgusting like filthy levels of wealth on that it's

00:33:44.10 it's mental just to look at the houses on there it's pretty cool I'm excited to

00:33:49.19 film on the back of a boat that I assume is moving very quickly with a very

00:33:54.17 expensive camera based off of your idea yeah I'll give you a sturdy tripod all

00:33:58.15 you gotta do is hit the button when Geoff and I hit the wake and go by each other

00:34:03.08 but how does real life will be like 25

00:34:06.17 feet apart how does a tripod work when the thing it's resting on is shaking

00:34:10.07 violently does that still help uh the boat is bouncing everywhere like I

00:34:15.14 don't think the tripod does anything at that point sandbags bit of rope

00:34:20.19 okay I'm now excited what I have in my head can't be what you possibly think

00:34:24.17 this will look like so I'm just excited to see what your contraption is for how

00:34:29.06 we're gonna stabilize I think if we tie if we tie ropes like boats have metal

00:34:34.05 loops right they have little holes to put ropes through that's that's what

00:34:37.10 comes with the boat you know just wrap that around a tripod have you gotten to

00:34:41.02 a season to survivor where they do the challenge where they have to hold the

00:34:44.00 bar over their shoulders and they add sandbags to it they just keep adding

00:34:47.09 weights that's what I'm imagining your system is for how we're gonna level this

00:34:50.16 I'm just gonna have a bar on my shoulders with a bunch of sandbags

00:34:54.19 attached trying to stabilize for you and you and Geoff to high-five or do it are

00:35:00.10 you a boat guy Andrew no I'm not and I like a

00:35:02.21 you went to boating school well I didn't I didn't go to it the boating school

00:35:06.14 went to my school it came to me I did not go to boat school I was in normal

00:35:10.17 school and they did a whole thing on boats you

00:35:13.08 attended boat school I remember this being a big deal back when you were

00:35:16.09 doing your I attended school and it had a boating section that I was very and

00:35:20.11 kind of tying into something else we talked about before knots is where I

00:35:24.07 fell apart I was so determined the ace boat school are the boating classes and

00:35:28.12 then there was the knot section and it fell apart for me I'm terrible at nuts

00:35:33.10 never good at that not a not guy [Music]

00:35:36.10 I have a uh I have a new this is a little thing but you know I've been

00:35:40.23 thinking about Gavin and collecting and how I have uh

00:35:44.13 all my sports cards and all that nonsense and Andrew you now have your

00:35:47.17 and we haven't really talked about it but your burgeoning love of uh

00:35:50.14 collecting classic video games and uh I think I've landed on I'm gonna

00:35:54.13 put it in the the perfect thing for Gavin to collect

00:35:58.00 I feel like this is going to be insulting I don't think so an egg it's a

00:36:02.02 baseball card of an egg and there's many different kinds this is the Allen and

00:36:06.05 ginter tops 2019 egg card of which there's probably 30 different parallels

00:36:10.12 some are as expensive as a thousand dollars that's the base egg why do you

00:36:15.16 want an egg not a cod why not dude why not love you love eggs is this the

00:36:20.11 reaction that you're expecting Geoff oh 100 yeah

00:36:23.16 and you named my cat you named my cat egg yeah but it's an ow

00:36:28.19 I just don't know where to start like why isn't that one of a kettle why an

00:36:32.20 egg well because this is a famous egg why isn't that one of a wasp nest

00:36:38.06 because that the wasp nest didn't get 30 million likes on Instagram or

00:36:41.12 whatever this is the egg from the the most liked egg on the most like thing on

00:36:45.21 Instagram but why is there god it's like culturally significant so

00:36:50.02 they made a card out of it but there's like many different kinds of that egg

00:36:53.19 god look at this eBay page of all the eggs yeah see oh you could collect all

00:36:57.10 those different eggs eight dollar egg forty dollar egg that one's the top

00:37:00.19 one's a thousand dollar egg five hundred five hundred dollar egg

00:37:04.12 for eight hundred dollars egg you think I should be I should have a

00:37:07.17 dozen eggs but there will be I think you should be an egg man you should have

00:37:10.19 the you should have the collector's dozen all right yeah I'll start this

00:37:14.15 collection oh a grand though that's a lot for a card

00:37:17.08 with a picture of an egg on it well I'll

00:37:19.01 help you get lucky in a pool I feel like

00:37:21.07 the way to do this so I'm trying to like process in my head I think what we do

00:37:24.23 Geoff and I don't want to step in on your idea in any way I think we get a bunch

00:37:30.21 of like egg cartons and we buy a bunch of different various types of eggs that

00:37:34.18 are grated egg cards that are graded Gavin has to pick a carton and he

00:37:39.14 doesn't know where the greatest egg is he can end up with a bunch of rotten

00:37:42.15 eggs he can end up with a bunch of [ __ ] shitty egg cards to get out with

00:37:46.23 a great card I feel like that's the the way to do this

00:37:49.14 instead of just buying every egg so I'm just throwing it out there so

00:37:52.23 that I can miss out on a good egg I want you to potentially open a box of rotten

00:37:57.07 egg carts just like the shittiest egg cards available

00:38:00.23 and then be like oh behind this box is like the psa 10. This is the greatest

00:38:06.00 egg card of all time apparently according to eBay at this moment what a

00:38:11.08 [ __ ] stupid thing to put on a baseball card what else is other than x

00:38:15.08 what else that's not anything to do with baseball if they put on yeah that's a

00:38:19.07 great question I don't know uh I I I really don't Allen and ginter

00:38:23.14 this line they do this kind of [ __ ]

00:38:26.12 every year they um and this is an old this isn't an old egg this is not 29

00:38:30.08 yeah well the egg might be old it's the egg that dethrones stormy jenner on

00:38:35.03 Instagram as the most liked photo why do people care about the egg I don't know

00:38:40.00 okay it's just there has to be a reason I just think it's I just think it's

00:38:44.19 ridiculous and stupid and that if I had to describe Gavin that

00:38:48.13 would be the two words I use.

00:38:51.18 I thought you're going to expand on that I thought you were going to double down

00:38:56.15 on those words you would use oh that's the word

00:39:00.00 and it the egg was originally posted on Instagram as an experiment by an

00:39:04.15 unidentified londoner and the pick soared to 30 million likes

00:39:08.01 so for all I know Gavin you could have been the one that posted the egg in the

00:39:11.08 first place you are also British yeah this is true it could have been that is

00:39:15.09 a fact yeah yeah I can't argue that you are British

00:39:18.17 I think it might be you I think that's the only classification we need that's

00:39:22.19 the all the evidence might have just been identified and he likes eggs and he

00:39:26.00 likes to say the word egg and he named my cat egg once that's true is there a

00:39:31.09 special word for stealing eggs hmm like you don't have like some items

00:39:36.01 it's like it's just called theft but like if you steal an apple it's scrumping

00:39:42.00 I didn't know man no I didn't I didn't know ample had its own thing oh you know

00:39:46.04 why is it grumpy as a child what no what is grumping oh is that is that

00:39:51.01 British thing oh I might find a new English thing

00:39:55.01 what is you mean just like picking apples yeah I'm pretty sure why don't I

00:39:59.06 scrub it I'm pretty sure it just means you've like

00:40:02.08 nicked someone else's apples off that tree the the Cambridge

00:40:06.23 dictionary definition uh is to steal fruit such as apples from trees

00:40:11.18 yeah so we need the what's the egg equivalent of scrumping how do you

00:40:16.12 scrump an egg well hold on let me Google that how do you

00:40:20.17 annoy this no you see you just you said scrumping like it was a legal term like

00:40:26.09 people have gone to jail for scrumping like it is a thing that is tried

00:40:32.17 what am I wrong it's it's it's a name for stealing fruit it is

00:40:37.12 it is a hundred percent a name for stealing fruit did Andrew leave I think

00:40:41.21 we lost him no I'm here can you not hear

00:40:43.19 me we lost you for a second now you lost you for a second

00:40:47.14 what was your response to what am I wrong are you wrong about what I don't

00:40:52.13 understand what you're asking me what happened

00:40:55.21 I feel like I missed your question [Laughter]

00:40:59.08 well you disappeared again what do you mean what was the question

00:41:04.12 sorry I'm reading about other uh words for scrumping I will say if you Google

00:41:09.12 how do you scrump an egg Google responds with uh

00:41:11.23 we think you mean how do you scramble an egg uh in here we'll tell you can the

00:41:16.02 title of this episode be how do you how do you scrump an egg yeah

00:41:24.17 so I didn't know this is puppy nick said humpty dumpty.

00:41:33.18 [Laughter]

00:41:46.10 That's another thing another reason why Gavin should love collecting eggs we had

00:41:52.21 the whole humpty dumpty discussion about like we're becoming a very egg-centric

00:41:58.13 podcast lately we had [ __ ] last time in eggs this time

00:42:03.01 I guess the humpty dumpty thing yeah um Eric says is there a gray area between

00:42:08.13 scrumping and foraging yeah I guess so like if it's not a private tree I assume

00:42:12.14 it's foraging if it's an owned tree or in a

00:42:15.12 if you're trespassing for the apples that's probably scrumping is scrumping a

00:42:19.11 big problem in england I don't know if it's a problem I feel

00:42:22.23 like it's it's just like a light crime that school kids do because it's a

00:42:26.06 little bit cheeky because I assume most people don't give a [ __ ] if you take

00:42:30.04 their bramblies off the tree so in america we have like you'll go buy

00:42:33.02 private property you'll see signs posted and say like posted no trespassing

00:42:37.12 violators will be shot stuff like that do you see

00:42:39.22 do you see in england are there signs on trees that say like uh no scrumping

00:42:45.14 scrumpers will be prosecuted posters will be shot

00:42:49.07 scrubbers will be shot on site I bet I've I think there has been a no

00:42:54.21 scrumping sign at some point we need to make a no scrumping shirt dude

00:42:59.16 that might be if I put a no scrumping sign on my front lawn that would

00:43:04.17 I think that'd be excellent it would be very confusing to a lot of people yeah

00:43:09.15 I'd love to hear what people say we should screw the shirt we should sell no

00:43:14.12 scrumping yard signs that people can post in their yard or their private

00:43:18.08 property I feel like that would be such a

00:43:20.10 stressful thing if you're like okay we got these people we're putting you're in

00:43:24.01 this field okay no scrumping allowed if you you scrump

00:43:27.12 you're out of the game and just seeing what people like have to process what

00:43:31.05 scrumping even means I'd never guess it would be picking apples

00:43:36.03 I love it without the ing like to scrump [Laughter]

00:43:39.11 you see that tree he scrumped it

00:43:49.20 that [ __ ] scrumper with his bag of apples

00:43:56.00 you see all those pies those pies are the product of scrumping [Laughter]

00:44:03.07 got like black market scrumptious I love the idea

00:44:07.11 of a conversation in prison like what are you in for

00:44:12.13 about scrumping grand scrumping I stole an 18 wheeler verse of eggs

00:44:21.20 it's grand scrump larceny what is this Eric scrumping badges

00:44:28.04 oh bad badger scrump probably yeah they're scrumpers instead of like

00:44:32.19 teardrops for kills it's apples for theft for scrubs

00:44:37.18 we should we should just sell uh we should make a shirt that has a badger

00:44:43.02 with the no circle and line around it it just says scrumper at the bottom

00:44:48.04 yeah so I think the next merch meeting should be scrumping scrumper no

00:44:53.06 scrumping oh my god that's great wow well that

00:44:56.19 just landed in our laps that's what I hope the audience sat through the sports

00:45:01.22 portion at the beginning of the podcast to hear this Jesus I did not expect

00:45:08.00 I did not expect that dumb egg baseball card which by the way I bought

00:45:12.17 six weeks ago and I've been meaning to to bring up uh I did not expect it to go

00:45:18.13 the route of scrumping that that what a gift

00:45:20.16 I don't uh it's funny so scrumping can be any tree that's owned like any fruit

00:45:25.11 it doesn't even have to be a tree what if I it's like a bush situation is that

00:45:30.06 scrumping is it stealing the fruit off of a thing that somebody else's owns is

00:45:35.12 that a book called scrumping by harry new house an erotic short story on the

00:45:39.06 consequences of apple thievery oh my god is this on eBay how do we get

00:45:44.02 this yeah it's on amazon it's free on kindle

00:45:47.01 is is the story of Adam and eve a scrump story is that

00:45:51.11 who um what was the tree what do they call the original sin the original scrump

00:45:57.03 Adam and eve is the original scrump that's how it all went wrong oh my god

00:46:02.10 that was the origin of all sin with a cheeky scrub.

00:46:07.11 [Laughter]

00:46:11.05 Original sin is a scrump it's like it's like humanity began

00:46:18.15 according to the bible humanity began with scrumping it's like they say that

00:46:24.14 prostitution is the oldest known uh profession in the world but it's not

00:46:29.11 it's scrumpy I'm just imagining somebody getting

00:46:33.01 pulled over with a giant sack of apples in their backseat sweating [Laughter]

00:46:40.17 you know when like a cop is searching something and they see something of

00:46:45.22 criminal activity and they just grab their gun it's like let's just see if

00:46:49.12 the big crate about yes

00:46:52.12 he like looks at it you're going pretty fast there man

00:46:56.11 everything okay and be like yeah sorry I didn't realize I'm speeding he sees the

00:46:59.12 bag of apples in the back and he just touches ma'am that goes ma'am I need to

00:47:03.03 get out of the car right now the car right hands on the car hands on the car

00:47:06.04 they drove by a cop car like the lights are on yet they just see it on the side

00:47:08.12 of the road pour the apples out pour the apples out they're just throwing apples

00:47:11.19 on them [Laughter]

00:47:16.13 we should oh my god we should read this story we should do like a pod we should

00:47:22.05 do like a face uh shoulder episode where we just read the scrumping

00:47:26.12 story yes for the audience I think that's good and

00:47:30.02 this is maybe something to do after the jet ski stunt oh yes a scrumped pie

00:47:35.11 holy [ __ ] I never viewed eating a pie as

00:47:39.08 potentially a criminal offense this has changed my life dramatically

00:47:44.15 scrumping wow oh man I feel like I learned so much today I've been an

00:47:49.00 educational [Laughter]

00:47:51.03 [ __ ] one how many bullets do you have left Andrew

00:47:54.19 I s well for like things for us to talk about are my best yeah I think I got my

00:48:00.09 five my top I have one it's kind of a bigger thing that we talked about I feel

00:48:04.00 like yeah I feel like I'm the only one that

00:48:06.03 also did the homework on that side well I I have I have a I you know I worked

00:48:10.14 you're not the only one who did the homework I have an angle there that I'd

00:48:14.02 like to explore explore but I don't think we have time to get into the

00:48:17.01 superhero thing and Gavin I don't think we've talked to you about that at all

00:48:21.07 have we no we did uh briefly on text briefly on text okay yeah uh I'll say

00:48:25.19 this I uh I survived survivor I finally finished the 21 seasons now I'm in a

00:48:31.00 living in a post-survivor world that's kind of cool damn you sped up I'm still

00:48:35.12 in like 38. So you're not going to watch the earlier ones I will I mean I

00:48:39.10 finished it I wanted to get through it so that I could watch the new one and be

00:48:42.19 all caught up so I watched seasons 20

00:48:45.11 through 40.

00:48:47.01 When does 41 start like at the end of the month September 22nd I think or 26th

00:48:52.10 one of those days yeah it's end of the month should we try and get probes done

00:48:56.04 oh yeah absolutely he could be our first guest.

00:49:00.19 I don't know what I'd ask Probst what would you ask for

00:49:05.07 does anybody tell us about the school what kind of scrumping goes on behind

00:49:09.09 the scenes that we don't know about are they struggling right fruit from a

00:49:13.00 tree in that show it's not scrumping because nobody owns that you'd assume

00:49:17.05 right assume that's just beach that's just all the all the bread fruit uh is

00:49:21.12 uh is fair game for them yes we could we could take on the responsibility of

00:49:26.01 reporting all global scrumping because I I can't imagine it comes up in the news

00:49:29.23 that often but if it does we should I feel like we could report that has

00:49:34.02 anyone been to the listeners what's the biggest consequence to a scrumper

00:49:39.05 well we need to read that erotic novel it's probably anal we'll find out that

00:49:43.04 apparently was about the consequences I feel like we're gonna get six pages

00:49:48.04 into that thing and go like this was a huge mistake we cannot do this

00:49:52.04 well we'll need to see if we have the rights to do it if we can legally do it

00:49:55.10 but if we can I think we have to although the comment levers are welcome

00:49:59.10 to tell us not to if they don't want to hear it where does copyright like are we

00:50:03.20 worried about copyright because it will get detected or like could I play

00:50:07.15 a snippet of an audio commentary on a movie or is that not allowed Eric

00:50:11.22 that's that's not allowed audio stuff is pretty cut and dry but as far as

00:50:15.06 intellectual property I've been looking it up as far as intellectual property

00:50:18.10 for uh like an audiobook style situation where we're reading something

00:50:23.18 I think we can do it and also we should just do it wow

00:50:28.08 there you go eric's usually the no absolutely not guy that was a yes from

00:50:33.11 the producer we have to do it I love this idea I think we're gonna get three

00:50:36.18 paid I think Andrew said six pages I think we're getting three pages in and

00:50:40.10 going what I'm not reading this anymore I think that's what's going to happen

00:50:44.10 where do the apples go I guess we'll find out

00:50:48.02 I'm reading a story about scrumping look at these [ __ ] criminals look at these

00:50:53.16 [ __ ] criminals went off that looks like a job for the

00:50:58.01 Vancouver child kicker no

00:51:01.03 looks like a full on heist he could scrump that real fast.

00:51:07.12 I feel like that would oh you'd get such good air [Laughter]

00:51:14.08 if mid-scrump I mean specifically just an observation.

00:51:23.20 I'm just thinking please stop kicking children and I've

00:51:27.23 never I would never I want to be very clear I don't endorse it don't do it

00:51:32.17 I've never done it I wouldn't I would never you we've seen the it looks okay

00:51:38.04 like you this is what I didn't say at that time okay and you this is I feel

00:51:42.16 like a key piece of information that will maybe change your views on that story

00:51:47.12 I had just seen it follows within like the last few days I feel like that's a

00:51:52.01 big shift that's a movie all about the demon thing can shape into whatever it

00:51:56.17 can look like anything yeah but at this point it wasn't

00:51:59.12 following it was approaching the movie's not called it approaches what do you

00:52:02.16 mean if you're following you approach you certainly are approaching while

00:52:05.15 following it's following you behind like

00:52:08.00 when you follow someone you're following behind them you were turned right they

00:52:11.07 were facing it I they were following like when I turned they were walking

00:52:15.12 towards that's fair yeah how how close did this person get within I would say

00:52:20.12 six feet they were probably okay so there was six feet from the at which

00:52:25.11 foot marker would you have deployed the kick I would have deployed it

00:52:29.22 probably at a dinklage and a half okay I would have taken a step forward I I

00:52:35.12 was giving plenty of warnings I'm so I really I do feel like my life would have

00:52:39.23 dramatically shifted if I kicked that kid I'm so glad I didn't yeah yeah I

00:52:45.11 think he was six feet away you must have been

00:52:47.18 two feet from kick that was very close but it was within seven seconds of

00:52:52.10 something happening I would say I gave so many warning I was trying to talk it

00:52:57.12 was very scary it was an intimidating situation

00:53:00.00 I just love that he's six feet away and he's still somehow a silhouette you had

00:53:04.01 no information of his face I feel like we moved four feet walking backwards and

00:53:08.10 I never saw anything that looked like a face at all it was just dark outline the

00:53:12.21 entire move I have never seen this before in my life

00:53:16.21 but this is fascinating my two dogs are I just looked out the window both of my

00:53:21.14 dogs are started perpend like next to each other

00:53:24.10 perfectly taking a dump at the exact same time what's the latest on the ship

00:53:28.12 three three inches apart from each other they're like it's like synchronized

00:53:31.22 [ __ ]

00:53:31.22 That's so cool they don't even like each

00:53:34.10 other but they [ __ I together that's so neat

00:53:36.14 how's the what's it has the what now well have you had any uh bad bad dog

00:53:41.16 [ __ ] experience oh nah man life's been pretty [ __ ] free for me lately uh

00:53:46.14 knock on wood um nothing like after that doorknob fell off I haven't really had

00:53:51.18 any house problems as of late knocking on wood again um

00:53:56.17 dogs are fine knocking on wood yeah it's uh it's uh something about you

00:54:02.00 going out of the country um makes my problems go too interesting well I'll

00:54:07.09 take another trip we'll test it out well just don't do it on [ __ ]

00:54:11.18 Thursdays because I don't want to skip another episode sorry to

00:54:15.09 to interject randomly I'm reading a story right now of somebody who was

00:54:19.04 charged with scrumping there's somebody has been there's been a charge filed

00:54:23.10 against someone so the word scrumping was on the legal documents on the legal

00:54:28.04 documents goff had been charged with scrumping in

00:54:31.18 the back garden of a house in black gaiden south Hampton southampton

00:54:36.17 b-I-e-c-h-y-d-e-n uh magistrates taking the case of the

00:54:40.22 town's petty sessions on august 5th 1868

00:54:43.08 were not merciful sentencing him to seven days hard labor with a warning

00:54:48.04 that if he offended he would probably be whipped there was a serious

00:54:52.13 what year was this it was in 1868 august 5th 1868.

00:54:58.04 No this is just eric's asking if this is from the book we're going to read no

00:55:03.01 this is just a news story I pulled up and where was that from the daily echo

00:55:07.22 dot co dot uk no I mean okay so it was it was in the uk yeah

00:55:11.18 this is why we [ __ ] got that's why we got the [ __ ] out of there this the

00:55:15.09 draconian scrumping laws america we're like we start our own company and that's

00:55:19.07 our own country and that's why I had never heard nor had Eric or nick ever

00:55:23.23 heard of scrumping because we escaped scrumping tyranny when we left england

00:55:29.11 that makes sense get away from me I feel like this will stand now as

00:55:33.16 the most mentions of the word scrump in any piece of media of all time I

00:55:38.13 don't think this could be beaten we're taking the scrump podium and we're gonna

00:55:42.23 put will it we'll put it right next to our uh to our jet ski podium

00:55:46.10 absolutely I have two more things to say

00:55:48.13 two points that I want to close out okay they're very dated right now take it

00:55:52.10 away people have asked how I did with my

00:55:55.12 olympic bets we haven't recorded since I guess we did the last one but I went 11

00:56:01.03 out of 16 just to clear that up and the second thing I want to say

00:56:05.12 is I heard yesterday I found out I do not listen to these uh that

00:56:10.04 the plan to order the ice cream came during the chaos that was me getting the

00:56:14.17 first order and I just want to say I respect the move I thought that was a

00:56:18.21 free plan I also want to say Geoff I think you

00:56:22.06 ordered me more ice cream than you anticipated you sent me a giant

00:56:26.03 two-liter tub of banana ice cream yeah I'm not 70

00:56:29.17 yeah I said I tried to send you like a hundred dollars worth of ice cream I

00:56:34.00 assumed it was a lot you sent me a double tub of banana and you sent me a

00:56:38.13 small tub of banana and so I didn't I say you cookie dough too right because

00:56:43.04 you don't like it you I didn't I remembered you saying that you think

00:56:46.23 something like cookie dough yeah is the ice cream that people think they like

00:56:49.03 but then when they have it it's not as good as they think or something so I

00:56:52.02 tried yeah to load you up heavy on that one no I well the thing is I flipped on

00:56:56.08 that I actually like cookie dough now I've reversed that opinion I enjoyed

00:56:59.13 that you got me bubbling on my ice cream too which is fine but it was more of an

00:57:03.06 issue of you got this big tube and you got the little tube and I opened the

00:57:06.12 first ice cream I tried was the banana ice cream and I'm like Geoff loves banana

00:57:10.09 flavor this makes sense I've never had banana ice cream it's fine I wouldn't

00:57:15.07 eat this regularly I thought I would whatever I I was I bet you would adore

00:57:20.03 this [ __ ] ice cream I I had it I'm like I'm not gonna throw this away it's

00:57:23.12 not that big of a container I'll just eat this across time it's fine

00:57:28.06 and then I open the big container [Music]

00:57:31.09 and my realization that this was an even bigger tub of banana ice cream was just

00:57:37.20 filled with disappointment I was so excited of like I got four

00:57:40.23 flavors and they're mystery I don't know what they are where half of it was just

00:57:45.11 banana ice cream oh that makes my heart happy oh that's yeah

00:57:49.09 have you eat have you gone through all the ice cream yet

00:57:52.10 uh I've I ate the cookie dough I have gotten rid of the majority of the banana

00:57:57.12 ice cream I've tried I did my best it's just too much

00:58:01.04 and uh I still have I didn't really touch the bubble gum how about all the

00:58:05.00 uh how about all the sweets and pastries oh yeah those are long you can't you

00:58:08.14 can't they don't yeah they don't hold my favorite part of that is when you

00:58:13.16 stormed off the second time I was referring you came you you were mad

00:58:17.04 leaving because at this point it was it was a bit was old to you it was very

00:58:21.07 inconvenient I just like how you came back the second time and I could almost

00:58:25.18 picture you like smiling through your teeth you're like

00:58:28.14 thanks for the ice cream

00:58:32.00 even if you know you're annoyed you said thanks we just wanted we just wanted to

00:58:36.17 celebrate your birthday man here this is what I'm excited about Gavin

00:58:41.20 I talked to you about an idea I had relating to Geoff

00:58:44.21 before that that sort of connects to this do you remember that no

00:58:49.05 I talked to you about a thing I'm just I'll quickly I'll text you what it is

00:58:55.11 okay and what Geoff did just locked in that I'm going to now do

00:58:59.07 that so I'm going to send you quick text just to get your reaction looking at my

00:59:04.17 phone yep sending it right now uh so I that's something that we talked about

00:59:10.05 before that happened now this is just like it's an absolute

00:59:15.12 there's going to be a guarantee 100 it better we better be able to put it on a

00:59:20.07 t-shirt yeah I think we can okay okay the last thing I sent you were we're

00:59:24.22 doing stuff with so I think oh my god god how cool does that look by the way

00:59:29.01 yeah it's awesome should we say I didn't want to say it because yeah no that's

00:59:32.19 fine I think we can okay yeah we're doing like pink port a potty mugs like

00:59:36.19 tiki mug things I guess yeah yeah they look awesome they look really cool they

00:59:40.21 look very cool I don't know when those will come out but they look great I

00:59:44.10 think it's been a whole thing like they should have been out already but we got

00:59:47.16 our sample back from the vendor and it wasn't up to standard so we switched

00:59:50.18 vendors and it's been a whole thing but it's I know the merge department's been

00:59:54.08 working on it diligently in the background great should we wrap this up yeah

00:59:59.14 yeah once again I feel like we all have so

01:00:02.05 much stuff to talk about and it's a time issue and it's the issue of I feel like

01:00:05.15 none of us want to really engage in the thing because we don't have time but we

01:00:09.17 still have a lot yeah we still have a big thing it's the thing I feared of

01:00:13.07 having so much that we can't talk about it that's okay because we can talk about

01:00:18.02 it next Thursday when we record another episode of face
