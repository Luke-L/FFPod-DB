00:00:25.05 [Music]

00:00:32.10 Hello and welcome to another episode of the F**kFuckFacePodcast this is episode 69

00:00:38.17 uh no importance to that number really it's just the one that follows episode

00:00:44.08 68 comes right before 70. Uh with me as always Andrew panton from Canada Gavin

00:00:50.08 free from england Eric bader from the land of san Diego uh nick Schwartz I

00:00:55.07 don't know where nick nick is from uh Austin Texas I've decided and I am uh

00:01:00.08 mobile Alabama and together every week we sit down and we talk about uh tarot

00:01:07.07 cards and tarot card readings yeah Andrew you were saying well I was just

00:01:12.11 we talked about we have that rookie of the year bet and I had somebody reach

00:01:16.02 out a long time ago uh back when we're talking about doing it with basketball

00:01:20.07 and I'd been meaning to email them and they reached out over twitter last night

00:01:25.07 about the bets and being willing to help send some some positive magic towards

00:01:29.06 the players of our choice and part of that was I got to have a tarot card

00:01:33.00 reading on the back got to kind of get an analysis of how things are going to

00:01:36.19 go essentially from my memory uh the first card I got said that my my

00:01:41.14 strengths are in my ambition and sneakiness but it may cause resentment and uh

00:01:48.10 strike is the may just strike through the word may

00:01:51.20 yeah so this and the second card was like I'm holding on to the pass which

00:01:57.20 could could be bad bets lost in the past which is

00:02:01.09 path of gambling if not 80 percent it's like that's all gambling is is you

00:02:05.13 having regret about things you've done I

00:02:07.22 don't remember I think the third one was like success would come from teamwork

00:02:12.00 and something I don't remember how it worked exactly

00:02:16.10 like this team like face I mean you could interpret that in so many ways

00:02:19.14 maybe the success of of justifiables is in his teamwork or or the players we're

00:02:24.21 gonna pick but essentially I opted I had to make a choice because the

00:02:28.17 interpretation was that the magic would be most powerful if focused on only one

00:02:34.08 person but I didn't want to risk the resentfulness that may come with that

00:02:38.13 so I put everything on Geoff and my player and Gavin I didn't send anything

00:02:42.02 your way because I figured you're naturally lucky enough you don't need it

00:02:46.10 it's true mac Jones is going to be poor Matt Jones he's not going to be

00:02:49.22 as well no you don't I I love that you remember how to say his last name I got

00:02:56.00 told by Eric I think what you need to evaluate Gavin

00:02:59.17 is your natural luck opposed to my bad luck that the magic needs to counter

00:03:04.06 it's a much deeper hole for the magic to take effect on myself I don't think I

00:03:09.11 have good luck I think I have luck boosters like if your luck is bad I'll

00:03:14.15 make it worse as I've seen wherever I'm wherever I'm deciding what you bet

00:03:18.22 I'm like a like a luck catalyst

00:03:21.14 it's true I don't think I've ever won based off of advice given by you and

00:03:27.00 we've done this on the show and off the show

00:03:31.05 I think I'm like oh and seven based upon gavin's guidance

00:03:35.12 eventually you should just go in on like a million dollar bet because if you if

00:03:40.12 you've lost 10 times you can't lose 11.

00:03:43.00 Sure that's that is such a gambler's mentality that is completely wrong and I

00:03:47.09 love I completely agree with it cannot possibly be read again oh it's red well

00:03:52.21 it can't there's no way it will be read one more time man

00:03:57.02 I know there's only there's only so many face hours in a face day

00:04:02.04 yeah uh but I would love some shoulder content for this podcast that you

00:04:07.00 getting your tarot reading recorded oh well it's already the tarot's done

00:04:10.19 already I'm gonna get I can always do it

00:04:13.05 again we get like I just think that that like especially in the context of this

00:04:17.03 bet I almost feel like we should have all three of us do tarot readings and

00:04:20.02 have them have them be recorded to the audience yeah well this is scary

00:04:24.15 territory buddy we're dealing with we're

00:04:28.06 dealing with the dark arts my first ever terror reading the very first card that

00:04:32.03 I ever like I don't even know the cards at this point hold the card death

00:04:36.17 that's not that I was told that it's not actually that bad and you don't want to

00:04:40.19 pull the tower [ __ I that's a bad card that's not a

00:04:44.07 bad card that's just changed buddy the tower the tower is a bad card

00:04:48.17 for sure that's the one you don't know I

00:04:51.03 feel like the death card is like the ace of a blackjack card like the equivalent

00:04:55.16 of it's very powerful or useless like it could be an 11 which could be

00:04:59.14 very useful to you as long as the death isn't pointed at you that's a powerful

00:05:04.00 card I mean I don't understand terror works but I don't think death

00:05:07.04 necessarily is a bad thing it's not it really isn't in in the tarot world

00:05:12.04 oh man well yeah I mean it's all [ __ ] in general isn't it none of it's

00:05:17.06 bad it's it's paper well do you say that now but let's just

00:05:21.09 say this bet yeah exactly we're gonna get one I'm the James randy of this

00:05:25.14 podcast well I'm I'm glad that I didn't put any magic towards you it would have

00:05:29.05 been a waste it would have been a waste on you Andrew I was right all along yes

00:05:32.18 Geoff can I see a question this is not for you please do not

00:05:36.13 participate in this portion Andrew do you know who James randy is

00:05:40.20 yes yes who is he he is a I believe he's a skeptic right generally speaking

00:05:45.21 he's somebody who has debunked several people he used to work on the tonight

00:05:49.10 show a lot where he'd come on and like debunk people that claim that they had

00:05:53.04 psychic abilities he's a very good I think he's also a magician maybe yeah he

00:05:58.19 was like the great randy but I guess uh when origella came on the the talk show

00:06:04.06 was it Carson at the time asked uh James randy how to mess with gela's

00:06:09.16 like spoon so he deliberately didn't have and he

00:06:12.23 didn't allow the crew of Yuri geller to get anywhere near all the props

00:06:18.13 for like 20 minutes trying to bend the spoon but because he couldn't he didn't

00:06:24.01 pre-bend any of them he couldn't do it but it somehow made someone made arigela

00:06:28.19 even more famous and it didn't tank his career in any way it's very interesting

00:06:32.20 I feel like there's a clip of randy on like a show and it was a guy claiming

00:06:36.21 that he could move things with his mind and he's gonna like open a phone book or

00:06:40.07 like change the page of a phone book but really he was just blowing on him yeah

00:06:44.04 he's like essentially either blowing or like directing the the wind of the room

00:06:48.16 like he was just it was clearly like he's just using the effect I think he

00:06:51.18 was blowing as you said so randy put all these [ __ ] little pieces of paper

00:06:57.09 around it so it couldn't just yeah couldn't just move the thing it's great

00:07:02.21 and the guy is like hmm yeah I can't I can't do it now for some reason

00:07:06.12 or something there's a lot of strategic squatting by that guy in that video of

00:07:11.00 like trying to get into the zone like pretending he's like trying to get the

00:07:14.15 right he's dressed like a martial artist he is yeah I forgot about that but yeah

00:07:19.03 I'm very familiar with him he's great I've never heard of the guy that's funny

00:07:22.08 that's interesting is he British or American no he died recently he did but

00:07:26.21 did he die British or American he was Americans of america

00:07:31.11 I don't know maybe American I don't know

00:07:34.07 actually I just know he's not British is actually the answer to that question I

00:07:36.13 don't know anything beyond that

00:07:40.02 oh eric's typing Canadian American well there we go we're both right in the in

00:07:45.04 the world of solving things I want to talk about a thing really quickly

00:07:48.09 because the the episode we recorded last week the first one aired and which I

00:07:52.16 talked about my shift key realization oh yeah I didn't know that shift could

00:07:56.02 capitalize a lot of people talking about it everything they don't believe that

00:07:59.14 that was a thing that I could do and so I I was fascinated because I

00:08:03.16 genuinely didn't know that that the shift capitalization was a thing and how

00:08:08.19 is this possible and Gavin you brought up

00:08:10.20 the phone the phone has the symbol for it which I didn't really understand so

00:08:15.22 I'm gonna I'll pull up tablet get this ready so I

00:08:19.19 that is only useful if you know that the shift key is supposed to capitalize

00:08:24.14 right so if you have no basis of that even if the symbol is the same that

00:08:29.16 doesn't mean anything I always interpreted that symbol as

00:08:33.18 it's an uppercase like it's going to uppercase your letters so that's my

00:08:38.15 phone keyboard it's not one to one to my real keyboard

00:08:42.14 so there's I didn't view so people have said like oh it well the symbols on the

00:08:47.14 [ __ ] keyboard how did you not make that connection I've used mac keyboards

00:08:53.03 almost my entire life there's no symbol on the shift key that symbol's not there

00:08:57.00 I don't use a pc keyboard so you're saying you didn't know that was shift

00:09:00.13 even though I had no idea that was [ __ ]

00:09:03.01 so the you've been using the shift key this

00:09:05.17 entire time you just didn't understand that it was no no the only time I would

00:09:09.20 use shift I believe is ctrl shift 4

00:09:12.00 where you can then search for a specific word

00:09:15.09 but I'm saying people saying like you Gavin that symbol represents shift not

00:09:19.02 on any keyboard I've ever used but you have to it's in the same place like you

00:09:23.18 have to go there to hit a capital letter what do you mean like what's next to z

00:09:28.15 on a keyboard on e on both keyboards yeah but it [ __ ] but I'd had no idea

00:09:32.12 that shift capitalized I've only been using cap lock and there's not a cap lock

00:09:37.03 button on the phone keyboard so I interpreted the up as the caps locks

00:09:41.12 button not the shift button because that symbol means nothing and I thought the

00:09:45.14 upward arrow was like we're upper casing your letters it is

00:09:49.15 saying it's upper casing your letters yeah so that's just that I just want to

00:09:53.15 know my point is you you've been upper casing your letters with the shift

00:09:57.17 button on your phone this entire time you just not knowing it was a shift yeah

00:10:01.18 you just I just said yes I thought that that was a caps lock

00:10:05.00 button because I didn't know the shift did that you might be right well I mean

00:10:08.19 to be fair they're built into each other like that that is actually both keys on

00:10:13.04 the phone yeah if you double tap it it locks that was what I didn't realize um

00:10:17.11 I think on the podcast we realized that I didn't understand that you could

00:10:20.21 double tap the shift to caps lock and I was manually

00:10:24.10 like holding it holding it down each time I needed to type an all caps word

00:10:29.17 did you know Andrew that if you double tap it locks in the caps I know I had no

00:10:35.05 idea okay if you knew that I was going to say I

00:10:38.05 mean technically you're kind of correct because it it serves the function of

00:10:42.01 shift and caps lock and so this entire time if you've been using it as the caps

00:10:45.13 lock you've been using it correctly I guess so you can tell all the comment

00:10:49.02 levers uh that you were right and they were wrong I'm not it's not even a right

00:10:52.14 or wrong it's more just how did I not make this connection before and I saw a

00:10:57.03 lot of people bringing up the symbol being oh the shift key and it's not for

00:11:00.19 my keyboard I got an earful from minor league fan jack just this morning about

00:11:05.03 I was gonna say the same yeah he's he's Andrew your biggest doubter he

00:11:09.16 pulled me aside when I came into work yesterday and he was like so that shift

00:11:13.12 thing's [ __ ] right like there's no way and I was like look I think I think

00:11:18.21 it's real I don't I would have gone on I what I'm curious

00:11:22.17 about is how long it would have taken me

00:11:25.11 to ever realize that the only reason why I figured out the shift thing because I

00:11:28.19 was talking to someone and I was like don't you hate when you cap lock and you

00:11:32.15 hit the wrong like it's out of sequence so the first letter's small and all the

00:11:36.17 other ones are are capitalized and they explain to me they're like they

00:11:40.15 said you don't use the shift and I had no idea

00:11:42.17 no [ __ ] clue it's just something I didn't learn I don't know how I didn't

00:11:45.16 learn that the shift didn't I don't have an answer for that but I genuinely had

00:11:49.03 no idea that if you held shift to capitalize letters well I mean there's

00:11:52.12 also a way around your problem too in what way like when you're Jesus like uh

00:11:56.23 when you're out of sync like you can uh what is it it's like shift in

00:12:01.04 f3 or something and it like flips the capitalization of all the letters that's

00:12:05.00 not real I think it's real is it is it shift f3 oh so something it's I used to

00:12:09.18 use it in word I guess I don't I know one keyboard

00:12:13.06 shortcut and it's ctrl shift four outside of that I'm never using that

00:12:17.22 shift button dude you should you should give shift a

00:12:21.06 spin it is awesome I tried like once I heard I'm still caps locking because it

00:12:24.21 just feels more natural because I've been typing by hitting capslock on the

00:12:28.12 singular capitalization for most of my life I guess all my life that I've been

00:12:32.03 typing I'll say this you figured out how to play how to use a

00:12:35.21 video game controller wrong and you're way better than I am at video games so

00:12:39.11 I'm not going to judge how you do it yeah that was another weird thing where

00:12:42.12 I didn't realize that there was another way to hold the controller it just

00:12:45.17 seemed obvious that you would do that yeah it blew my mind when you're like no

00:12:50.10 I have both thumbs on the analog sticks wait what he's a claw guy

00:12:54.17 I guess it's called the claw I didn't realize that until after I I used it so

00:12:58.21 you're like fingers on analog stick yeah well I guess I have my my thumbs

00:13:03.07 are on the analog stick and then I bend my finger to cover all the buttons I

00:13:06.08 guess the issue is more that Geoff removes the ability to look around like

00:13:10.14 when you hit a button he uses his thumb so then you can't move your head and

00:13:14.13 shooters so I just bend my finger over to cover

00:13:17.16 all the buttons so I never have to yeah that's why yeah

00:13:21.07 you can avoid that actually with the uh the paddles now on the elite controllers

00:13:24.12 that's the thing I own an elite controller but I never use the paddles

00:13:28.02 because I already just do that with my fingers I don't have much of a use for

00:13:31.17 the paddle system I don't like those paddles it's over

00:13:34.12 complicated and if you slam your controller down they fly off that's how

00:13:38.05 I feel about the shift [Laughter]

00:13:41.04 shift doesn't go anywhere buddy no it doesn't it stays on it's not like

00:13:46.03 that game we have to put the symbols in before it explodes I'd love if keyboards

00:13:49.20 did that but I just the point of it's over

00:13:51.23 complicated in my head I just hit the caps lock key then I hit it again it's

00:13:55.12 not a big deal I just wanted describing how you're just describing something

00:13:59.12 more complicated because you have to do two things that's fun who doesn't like

00:14:03.07 hitting a button I love hitting a button I'm just I'm gonna go on record Andrew

00:14:08.09 and say that I believe you uh even though not many of the comment levers

00:14:12.09 and certainly not minor league jack do uh I think that you're being uh totally

00:14:16.21 honest and I can see how it would happen as someone who's still you know who

00:14:21.11 still has the the roman numeral problem I completely and totally uh can see how

00:14:25.11 how you would uh mis miss this little bit of information and then you look up

00:14:29.03 and it's so many years later and you beat all of crackdown without autolock

00:14:33.03 yeah I I didn't know about this roman numeral

00:14:36.20 problem that you have until last week it's been a big deal my whole life

00:14:41.00 but why don't you just sit down and learn them for like an hour I tried I

00:14:44.12 told you I don't think I don't know if I told you this or if I mentioned it I

00:14:47.11 feel like I've talked about the roman numeral issues so many times it's it's

00:14:50.16 over talked but uh across podcasts and stuff but I used to have a laminated

00:14:55.22 card in my wallet that I could use as a quick reference I mean

00:15:00.19 really you only need to know between 1

00:15:04.07 and 12. Then every anything else is [ __ ] really I mean until you get to

00:15:08.17 the super bowl yeah the super bowl.

00:15:15.05 I bet I like college football better than pro football

00:15:19.03 subconsciously because of the super bowl confuses me there's no there's no roman

00:15:24.12 numerals in college football I like it's the least important detail

00:15:28.13 though of the super bowl [Music]

00:15:30.17 is it I think it is the number of which one it

00:15:34.02 is I think it's important to know when it is yeah

00:15:36.20 like what super bowl it is I don't feel well

00:15:40.06 I guess you could make an argument for that but I feel like I is not a number

00:15:45.18 if somebody b is not a number oh it's a number yes I was a number

00:15:49.20 somebody says like I lv1 I won't know what that means but if they're like the

00:15:55.09 the chiefs patriot super bowl I will know what that is what annoys me about

00:16:00.21 roman numerals is the imbalance around a letter so like a four will be like iv

00:16:06.11 like one before the five and then you have five and then you have five I

00:16:11.20 and then also five I and then five I I like why isn't it

00:16:16.08 two either side it said it's one one way and three the other yeah

00:16:21.08 stupid it's pretty mental it does it's too confusing for a fully formed adult

00:16:27.06 brain to work out they need they need to get you in the third grade when you

00:16:30.15 still haven't fight you still haven't cemented all those connections when you

00:16:34.08 when you're still moldable because now I can't it's nonsense let's just I had a

00:16:39.09 friend at school who thought he'd only read it he'd never seen it

00:16:44.00 allowed he thought the guy's name was Henry ville but it was Henry viii

00:16:54.02 oh man Gavin I ran into you by the way this is

00:16:58.04 getting weird I ran into you at the office this morning where I was

00:17:03.07 going to record my audio only podcast that I do that's not this one and then

00:17:08.08 we we said hi to each other and then we agreed to hang out later when we both

00:17:14.01 leave work to come home to record this audio only podcast well we can't record

00:17:19.12 in person without Andrew because of the imbalance I agree with that and also uh

00:17:25.12 I don't know man I do like even if I could at work I I really I feel in my

00:17:30.06 zone here for this podcast you know I feel safe

00:17:34.02 I've got all my got my treasures around me I've got all my trinkets

00:17:37.09 got all my baseball cards got my egg card I'm ready to go.

00:17:43.18 I uh I feel like you also just need that

00:17:47.01 environment because it's such a big part of the show it took forever to build

00:17:50.17 your moving episodes because of it hitting your head on the desk

00:17:55.09 yeah that's a good point it is funny though to run into Gavin at work and

00:18:00.14 then agree to go home so we can work yeah you you joined us while we were

00:18:05.12 scooting around on our various dude and one wheels

00:18:09.05 two days in a row I've come into the office now that the world is you know

00:18:12.16 we're starting to emerge from our from our pandemic caves and uh two days in a

00:18:17.12 row I've run in I've been at the office and seen you at the office and for a

00:18:20.19 brief moment I almost felt like we worked for a real company again

00:18:25.12 yeah and then I got my bicycle and I rode home

00:18:28.01 we did a pretty good prank on the meeting you were in yesterday yeah

00:18:31.11 that's good very very can we tell yeah this hasn't come out for a while right

00:18:35.14 yeah this will be two weeks from now yeah over a week we

00:18:40.04 were in uh we were in a meeting uh who cares it's I I like this podcast better

00:18:43.20 than whatever that was anyway uh.

00:18:50.00 I uh and plus I created that other thing too so I call I can call seniority and

00:18:55.02 say it makes more sense to be here uh we were in a meeting about ah just like a

00:18:59.18 [ __ ] you know admin meeting kind of stuff and we had minor league fan

00:19:04.10 jacking to talk about this charity that he runs every November that raises a

00:19:08.05 bunch of money for sick kids and uh we're in there for about 3040 minutes

00:19:11.23 he was supposed to come in and talk for about five minutes it it ran about 40

00:19:15.17 minutes of just you know oh yeah uh good lord and and then when he finally gets

00:19:20.07 up to leave it's a glass office on three

00:19:22.12 I guess on two walls the other two walls are solid but the glass is frosted so

00:19:27.07 you kind of you kind of you know you can see

00:19:29.04 colors and shapes but you can't really see what's going on and we were just

00:19:32.20 focused on the charity and all the important work that we were doing and uh

00:19:36.23 minor league fan jack gets up and the door opens you know he opens up the door

00:19:41.12 to walk out and walks right into a giant fridge you guys had moved an entire

00:19:45.12 refrigerator perfectly in front of the door and so that he just walked right

00:19:49.09 into it it was very the fridge is on wheels yeah we're back

00:19:52.23 in the mode of just like videos this is what we missed being at home really

00:19:56.02 videos just can spontaneously happen we're making a video about something

00:19:59.02 else and then I decided to try and move the fridge and then I thought it'd be a

00:20:02.21 good idea to block the door with it and yeah it was very enjoyable

00:20:06.15 and then we we replaced the real fridge with Matt

00:20:10.08 we just gave him all this stuff from the fridge and he had to give it out to

00:20:15.02 people if they wanted to drink it

00:20:18.00 but in that meeting Gavin when we ran into each other you mentioned that you

00:20:22.01 had a bunch of stuff to talk about today really oh no I got some stuff left over

00:20:26.10 I checked out some new stuff I I had one of those

00:20:29.00 moments again where you sort of think you're in a simulation because there's

00:20:32.20 just too much coincidence happening online yeah yeah

00:20:36.17 meg was streaming the other night she was playing some Nancy drew game

00:20:41.06 and because we've been watching so much survivor we haven't really had a chance

00:20:44.17 to watch movies recently so I thought oh watch a movie but she she had to finish

00:20:48.08 that game she wanted to like get through the whole thing and by the time she

00:20:51.07 finished it was quite late so I thought well let's watch like a you know like a

00:20:55.06 90-minute comedy or something we settled on airplane which I hadn't seen in a

00:20:58.19 long time great movie and I was talking to her before I was

00:21:01.23 like oh so you actually had to like finish that game you couldn't just like

00:21:05.20 do it in segments you're like no it's better if you finish it because it's

00:21:09.01 like a murder mystery and and she was like you know what Nancy drew is I was

00:21:10.08 like no I don't I don't really know about Nancy drew and she's like well

00:21:13.17 it's like the hardy boys I was like yeah I don't know I just I'll be honest the

00:21:16.23 only reason I've heard of that is because

00:21:19.23 coolio rapped about it in the Keenan and kell

00:21:23.14 and she was like you're having a laugh you must you must know I was like no

00:21:27.09 seriously that's the only reason I know those names then we're watching um

00:21:31.09 airplane and there's that scene in the cockpit where like everyone has a

00:21:34.12 confusing name for a cockpit so you've got like captain over you've got someone

00:21:38.12 called roger yeah someone else called victor and they're like what's your

00:21:41.18 vector victor he's like uh you're over what roger rogers like her and it's just

00:21:46.12 all that confusing stuff and meg's like oh they're doing like a funny uh

00:21:51.04 costello bit yeah I was like oh I've never

00:21:54.07 seen any of that she's like oh you know I think I haven't got Stella and I was

00:21:57.17 like

00:22:05.05 because coolio rapped about it

00:22:09.20 where he goes through double x so then she was like all right you have enough

00:22:15.09 you're having a laugh now

00:22:18.00 so that I got up the lyrics to Keenan and kel and I was like all

00:22:22.12 right here's the bit and cool here goes this ain't the hardy

00:22:26.13 boys or a Nancy drew mystery it's just Keenan and kell in your vicinity like

00:22:31.18 siegfried and roy or costello magikang Kareem or pen an tell a and then I

00:22:37.07 realized I paused the movie and I looked at the to the tv it's it's freaking

00:22:42.23 Kareem Abdul-jabbar yeah he plays roger Murdock the guy in the

00:22:47.05 cockpit and I was like I was like why is everything in my life

00:22:51.11 right now in the kingdom kill song I I was I'll be honest I was half expecting

00:22:56.19 and gillette to fall through my ceiling I was like what is going on

00:23:01.03 we were both like jaw open like what is happening right now I'm in a simulation

00:23:06.23 is there a line in the key to kill rap about how the shift key works because I

00:23:12.00 have not heard I have not heard the rap and that could have helped me there is

00:23:18.13 were you wearing socks at this point

00:23:22.10 anyway uh airplane still a funny movie airplane holds up really well I actually

00:23:28.08 took Millie my daughter to see it in the theater uh

00:23:31.14 I guess 2019 summer 2018 and it was well first off uh a 15 year old kid has no

00:23:36.22 frame of reference for 98 of those jokes but still very funny

00:23:41.01 and the thing that you forget about that movie uh and their style of humor is

00:23:45.21 that there's a joke every five seconds yeah it's like those zucker brothers

00:23:51.09 movies like they've done all the I guess naked gun and like I think

00:23:54.23 they're involved in basketball and stuff

00:23:57.11 there's just like a visual gag or a joke every

00:24:00.00 six seconds they've got like a jpm uh minimum of like 30 jokes a minute or

00:24:04.21 something it's ridiculous also I realized from I found out afterwards

00:24:09.16 that all those people in that movie like Lloyd bridges and uh

00:24:13.07 Phelps whatever his name is and Leslie Nielsen they'd never had comedic roles

00:24:18.09 before that movie they were all like like really serious

00:24:22.04 actors and it like reinvigorated all of their careers as as comedy dudes yeah

00:24:26.08 and Nielsen ended up having his second act was way bigger than his first

00:24:30.03 because of all that I view him as a comedy actor and I viewed creep shows

00:24:34.10 like oh that's a weird exception to the rule where he plays like kind of a

00:24:38.00 sinister murdering character then not realizing that that's what his career

00:24:43.03 was for a time dude creep show's a great movie meeting

00:24:46.03 [ __ ] I used to say that to myself all the time meteor [ __ ]

00:24:50.10 [Music]

00:24:52.02 I didn't realize that airplane was a parody of airport until I watched

00:24:55.09 airport I had no idea that those I just thought airplane was a funny movie that

00:24:58.23 was not spoofing anything else I thought it was a bizarre comedy it was strange

00:25:03.07 to watch airport be like oh this is airplane so what was zero hour is that

00:25:07.07 because they made multiple airports is there an airport called zero hour

00:25:11.13 everyone was like a trilogy airport is like a weirdly big movie I've

00:25:15.14 never seen it zero hour was the other movie right I thought that was what

00:25:18.23 airplane was the that's the one that had like all the combat stuff was based on

00:25:23.05 right but the the main guy in zero hour is ted striker who's also the main guy

00:25:27.08 in an airplane right like that part the striker stuff is based off zero hour but

00:25:30.15 the I think a lot of the other stuff is based off airport it's like a

00:25:33.12 combination

00:25:35.11 what percentage of the face what year what year did that hold on

00:25:39.14 what year did airplane come out it's like 1980.

00:25:43.09 We're talking about a movie yeah on my side we're talking about a

00:25:47.15 movie that was came out years and years and years before y'all were born I was

00:25:51.20 five and I'm a thousand like we probably should move on to something this you

00:25:56.17 don't think the people listening have listened to

00:26:01.01 the 1970s airport I don't think they've seen dean martin as a pilot before

00:26:05.08 I think maybe not but I think they should they should well they should

00:26:09.22 watch airplane airport not really needed to watch it's okay it's very fine.

00:29:05.03 face that's b e t t e r h e I p dot com slash face

00:29:09.12 god I was uh I was looking at my notes uh of stuff that I have to talk about

00:29:13.01 today I don't have a lot and so I was going to lean on Gavin uh I do have one

00:29:17.01 funny one funny one very quick small story uh and then we could talk about

00:29:21.05 how I'm going to Vegas this weekend for you Andrew and so we should discuss that

00:29:25.15 maybe okay uh but also Andrew and I don't know if we want to get into it uh

00:29:29.12 we still have superhero but then under it and while Gavin was talking I was

00:29:33.21 talking about airport I was reading and I just it just hit me

00:29:37.06 I had no idea what this note meant but I

00:29:40.08 wrote down just the word crabbing and it

00:29:43.05 took me most of this podcast to remember why I wrote that down yeah can I guess

00:29:48.04 please uh you were that you were trying to think of other words for

00:29:52.22 theft like scrumping and you discovered that crabs when you steal a crab is

00:29:57.12 crabby no we were Andrew and I were having

00:30:00.20 I wouldn't say a disagreement we were having a conversation about uh

00:30:06.00 I guess like a strategy like a surrounding podcast

00:30:10.15 like a behind-the-scenes work kind of strategy and we were kind of talking

00:30:15.00 through it and he made an analogy about uh how when you go crabbing you leave

00:30:19.23 your crab traps you don't put all your crab traps in the same spot you set them

00:30:23.21 out uh in a around so you have a wider you can't you're essentially casting a

00:30:27.13 wider net a wider crab net as it were and I got it in my head that I thought

00:30:31.17 it would be really funny if we all went crabbing together because I've never

00:30:35.23 been crabbing I don't even like crabs I guarantee you've never been crabbing

00:30:40.01 Andrew and I both decided there's no way gavin's ever been crabbing and he's

00:30:43.10 never been crabbing I don't even know what it entails or what I would do with

00:30:47.00 crabs if I caught him but the idea of going crabbing with my two best friends

00:30:51.02 an activity that none of us have done before I'm assuming sounds really fun to

00:30:55.16 me so I think we should all go crabbing in Vancouver island someday I think an

00:31:00.19 important note too for our text is I made the crab

00:31:03.14 netting analogy and then Geoff asked have I gone crabbing before and I replied no

00:31:08.16 and I have no idea how it works that was

00:31:10.13 a wild analogy for me to make I actually don't know anything that I'm saying

00:31:14.14 regarding this topic I agree we should do this at some point there should just

00:31:18.20 be a list of things we haven't done that we're not enthusiastic about doing and

00:31:23.01 then we have to do them or we have to assign those tasks to one of us we need

00:31:27.00 to order because there's a lot we have to get done at the moment we set foot on

00:31:30.15 Vancouver island like we gotta get straight to work there's not enough time

00:31:34.12 to do everything you can watch the bathtub races while crabbing from the dock

00:31:38.23 it's gotta be there though because we don't have crabs in Austin it's not crab

00:31:42.19 country you know I will say we've already got the perfect receptacle for

00:31:47.03 crabs yeah what is it you made it you made it

00:31:51.03 Andrew oh the basket yeah you can bring the basket back

00:31:55.05 no that's true yeah could you imagine the expression on everybody's faces if

00:32:01.09 they saw us lower that into the water why are you

00:32:04.03 dunking that tumbleweed into the water

00:32:06.23 if you think about it though if there was a venn diagram of like

00:32:11.09 Andrew you're 26 now 27262727 now and

00:32:15.03 Gavin you're 32333333 now I'm I'm I'm trying to give you guys each a year I'm

00:32:20.13 sorry you just you're getting up there and it's it's gross so I'm trying to

00:32:25.09 help you out I'm 46. That's the combined amount of time is I don't know the math

00:32:30.02 on that but probably close to 100 or around 100 years of combined activities

00:32:35.10 so the venn diagram of of things that haven't been done by all three of us has

00:32:41.12 got to be pretty small I don't think that's true at all no I

00:32:44.15 think it's very wise I I think you'd be surprised at how many things you've done

00:32:48.04 that you don't realize that what you throw out an activity you're like oh no

00:32:53.16 I did do that once have you ever uh skinned a rabbit

00:32:58.21 no but I've seen it done in person it's gross

00:33:03.01 seen in video games does that count for anything I watched roger and me

00:33:08.00 Arthur Morgan yeah exactly no I don't think I mean it's also wild

00:33:12.13 you need to factor in when you're evaluating this experience chart that

00:33:16.23 you've made Geoff I haven't just tried scrambled eggs or a glass of milk like

00:33:22.00 my contribution to the range of experience is narrow

00:33:25.21 it's more like two and a quarter person I understand that I understand that but

00:33:29.23 you knew who James randy was and I had no [ __ ] clue so there are you have

00:33:34.21 you are a keeper of knowledge and experience whether you

00:33:38.12 realize yeah no I thought honestly when you did that I thought you knew and you

00:33:42.15 were testing me to see if I did I didn't know what happened

00:33:45.16 to you not knowing no I assumed he was uh I assumed you wouldn't know he who he

00:33:49.07 was and he was like some British personality that we don't know here in

00:33:53.01 america I didn't I didn't I didn't account for the fact that he uh he was

00:33:57.09 Canadian I did he did work a lot in the uk though it's watched a bunch of

00:34:01.01 English [ __ ] he was in I I would say the

00:34:03.06 if you took if you took every activity on earth and then you know our venn

00:34:07.18 diagram of all the stuff that we've all done I would say 99 of things have been

00:34:12.21 done by none of us yes well then we better get to work that's what I'm saying

00:34:18.12 we got a lot of [ __ ] to do I say we start with crabbin and then we just find

00:34:23.11 out what else naturally we don't have to go looking for it but we find out what

00:34:26.23 else fits and like fits in the center of that diagram that's never been touched

00:34:30.16 by the three of us it's like a set and leave sort of thing though right yeah

00:34:34.07 but you put like on boots and then you clomp around in the mud and the water

00:34:38.01 and then I'm I'm assuming somebody will fall down and that'll be funny and

00:34:42.10 you'll be dirty I think from what I feel like I've

00:34:45.09 observed of crabbing you can just walk to the end of like a pier and drop a

00:34:50.12 basket in and then just pull it up you think it's that fast

00:34:54.05 well I yeah I don't think well I think it depends and you just wait for a bite

00:34:57.17 you just wait for the line to move I think you wait like 20 minutes would be

00:35:01.04 my guess and then you pull the basket up

00:35:02.00 and if there are crabs you're like sweet you put them in the bucket and if

00:35:05.11 they're not you just throw the thing back into the water obviously I thought

00:35:08.23 you just went up to a crab pool and just picked up a crab I thought why didn't

00:35:12.04 what you needed what do you mean no what

00:35:14.01 you got those little shallows where the rocks light with the the you're kind of

00:35:17.09 [ __ ]

00:35:18.13 Crabbing with your hands they got they got blades on their arms

00:35:22.17 it's the most from the back that's a risky game if you're going into

00:35:27.00 a pool they're coming from all angles what are you talking about that could be

00:35:30.08 attack in your leg yeah it's going to be like Jurassic whatever

00:35:33.21 chili's tendon is dude they're going to take you down

00:35:37.00 yeah you're at your most vulnerable right there

00:35:39.18 kevin's going to be like this is no problem he's going to be like peter

00:35:42.18 storm Aaron [ __ ] Jurassic too and there's gonna be a million crabs on him

00:35:46.19 he's gonna get [ __ ] devoured all of a sudden I've talked over a

00:35:50.07 longer than just a lot of blood floats back

00:35:53.20 look I I think if we all go crabbing I bet I can pick up a crab with my bare

00:35:59.06 hands faster than you can faff about with your boots and your little there's if

00:36:05.03 all kinds of crabbing activities that we can do

00:36:08.01 crap we'll have all kinds of like crabbing crabbing competitions I

00:36:11.12 remember Andrew I thought you said you were gonna mosey on down to the pier one

00:36:14.17 day and sit and watch for a while and take notes or did I make that up yeah

00:36:18.06 maybe I don't know I don't remember if I said that via text but if crabbing was

00:36:22.00 what Gavin described if I knew nothing about it and I believe Gavin I would

00:36:25.23 show up with like pillows duct tape to my body and tongs of both hands like I'd

00:36:30.12 be I would not be prepared to just walk in and grab that's just gloves I think I

00:36:36.02 think it's just what they don't get like jumpers no I need range I need tongs I

00:36:40.07 need tongs in both hands I don't trust I don't trust this all right how big are

00:36:44.13 the crabs in your imagination right now because mine are just like like the size

00:36:48.00 of a fist or something yeah yeah they're around that size too I still just don't

00:36:51.17 want to deal with that I don't want it I don't I listen I cut my foot the other

00:36:56.10 day I'm scared I'm scared of sharp objects is was that when you went

00:36:59.17 outside to get your birthday presents no it wasn't it was inside I did how did

00:37:03.22 you do it I was going to bed it was really late it was dark and I stepped on

00:37:07.23 there was just a piece of glass on my floor I guess that I didn't know was

00:37:12.05 glass as moving stuff and I stepped on it I was like I stepped on something

00:37:16.00 that's that's annoying so I went to brush it off by rubbing it across the

00:37:21.11 bot at the top of my other foot and I just sliced across the top of it

00:37:25.11 and I was like that didn't feel good so then I just went to bed and was like oh

00:37:28.17 man my foot's sore I think I may have cut it or something I don't know and I

00:37:32.02 woke up and I had blood in my sheets and like this this cut across the top of my

00:37:36.04 foot so I'm very nervous of sharp things right now Gavin I do not want to [ __ ]

00:37:41.07 with these crabs I don't trust them don't run a crab across your skin

00:37:46.00 no they won't so I'll be covered in pillows with my tongs

00:37:49.12 also we can bring those little rubber bands that you get on like asparagus and

00:37:53.04 celery and stuff and then we can snap them on their uh around their little

00:37:56.15 pinchers I like that idea can we get rubber band guns and try to shoot it

00:38:01.14 onto them and what we should also do and where I'm

00:38:05.16 going with that is once we've got them subdued to the point where they're not a

00:38:10.23 danger to us or each other then I think we determine who our our favorite crab

00:38:16.13 each is and then we do a crab race okay

00:38:18.11 like make a little track and then we put him at one end and then we get to the

00:38:21.12 other end and we try to encourage our crab like come on crabby come on old

00:38:25.04 blue you know come on pinchy or whatever and then we see who who's the best crab

00:38:28.15 racer in addition uh to crabbing in general there's so

00:38:32.15 much crab crab related stuff we can do are we releasing them afterwards are we

00:38:36.02 gonna have no I I don't think I could kill a crab I think we'd have to you

00:38:40.10 could kill you can't kill a crab you could he could

00:38:43.07 smash its claw shot and make it race well and I did that wasn't my idea I

00:38:47.03 didn't put that for hey that's calisthenics dude well I'm sorry we're

00:38:50.11 not hurting the crab by making it work out and we're gonna fix we're gonna take

00:38:54.11 the rubber bands off at the end okay not gonna release a neutered crab back into

00:38:58.23 the wild and not be able to defend itself

00:39:01.21 and we could release them back into the wild free and like put up maybe we'll

00:39:05.11 you know one of them will have a tiny trophy it can take with it but yeah ah

00:39:09.16 the awesome trophy.

00:39:12.19 I'd be terrible I don't think we should glue things to crabs

00:39:18.13 I don't think we should do anything to craft I agree anywhere near this pool

00:39:25.03 what do you mean do you think on this grand scheme of

00:39:28.23 things eating them is better than putting something on them like at least

00:39:33.03 in my scenario I would say catching and quickly dispatching a crab for food is

00:39:38.00 less humiliating and harmful than gluing a crown to its head

00:39:43.20 and binding his claws no that's never never do that never bind

00:39:48.23 the claws I don't want to glue anything but it's just it's funny you're you're

00:39:52.12 just like no I want to do the more humane thing of killing it needing it

00:39:55.23 that's what I would like to do well I mean it happened

00:40:00.13 every day chances are chances are that crab's

00:40:03.14 killed a few things in its life every 10

00:40:06.22 seconds a crab is killed.

00:40:09.01 I don't even know how you kill a crowd I think you just stab it from my

00:40:14.08 understanding they're pretty hard that's like a lobster right do you do the same

00:40:18.02 thing with the crab [ __ ] look at Gavin is over here talking about crabs

00:40:21.16 being invulnerable with claws and he's like I'm hopping in the pool what are

00:40:24.18 you saying what are you talking about do you think you could break a crab's nose

00:40:28.12 the crab pool and your analogy you're like I'm gonna hop into the crab pool

00:40:32.02 and just grab crabs in my hands and on the other side of it I'm like how do you

00:40:35.05 kill them and you're like they're [ __ ] invulnerable and they have claws

00:40:40.13 like what are you doing that's reckless I don't understand

00:40:45.11 I don't understand your logic at all the crazy thing about this is these are

00:40:51.01 all of our pre-crabbing opinions of how it's gonna go

00:40:55.04 someday we're gonna have a post-crabbing episode and we'll find out how wrong we

00:41:01.07 were about all of it we couldn't be more

00:41:03.07 wrong I feel like the real version would be very boring of us standing on a pier

00:41:08.23 I I don't think that anything we do will be boring but I can't wait for our our

00:41:14.23 post crab and wrap up think of all the crab related knowledge

00:41:17.21 that we'll have in our brains after this and then we can move on to the next

00:41:21.23 thing and before you know it we will have done that 99 of all stuff in the

00:41:25.08 universe I don't know if I've ever even had crab legs like I know I've had crab

00:41:29.13 and like sushi but I don't think I've ever had crab legs or

00:41:33.18 a dish like that like a crab-based thing

00:41:36.23 that wasn't sushi would you rather if we were to have a crab lunch of crab legs

00:41:40.13 not the crabs that we're gonna be catching obviously would you rather have

00:41:44.08 that lunch before we go crabbing or after we go crabbing what do you think

00:41:48.06 would be psychologically better for you yeah I think psychologically probably

00:41:53.11 before to be like I think so too we we owned you guys we got that yeah

00:41:57.03 we have the advantage we're clearly in the power position

00:42:00.21 psych yourself up it'll make us feel like you're dead on we'll be in the

00:42:05.05 power position it'll make us feel superior I really I would be afraid that

00:42:09.00 like if my crab imprints on me or I put an imprint on it and we develop a

00:42:12.22 connection there's been no way I could follow through with eating a different

00:42:16.00 crab later in the same day what if they could tell and they were more pissed

00:42:21.12 that is also true I don't know I didn't think about that yeah I don't know

00:42:26.15 that changes everything I didn't consider that as an angle well one way

00:42:31.01 to find out I guess so maybe yeah I don't know maybe one of us eats crabs

00:42:34.12 beforehand and the rest don't and we just discuss how we feel about it I

00:42:37.22 don't know I don't know how we measure that I don't really like crab not not a

00:42:41.08 fan of it yeah same I think I've only eaten it once in my life I don't

00:42:44.13 remember anything about it but I feel like I've only had it on the top of a

00:42:48.14 slightly fancy steak at a restaurant once which and it didn't really it

00:42:52.04 didn't really make the steak any better to me

00:42:55.18 you mentioned you're going to Vegas Geoff I had an immunization I'm gonna go buy

00:43:01.12 video games for you this weekend uh well you can talk about that I was

00:43:05.06 actually as nervous because I texted you about that as I I texted you last night

00:43:09.08 about it and you didn't reply at all and I got very as nervous I'll be honest

00:43:13.12 with you it's a it was a whole long text

00:43:15.16 about like second guessing and stuff and I already bought the tickets I've

00:43:18.20 already booked the hotel yeah we have a driver like it's to we're too far along

00:43:24.08 to pull the plug now in the in a Vegas kind of aspect is you're

00:43:28.19 gonna also you want to put your rookie bets down while you're there I'm gonna

00:43:32.15 put all of our rookie bets down well I'll bet for Gavin yeah I have

00:43:36.08 cracked my gambling code I figured out how to win I've come up with a system

00:43:41.11 and last night I I finally figured it out

00:43:44.11 I bet let me get organize these photos so I bet on the

00:43:48.02 royals game the Kansas Kansas royals Kansas city royals and the Baltimore

00:43:52.23 orioles and it was the s they were going into the seventh inning I want to say

00:43:58.20 and I bet that there would be less than 6.5 runs I believe was the bet total

00:44:04.06 total yeah okay and what was the score what was the score in the seventh inning

00:44:09.04 at that point when you placed the bet zero zero so let's yes so this is this

00:44:13.09 is the score right now or this is the score going into the seventh Kansas had

00:44:17.01 four four runs okay it's the they're going into the seventh inning I bet that

00:44:21.13 there wouldn't be more than six if they got seven I would lose the bet

00:44:25.15 I'm feeling confident about it I'm like ah they have a lead it'll be kind of a

00:44:29.12 slow game everything will be fine then we move into the seventh inning

00:44:34.11 and the Kansas city royal score one more run here's what I'm noticing about the

00:44:39.02 Kansas city royals they score every other uh they score every odd inning and

00:44:44.09 there's nine innings so you have a ninth inning coming up

00:44:48.17 yeah so every every second inning so my bet is less than than than seven

00:44:53.00 yeah is that what says 6.5 can you get 0.5 no you can't get point five it's

00:44:57.12 just to the to set the line so if I get six I win if it goes to seven I lose is

00:45:03.03 essentially being under seven would also work yes under seven

00:45:07.12 would be fine so just six which is six I don't that was a weird

00:45:10.09 way of phrasing that less than seven but no well no well yeah okay well I'm

00:45:14.11 saying what it doesn't matter it doesn't matter like why is it six and a half if

00:45:18.12 there's only six and seven because it can't be it can't be six and

00:45:23.12 a half so if it crosses to seven if it is seven then I would win with seven

00:45:27.12 yeah if it's seven no one wins yeah it's just setting a line that it could

00:45:31.05 be above or below there has to be a 0.5

00:45:33.16 so they're going into the eighth inning and Kansas now has five runs total

00:45:39.07 I'm getting nervous so then they do nothing Kansas gets

00:45:43.07 nothing can you say Kansas city please Kansas city okay thank you what what was

00:45:49.01 that Kansas you just keep saying Kansas it just drives me crazy it's Kansas city

00:45:53.05 would it be better if I said royals uh that's fine too

00:45:57.11 Kansas Kansas and Kansas city are different places okay

00:46:01.00 royals the royals needed one more run I was nervous

00:46:04.13 and then I stopped watching I looked again the orioles had bases loaded no outs

00:46:10.01 and I was like oh [ __ I this is gonna as soon as I bet the under

00:46:14.16 everything shifted the game shifted so then I panicked that and I took the

00:46:19.18 orioles to just win I just reversed my bet which would then

00:46:23.22 then mean that for that to happen I would need to lose my other bed but I am

00:46:27.19 such a jinx whenever I bet on anything I lose immediately I bet on the red sox

00:46:32.08 losing 10 seconds later they home run and win the game buy two it's just a

00:46:36.17 ridiculous curse I realize the success to me

00:46:39.17 winning bets is I need to start fading myself I will make one bet saying an

00:46:44.07 obvious thing will happen and then I will bet on the unlikely thing and hope

00:46:48.22 that happens so then we're in the eighth inning and in the eighth inning

00:46:54.06 this is what happens as soon as I counter my mind the royal score

00:47:00.12 nine runs in the eighth inning what do you mean the orioles dude yeah

00:47:04.23 nine runs so I bet that it would be under 6.5

00:47:10.13 then they scored nine I panicked once it

00:47:14.06 was at six or whatever I bet the orioles to win to counter myself I'm fading

00:47:19.16 myself because once I bet one way then it will absolutely go the opposite

00:47:25.05 of whatever I said so the trick is fading myself I bet one way bet the

00:47:29.03 other way orioles scored nine runs and it was even a cartoonish thing my bad

00:47:33.11 luck is so bad the runs came in because the royals tripped each other in the

00:47:39.09 outfield that was gonna be an easy catch in the back to to end the inning and

00:47:42.22 instead he tripped the guy he spread it over and took him out at the knees which

00:47:47.19 allowed nine runs to happen so was there a grand slam involved there

00:47:52.11 was uh there were no grand slams but it was like three runs scored in because he

00:47:56.12 tripped his own guy and then so the inning ended they scored nine runs they

00:48:01.01 have a nine to what five lead at that point I'm like this is great

00:48:05.12 we're going into the ninth inning only one inning left this is what the final

00:48:10.19 score ended up being for the game so it ended up being

00:48:14.19 nine to eight for the orioles I was sweating when the royals were

00:48:18.09 coming back they scored three runs I was like this is unfucking believable I

00:48:23.16 realized that my bad luck is like a pendulum so I need to fade myself late

00:48:27.12 but not too late because it goes back and forth like once it realizes that

00:48:31.19 I've made a counter bet and then has to

00:48:34.01 run back to [ __ ] me over that way so the key to my betting in the future is

00:48:38.12 fading against myself but late in the game so there isn't enough time for it

00:48:42.12 to bite me in the ass going or or fade early enough that you can refade at the

00:48:47.12 at the left I can't triple fade there's no triple fade there's no triple fade

00:48:51.08 that's just losing that'd be that'd be terrible I mean if you I think you could

00:48:55.12 because if you could place could you place in two bets versus one at that

00:48:59.07 point and two outweighs one so you just it's just a matter of

00:49:01.22 how much that's just a bet again yeah yeah that's true I was texting Eric when

00:49:07.09 it happened and what it was eight to nine with them still at bat I was like

00:49:10.23 did I double fade myself holy [ __ ]

00:49:13.09 I have terrible luck but yeah that's the

00:49:15.01 key I'm just going to bet against myself going forward I've always said if

00:49:18.03 somebody faded me they'd do great I'm going to be that person I'm just going

00:49:21.14 to start bending against do you worry that you're affecting these games I

00:49:24.19 think the players will be pissed if they're listening

00:49:27.09 you think they're going to be pissed wait till the magic starts happening dude

00:49:33.11 yeah this is pre voodoo

00:49:36.08 that was my night that was ridiculous I've never seen nine runs scored in an

00:49:41.11 inning before especially that late went down five to zero

00:49:44.08 it's a great game man the crowd must have been going ape [ __ ] nine in an

00:49:48.17 inning I feel like nobody was in the crowd I feel like a lot of people left

00:49:53.02 doesn't seem like a one-sided game oh yeah but well yeah they did nothing

00:49:57.19 for seven years yeah just to see like it was

00:50:01.06 locked up and then they just scored nine in one inning but it was more the the

00:50:05.12 adventure of fading against myself is gonna be a fun journey going forward do

00:50:08.23 you think some sort of pep talk happened after the seventh inning like what

00:50:12.17 happened there it showed an image of don zimmer on the back rallied everybody

00:50:17.19 is it uh is it clash of the titans or Jason and

00:50:20.21 the argonauts that has like the gods like kind of puppeteering what's

00:50:25.05 happening to the to the mortals below do you think that's what the people in the

00:50:28.23 stand what was happening to the people in the stands of that game they had no

00:50:32.12 idea that Andrew the the betting baseball god was affecting the outcome

00:50:37.01 of their game and they were just they were just along for the ride it has

00:50:41.20 happened I showed Eric a different bet before

00:50:43.22 that involved the padres and I was like how do you feel about this he's like oh

00:50:47.01 that's an easy bet you should do that and I did it and then they they died

00:50:51.05 they had a terrible game I tanked them I feel like I can tank teams I feel like

00:50:55.12 I'm like a long distance cooler you're making me a little nervous about this uh

00:50:59.20 this roulette idea we had for this weekend I got to be honest with you

00:51:04.21 was it a roulette idea or a kino idea what is what is that

00:51:08.04 what an interesting you're getting your pics in from a different country

00:51:12.10 yeah that's great I didn't realize you want to do roulette it was that's more

00:51:15.18 of a live game than I was Emily had this idea Gavin that while we're in Vegas

00:51:19.21 this weekend we should go to a roulette wheel and we should have Andrew run his

00:51:24.12 ball machine and pop a number out and then we bet on that number ah

00:51:29.07 I feel like you kind of used up all your luck last week well no

00:51:34.08 never know might be worth trying again amazing if that hit I love that nobody

00:51:38.07 really commented on that in that episode that came out and I think it's because

00:51:42.02 people are scared that it was fake like they don't want to celebrate it out of

00:51:45.17 the fear that they'll be proved wrong I think it's because more people would

00:51:48.22 just heard the shifting and thought it was insane they were so distracted by

00:51:52.12 the goddamn shift thing they never heard that part of the podcast probably

00:51:56.04 it's just weird there's a weird thing that happened I hope it works for you

00:51:59.22 I'm terrible with roulette though as established so I you need to balance

00:52:04.10 that out against the machine yeah yeah no I'm I'm I'm not anticipating winning

00:52:08.07 but we'll see so what's this Vegas trip uh oh Andrew wants me to buy some video

00:52:14.12 games for him that's not true necessarily I wouldn't [Laughter]

00:52:18.19 that's that's you said technically what's happening I found this place that's

00:52:23.22 selling these video games I want it's in

00:52:23.22 Vegas and I said I'll go to Vegas do you want to go well and you were like I

00:52:29.03 can't I can't go to Vegas right now because I'm in Canada and it's a whole

00:52:30.19 thing and I said well I'll go for you I'll go buy your video games that's a

00:52:34.11 different thing that is a complete you're right I'm joking but I am going I

00:52:38.23 was looking for an excuse to go and this is an excuse but I really do want to go

00:52:43.09 to Vegas yeah I just I just needed one reason to go you were my reason that's

00:52:47.17 that was just an important clarification because I'd feel terrible if I was and

00:52:52.01 that was the sole motivator of going I don't know I just don't like the idea of

00:52:55.08 persuading you to do that for that reason I'm collecting some games right

00:52:59.07 now I decided I wanted to try to get some games that I really enjoyed growing

00:53:04.23 up mainly on the 360360 because there's not much collecting happening as far as

00:53:08.12 like sealed 360 games go at this point and they have a bunch of and you told me

00:53:14.12 something that blew my mind and might surprise you as well Gavin uh the

00:53:19.12 Xbox 360 is going to be a classic console win

00:53:22.12 I think 2025 right it's one something turns 20. So like four years from now

00:53:27.12 yeah it'll be retro the 360 will be in the retro category which is very weird

00:53:32.15 to think about so your your cat is retro my cat is retro I'm a retro cat

00:53:41.12 but then Andrew he started texting me all the stuff last night he was like

00:53:45.04 listen I'm starting to read about this place it seems kind of sketchy I don't

00:53:49.14 want to send you into a bad environment and then like am I going to buy Xbox 360

00:53:55.01 games or am I buying meth well no I just so I saw a video and somebody was like

00:53:59.09 oh I went game hunting in Vegas this is what I found I was like oh that's funny

00:54:02.21 because of what we talked about and I watched it and they went to the place

00:54:06.21 and they had a really bad experience and my anxiety with I want you and Emily to

00:54:11.09 have a fantastic trip that's way more important to me than those games so I

00:54:16.23 just didn't want you to be in any form of uncomfortable or unpleasant

00:54:21.04 experience because of me on your trip that was purely an anxiety play of I

00:54:25.07 just want you and Emily to have a fantastic time I was playing I I'm gonna

00:54:29.10 have a fantastic time I appreciate it I've already booked some stuff I was

00:54:32.22 just gonna go sometime Saturday in the afternoon take a cab over there with the

00:54:37.00 list buy what you need and throw it in my hotel room and go back to go back

00:54:40.12 about my my sports book uh betting business

00:54:43.09 uh which I'll probably spend most of the weekend in the sports book honestly so

00:54:47.12 uh it'll be an hour and a half inconvenience and if it goes wrong it's

00:54:52.11 content and if it goes right it's less content but still coming so

00:54:56.13 I'm cool with it either way it's a great week to go to Vegas nfl season starts

00:55:00.18 yeah I made an absurd under bet which there's no way it will hit but it's fun

00:55:05.16 I took every game going under and I think it's ten dollars and it cashes out

00:55:09.15 at like a hundred and sixty thousand dollars if it wins

00:55:13.13 what are you gonna do with all that money yeah buys a lot of 360 games it

00:55:18.02 does nothing there's no way it hits I do like about the under though I stirred

00:55:22.04 every game a winner I start every game in a winning position

00:55:27.11 that's true it is true I gotta go rescue

00:55:30.06 uh puss puss for Henry who's gonna growl just a second wait what is it

00:55:35.14 that's owl have we heard of post post on the show

00:55:38.19 before I'm not sure I've had a puss puss yet I don't is that a new toy that in

00:55:44.10 the rotation all right crisis averted wait is

00:55:47.08 post post a new toy Geoff puss plus is the octopus it's been there before we've

00:55:50.12 talked about it oh okay yeah I'm familiar with the octopus that is not

00:55:53.12 neutral now plus plus isn't new that's interesting I like the naming scheme of

00:55:57.02 the toys I don't name them they're just the names that are given to me by Emily

00:56:03.01 she's the she's the clever namer what are the other toys named oh

00:56:07.11 everything twice uh there's everything there's owl owl there's uh

00:56:12.12 I don't know a bone bone dog dog I made that [ __ ] up but it's like

00:56:16.11 whatever whatever you see just say it twice and that's what it is but there's

00:56:19.11 a different rule for post posts because it's an octopus so it's only the back

00:56:23.03 half it's not octopus octopus yeah and we say we typically call it ow owl

00:56:27.12 instead of owl owl because it sounds like it's getting hurt when he squeezes

00:56:30.22 it so okay so it's like a one syllable if the name goes beyond two you're only

00:56:36.08 using the back syllable I'm sure there's others I don't think so gavin's vinvin

00:56:41.09 in this name scam

00:56:44.00 Gavin is uh Gavin is gavrer uh and will forever be gavir

00:56:49.18 because that's what my daughter called him when she was like two or three

00:56:54.22 to my for the rest of my life he'll be gabber in my head I'd rather be gabber

00:56:58.19 than vinvin vivin is not a good nickname oh my god
