00:00:00.03 [Music]

00:00:07.23 [Music]

00:00:15.09 Hello and welcome to another episode of the F**kFuckFacePodcast my name is Geoff Ramsey

00:00:21.16 with me as always Andrew panton and Gavin free hello okay

00:00:25.22 it's you I mean you okay Gavin just said hello what's wrong with that I think it

00:00:31.09 was a discord thing it like cut out it just oh

00:00:34.03 yeah I heard you just made a noise cut out and you just went

00:00:39.12 oh I just tried to give a oh hello it was a pretty disjointed hello on our end.

00:00:45.03 [Laughter]

00:00:47.16 Uh Andrew hello how are you doing buddy uh

00:00:54.04 not the best but we're we're making it we're okay why why not the best

00:00:58.21 okay well this I guess we're going right in right into things I mean with 100

00:01:04.05 ankle integrity and you're not yeah 100

00:01:07.02 yes uh I've covered right now so that that is complicated

00:01:11.17 yeah so I've coveted we just did a whole episode of you having come and you

00:01:15.18 didn't even tell us well it ties to the grocery aisle thing and

00:01:20.19 that never really came up says I waited it came up well I came up in a

00:01:24.20 way that I didn't want to get into because it's a long we're going into

00:01:28.21 maybe a long story conveniently it came up with the last 10

00:01:32.07 minutes and we need to do two episodes it didn't make sense for me to unspool

00:01:37.03 yeah the last episode playing zayn or vozloo he did

00:01:41.20 which is a great game did you get coveted in cap no

00:01:46.17 no I did not I have not I I that did not begin so

00:01:50.11 I I'm in a position to do this I haven't done it obviously because I've covets

00:01:55.11 that complicate I can't just go to the store I've been quarantining um

00:01:59.08 but I was talking because I'm sick I'm like talking to my mom all the time

00:02:02.13 she's calling me constantly and I I talked to her about

00:02:05.12 the the end cap thing and I was like yeah I can't do the end cap thing and

00:02:09.22 she was all about it she is all into this end cap idea she

00:02:13.22 thought it was so funny she was like well I'll do this I can get stuff from

00:02:17.12 the end cap for you and I'll just drop these groceries off and I was like you

00:02:21.07 don't need to do that it's fine it's some sick and we could just do this

00:02:24.08 another time so no no you want to do this you talked about you're going to

00:02:28.02 bring this up on the show we can do this this is no problem I will go to the

00:02:33.14 grocery store I will take photos of the end caps and then you can let me know

00:02:39.03 what you want on the end caps and I said this

00:02:42.13 your mother is awesome she's the antsy salad cream yeah no but no but my mom

00:02:46.18 for context doesn't she is she's got an iPhone 6 which is like probably 10 years

00:02:51.13 old at this point it's very old phone she doesn't know how to use it she

00:02:55.12 constantly puts it on silent silent mode and doesn't know how to reverse it she

00:03:00.00 is not tech uh based in any way she's completely

00:03:03.09 inept when it comes to tech so it's incredibly sweet that she wants to do

00:03:08.06 this but I just see a million ways in which this is going to be complicated

00:03:11.17 and not go the way that it was intended to I said it's very kind you don't need

00:03:15.10 to do that it's very sweet of you if you

00:03:17.16 want to you can and she's like I'm going to do it so it's like okay so I've been

00:03:21.07 waiting waited earlier in the day she texted me I'm at the grocery store

00:03:26.04 then there was like a 30 or 40 minute break for a day

00:03:29.20 or anything and I thought what is what is going on

00:03:34.06 she then she calls me and she said Andrew I took all the photos

00:03:39.06 I'm trying to text you I took 67 photos oh no I'm trying I'm trying to send them

00:03:44.10 to you all at once and it will not go through what do you want to do about

00:03:48.04 this do you want me to just tell you what's in all the end caps one by one

00:03:53.16 and then we could add it I'm like no just fine just just uh

00:03:56.12 relax like maybe sit in your car and you can just send me some of the photos and

00:04:00.01 chunks if you want to or we could just scrap this idea entirely we do this

00:04:04.15 later she's like no it's fine I'll send them in caps

00:04:08.00 so I got I was getting them in like blocks of 10 but it was 67 photos and uh

00:04:13.12 I'm not in no way going to make fun or attack my mom but it was Geoff level

00:04:18.15 quality some of these some of these pictures the decisions

00:04:23.00 some of the choices I'll post yeah do you have any two of them I can't

00:04:27.00 wait I'll take that as a compliment by the way let me show oh I was doing it I

00:04:31.01 mean he made don zimmer wink so it's like this this is one of the sides of

00:04:36.12 the end caps it's just the left side of it and it's just it's just tostitos

00:04:42.08 it's a salsa corner it's like I'm not gonna want salsa

00:04:46.19 I don't I'm not a typically a salsa guy and on top of the fact of I don't know

00:04:51.17 why you're just taking a photo of just that scene well she clearly is thinking

00:04:56.02 about resolution you know she thinks maybe you won't be able to see the

00:04:59.09 prices or the names if she's further away she's going in for details she is

00:05:03.22 she went she went all out so she took I think with 67 photos

00:05:07.14 we went through it all I picked I got very lucky I'm living if there wasn't

00:05:12.02 one the freezer you know how there's like a deli section and then at the end

00:05:17.14 of the deli like across from it there's an end cap this is uh

00:05:20.16 um I'm in the wrong section I'm gonna text there was a section a little

00:05:25.09 freezer section that had chicken in it bags of chicken oh I got bags of chicken

00:05:31.01 so I had that going for me that was a good one

00:05:34.04 no evidence whatsoever that's an end cap

00:05:37.13 I understand they're all close as I said she's zooming in on things [Music]

00:05:42.15 it's a serial end cap that's a pretty good one that's a lot I could work with

00:05:46.17 there that gives me some confidence I can make it what's vecta

00:05:51.06 a vector is a Canadian cereal that I loved as a child and I had recently

00:05:54.21 doesn't hold up I think they changed the

00:05:57.12 recipe it wasn't that's not come up in a big cereal conversation exactly I I was

00:06:01.14 lost in European cereal gavita when you're showing the honey monster

00:06:06.14 vector does not track it is not worth mentioning vector there's nothing funny

00:06:11.18 about it it's just athletic cereal these characters are so small by

00:06:15.06 the way Gavin you're you're peeking in in the top right of that photo of all

00:06:19.02 the cereal you are yeah the little creeper crunch in the top

00:06:23.05 right yeah is there a cereal called creeper crunch there sure is yeah wow

00:06:27.21 that sounds exciting that makes total sense there's a thrilling thrilling row

00:06:32.08 of uh that one's mainly

00:06:36.11 but also some annie's pasta in the bottom which I like

00:06:40.11 as well you got the best hand caps in the I think she's misunderstood end caps

00:06:45.18 no I went over this with her I was very clear I had this argument with her I

00:06:49.00 can't you got the best store in the world I think that's an end cap it looks

00:06:53.09 like an end of an aisle I agree nick but it's not it's nice like the end of

00:06:56.23 an aisle yeah that looks like she's she's delved in

00:07:00.11 I don't think that's true because we were very clear we went back and forth

00:07:04.16 on this and like do you understand and she's like yeah not in the aisle at all

00:07:09.03 just the things on on the on the night even

00:07:11.06 agrees with me even I agree too I looked at that and I said I don't think that

00:07:16.21 that's an end cap and uh we clarified and she she argued it was

00:07:19.22 I can't go to the store to confirm that that's true but I'll show you this is

00:07:23.12 what I got from my first first set up it's not a fun few days of food but it's

00:07:29.07 certainly livable uh I got some ramen got a few bags of ramen I got some

00:07:34.21 blueberry some blackberries uh they were in the section with the chicken I got

00:07:40.02 two chickens to roast uh tostitos lime rounds which I've never had but

00:07:46.19 tostito lime flavored chips are incredible it's a top-tier chip

00:07:51.05 and uh there is a little bit of a mix-up with the real fruit I did not want uh

00:07:56.16 real fruit gummies there was a shelf there was a shelf that was real fruit

00:08:02.15 snacks and uh she mistook that for a different shelf that featured real

00:08:09.09 fruit gummies I think I saved the photo of were they 12 bucks yeah

00:08:16.08 how much was this hole that's a great question I don't have the

00:08:20.10 answer to that I should look at the receipt so how are you going to prepare so

00:08:26.10 you basically got chicken and fruit

00:08:31.11 this is the there's a lot of candy aisles not including the 30 images of

00:08:36.22 candies and ships of just various aisles she grabbed the real fruit from the

00:08:42.08 candy section and not the end capped real fruit

00:08:45.13 snacks two different end caps of real this

00:08:49.03 is they're different end caps they are different products

00:08:55.01 they're two different brands I think I think one maybe they're not maybe

00:08:58.18 they're just different variations I don't know I haven't looked through I am

00:09:02.02 so [ __ ] excited to go to this grocery store and whenever we go to Canada and

00:09:08.00 see for myself well I'm excited I will confirm I'll make sure

00:09:12.13 I'll make sure but I'm pretty confident that everything is end cap valid

00:09:16.23 uh either way I just I just want to walk through these hallowed halls and see

00:09:21.18 where it all happened so yeah I don't I think maybe I'll do the ramen

00:09:26.20 without seasoning and have it like as a I don't know but I have two chickens to

00:09:31.22 work with and some fruit and and how long is this lasting you

00:09:35.15 um well the annie's can easily be a meal itself so those could be like two meals

00:09:41.16 the ramen's four uh this is probably like five days if I

00:09:45.05 really stretched four days and how are you how are you feeling you

00:09:49.01 are really glossing over the fact that you have coveted right now yeah I don't

00:09:53.14 feel great I'm tired it's been like both physically and

00:09:56.18 personal life not the best of times why didn't you tell us we could have easily

00:10:00.10 moved this recording no because I don't want to move it because I might I might

00:10:03.23 need to move stuff coming up so I just wanted I wanted to do this and it's fun

00:10:07.17 it's fun to spend time with you guys that's true I always have fun are you

00:10:12.10 recovering are you getting better yeah I'm good I'm all good I'm like it's

00:10:16.21 I'm fine I'm just exhausted.

00:10:25.03 I'm like on day three day four okay but a few days I have a question about your

00:10:30.10 end cap selection of course did you make choices to potentially

00:10:34.14 you know this is like one hall and then if you do another order from the end

00:10:37.15 caps you'll get different stuff or was this pretty much everything that you

00:10:40.18 wanted from the end caps this is yeah this is like uh ideally I'm gonna do

00:10:45.07 another another run of it at some other time that was so you've deliberately not

00:10:49.10 gotten stuff that you may get next time yes I feel like I'm surprised you don't

00:10:54.04 get any cereal we yeah I should have done that I just

00:10:57.12 I've had as I said last episode I just went hard on some cinnamon toast crunch

00:11:01.23 over the last few days so cereal just doesn't feel like a thing I'd want to

00:11:05.07 but it's a clear item I [ __ I up I should have put cereal on the list I

00:11:08.12 mean unless there's no milk on the end caps oh I don't drink they're actually

00:11:13.07 oh [ __ ] that isn't that is actually there was I didn't include that I forgot

00:11:16.20 that in the photos and that's not in the thing I got milk and a thing of butter

00:11:20.23 so huh that butter on an encap too they own like the deli section end cap

00:11:26.02 yes what wasn't on the end cap yeah this should be that should be a feature that

00:11:31.02 should be all Canadian super supermarkets should just advertise come

00:11:35.11 to Canadian supermarkets all in caps all the time never go down an aisle kind

00:11:39.12 did I not say yeah I think I forgot to save them I'll pull it up right now it

00:11:44.02 was like a deli that's where I got the fruit too

00:11:46.06 there was really only one end cap that had meaningful food outside of that

00:11:51.07 there it's just snacks it's mainly rows of chips and salsa

00:11:57.11 and root beer uh it's a disaster as far as doing this

00:12:02.23 I think it's very store dependent on how viable it is as a challenge I might try

00:12:08.13 this challenge myself just out of curiosity I would love to see your

00:12:12.03 results and compare what your end caps are like compared to mine yeah I might

00:12:16.09 try the heb by the office oh that's a that's a very that's a gets a big hub a

00:12:21.12 new hpv uh very fancy heb they're to have a lot of in-cap options for you

00:12:26.12 I'm going to go wide on my pictures that's hey I'm I agree I was a

00:12:31.12 photographer here she took Geoff's master class I think

00:12:36.21 this is the uh the milk butter end cap how is that that's a big one that's just

00:12:43.00 an aisle no it's the the end what do you mean it's at the end of the row I uh

00:12:48.13 it's a transitional end cap I don't want to kick a man when he's got covered but

00:12:54.02 he's photos no each photo each photo weakens your case man I got

00:12:59.05 it I'm saying stop listening to photos listen I'm not helping I hate to say it

00:13:05.01 I'm saying I think your mum has salad creamed it

00:13:08.23 no I don't think so I think we we're very clear I'd be shocked

00:13:13.01 and you know when you guys come here I can show you this [ __ ] end cap and I

00:13:18.23 wanna expect I wanna be wrong I wanna have so much I want to I want something

00:13:23.22 I need to believe proven wrong we have to go here I I can't wait for you to be

00:13:29.07 proven wrong I feel like I feel like because it's against a wall or something

00:13:35.07 he like there's some kind of trickery going on here where it's like well

00:13:40.12 technically this is again this is the end because

00:13:44.11 it's not an aisle that's what I think is happening that's what I'm anticipating

00:13:49.12 here no it's not it's I think it's if you stood at the front of the store let's

00:13:55.01 say like between the aisles see this is what I see

00:13:58.13 listen how it's going already listen to how it's going already

00:14:03.05 is is that not an end cap the thing at the end that is part if the

00:14:06.15 to the right is definitively if it had chips on it you'd be like that's a

00:14:11.16 [ __ ] end cap yes it's between the two aisles in the front

00:14:16.07 facing wait between two aisles well you know what I mean like when an end cap is

00:14:20.11 always between aisles it's at the end it's the front facing end can you draw a

00:14:25.11 picture and circle what you're talking about no we need a diagram okay

00:14:30.10 uh sure how will I draw this I don't even know how to have a piece of

00:14:33.21 paper and a pencil how did you draw the banana you made

00:14:37.12 that time it was awesome banana by the way so okay I got a here

00:14:41.18 it's just there's too much there's something going on here that like I just

00:14:46.10 I need to lie I'm trying to figure out how they've conspired together yeah 100

00:14:51.12 because here's the thing I don't think his mom

00:14:54.01 did it purposefully like I don't think she really went like I'm gonna really

00:14:58.10 get them here but I do think that it's in their dna

00:15:02.10 that is exactly I was gonna say I have salad cream running through my veins so

00:15:07.21 it is very possible this has curd but it's not it's not anyone's fault so

00:15:12.22 I'm going to draw a line okay we got a line we've got a line that's an hour

00:15:19.07 how he says these things and then says but it's not my fault

00:15:28.06 he's already diverting to genetics it's really something like it was just by

00:15:34.15 food that's at the end of an

00:15:38.20 aisle it's like against the wall he's gonna draw the whole grocery store and

00:15:44.22 do like magic tricks no no no no no no no no let me let me take a photo of this

00:15:50.11 okay we got it we got a line what no how am I supposed to draw

00:15:59.07 Geoff why don't Geoff what do you think we're about to see I'll I'll wait until

00:16:04.18 you answer I'm gonna tell you what we're about to

00:16:08.07 see we're about to see gold we're about to see absolute gold no no no no no this

00:16:14.01 is I feel very clearly this is what an end cap is you have the line going down

00:16:19.14 that's the aisle and then two nails standing

00:16:26.13 you want me to put [ __ ] lays in the corner you want some chickpeas what are

00:16:32.18 you lazy if you tweeted that if you tweeted that said what did I draw

00:16:37.18 no one would say end cap they would say upside down golf tees

00:16:42.04 I will challenge that right flick it now you'll get you'll get a couple of nails

00:16:48.11 and some golf tees nothing else how is that not how would you draw it

00:16:52.23 that's the lines or the aisles there's two spaces between that you walk in the

00:16:59.11 middle of and the end caps go before the lines

00:17:03.08 you can't go into any of the line part you can't cross the end cap line that's

00:17:08.15 the that's top line tea towel level of effort

00:17:12.07 well what do you want I don't [ __ ]

00:17:14.09 draw I don't understand the criticism what would you do you draw it Gavin I

00:17:19.12 want to see yours show me how you do it I'm not ready with a paper all right

00:17:25.00 hold on oh and I wasn't ready either you think I was ready I asked how do you

00:17:30.20 draw that's how unready I was what did I draw is that all I'm saying yeah okay

00:17:35.20 what did I draw find out we'll see end cap and cat will be quick

00:17:40.21 how would you make adjustments to it I'm drawing okay

00:17:45.01 Geoff are you drawing in a cap are you I'm drawing yeah okay

00:17:49.11 you're gonna have a [ __ ] triangle with the nose at the top of yours I've

00:17:53.12 seen your drawings I mean for Geoff it's not really about what he draws it's

00:17:57.02 about the picture that we get of it if it's gonna be able to be like really

00:18:01.07 visible the first reply was flamingo legs wow that was fast two plungers

00:18:08.17 two a lot of two plungers I mean nobody this is just gonna be chicken legs you

00:18:14.23 really like you [ __ ] yourself what a bad idea what a bad idea it was no

00:18:22.12 what a bad idea I literally have no idea I guess candlesticks what did I draw is

00:18:29.01 what you wrote that's incredible no one there are I'm looking at 15

00:18:33.20 replies and no one has guessed what you draw like th you're this insane hmm well

00:18:40.06 I know yeah get yourself in bud I no I feel like I accurately with

00:18:45.12 contact thank you Geoff oh [ __ ] look at you show off over here you got

00:18:50.08 [ __ ] so many lines so many aisles I think it speaks for itself

00:18:55.11 uh at the front you have three checkout counters with three checkout people then

00:19:00.06 you have three long rows and you can see

00:19:02.07 I drew arrows to the things that you can eat

00:19:05.00 it says stuff to eat and then at the back it says stuff to eat next to the

00:19:08.13 meat counter and then in the middle it says off limits because you're not

00:19:12.00 allowed to eat any of that stuff I feel like that's pretty solid I see a

00:19:15.10 lot of wasted lines if I'm going to be critical of this I see a lot of

00:19:19.02 unnecessary information you're creating a lore I think if you tweeted this image

00:19:24.21 and said what did I draw everyone say groceries that's a different argument

00:19:28.22 that's not what I just didn't come into I'm gonna tweet a thing that I drew and

00:19:32.18 see how many people get it right like that wasn't the goal it was contextually

00:19:37.07 within this conversation of what an end cap is I just it's the minimal I did a

00:19:42.08 minimal but clear where the end cap zone is definitely

00:19:46.06 minimal Andrew yeah it was yeah why am I going all out we all know what an egg

00:19:50.02 cap is andrew's art is like jazz it's what he didn't draw oh my god

00:19:55.20 oh you're taking a while Kevin um my Microsoft paint crashed oh I see

00:20:02.02 I thought you're adding a teller and giving them a name and a whole [ __ ]

00:20:06.13 back story back story great yeah they work here part-time this is phoebe she

00:20:10.17 she's been working here for six months while she's saving up to go back to

00:21:10.19 why I just thought it was an empty row no I should have like blanked it out

00:21:14.12 it's okay I mean that that does not exist in a grocery store that space

00:21:18.06 well it's just top of the shelf I understand it's not that it's not it's

00:21:23.01 not that spaced out that's a that's the same size as your rose

00:21:31.04 I'm making it work you're trying my best you're doing a great job buddy honestly

00:21:35.05 it's way better than what I expected I just I didn't realize I was gonna get

00:21:39.07 called out for the uh next time you asked me to draw something oh there's

00:21:42.14 gonna be complexity and I do not want to hear dude you drew one of the best

00:21:45.21 bananas I've ever seen last time we've actually drawn something

00:21:48.22 it is a great banana we were just expecting that quality emily's insult of

00:21:53.00 my drawing was so funny what was it was like um what did she say she said that I

00:21:57.05 draw like an innocent child I think that's what she said it was so funny I

00:22:01.09 don't remember the exact wording but it was perfect it's a great descriptor

00:22:07.01 yeah well you definitely you definitely draw golf [Laughter]

00:22:10.21 nails and golf tees like an innocent child uh well what are some of the other

00:22:15.20 responses to your tweet oh let me let me open it back up I closed it at flamingo

00:22:19.18 legs um thanks Gavin just you know for clary gather yeah that's now you know

00:22:24.02 what I would have no questions that's where they store all their grown tubes

00:22:29.01 there are 52 replies and none of them have guessed right

00:22:33.14 traffic cones big bird legs the pull chains for a ceiling fan.

00:22:40.21 I think the the color choice is really turning people's uh opinions

00:22:45.09 yeah I couldn't find a pen let's just call my head

00:22:48.23 well I I'll use like a felt thing an art brush what did I use uh

00:22:56.19 pit artist pawn brush I'm mainly annoyed that I'm not annoyed

00:23:01.18 I'm disappointed that your photo doesn't

00:23:04.09 show anything about your life other than

00:23:06.10 the picture usually there's a glimpse of oh yeah on the side but it's just

00:23:10.00 completely drawing yeah we usually get a little unintended Andrew but

00:23:14.23 it is I don't know I drew it on the instructions for an

00:23:20.19 electric s'mores maker that I received recently that is

00:23:24.23 next to me so I just need like a candle like a little flame no remember before I

00:23:30.08 was melting the marshmallows with the candle

00:23:33.03 and I was told that that is a terrible idea that you're essentially eating wax

00:23:37.05 yeah so uh for my birthday I was given uh an electric s'mores maker what is it

00:23:41.23 it's just like a heat gun or like what what's going on it's it's uh yeah it's

00:23:47.05 just like a ah what's the that that's what it is oh

00:23:50.19 it's got like a heat spool inside you flip the switch is that just like a

00:23:55.22 dewalt heat gun with the smallest holder on the side sort of

00:24:00.08 does the does the chocolate not melt just being in proximity of the

00:24:04.10 the heat gun I it might I don't know I've never had it with chocolate around

00:24:08.07 it I have toasted some marshmallows it works great it's a great product I like

00:24:12.05 that it's 360. Like you have access to every size oh yeah full turns yeah yeah

00:24:16.12 it's perfect I would try that is that electric uh what do you mean by that do

00:24:20.09 you plug it in and use electricity or is it well it hasn't

00:24:23.11 button yeah oh yeah it does it's nice yeah you plug it I just didn't see the

00:24:26.10 on button sorry that's why I was confused that works great yeah what have

00:24:30.03 you made what what thing shouldn't you have made with it that you made

00:24:34.08 I wondered if I could no I haven't done ramen I have considered toast

00:24:37.23 uh I think it could work with toast I have had those thoughts of what could I

00:24:42.09 do with this I wondered if I could if I could like heat up hash browns

00:24:47.09 maybe with it it'd be tough you know what I'm pan on top I bet you could do

00:24:52.19 you've got those real fruit plant-based mellow medley melange gummies I'm

00:24:58.08 looking at I bet you could melt all those down and then form them into one

00:25:03.03 giant gummy in a shape of your choosing I bet you could have a gummy

00:25:07.15 infused s'more oh that sounds terrible definitely I don't I don't want that you

00:25:13.03 could death crackers yeah but between the the marshmallow and

00:25:18.06 the chalky a nice slab of gummies nah no thanks

00:25:20.20 I like the meltdown idea that's you're going somewhere with that I'm gonna

00:25:23.20 think about that you know how sometimes when you have gum or like a candy and

00:25:27.15 you squeeze it and then there's like a like a burst of flavor from the middle

00:25:32.00 that's like some sort of a jelly or whatever you could

00:25:36.03 you could invent uh a new product that people get into like s'mores where

00:25:41.05 you cut a hole like a little slit in in a marshmallow

00:25:45.00 and then you stuff the gummy in there and then let it close back up and then

00:25:48.15 when you heat that then when you eat it you get a little a little

00:25:53.09 melted gummy surprise that hey that's not a I've heard worse ideas

00:25:57.16 if you could really draw for me what you're thinking I'd appreciate that in

00:26:00.21 great detail to really that'll sell me I'm not gonna do that but sure

00:26:05.01 I don't think that one needs it you know

00:26:07.07 what no I will I don't think any of them needed it a lot of big bird likes

00:26:12.19 someone will get it no one will get it someone eventually will get it I think

00:26:17.00 uh contextually you know what it was though within the context of the

00:26:20.23 conversation were happening it made sense

00:26:23.08 I'm excited to see uh I'm excited what are you doing are you actually drawing

00:26:27.12 something you asked me to draw that's right I was just being silly

00:26:31.12 I draw stuff it was not a hard one what does it say on your drawing there

00:26:37.05 Geoff stuff stuff to pot all of the drawings will be on Instagram

00:26:42.04 just by the way yeah of course it's the area that's safe for him to eat stuff

00:26:48.15 uh boom there you go that's good gummy marshmallow yeah that works

00:26:55.05 I think I suppose this is science I think it's mostly yeah it's going a it's

00:26:59.07 an a I imagine I apologize for that uh I can I can redo that

00:27:04.06 I'm excited for the updated picture

00:27:08.17 I'll let you know how the chickens go how are you going to cook them uh

00:27:13.12 probably oven just in the oven speed them up throw some salt pepper on it

00:27:16.23 maybe I don't know I guess I can't [ __ ]

00:27:20.19 I can't season it yeah you I can't see that that's the problem

00:27:24.03 you didn't buy any drink well I assumed that I could just have water I don't pay

00:27:28.03 for like like most of I drink water a lot of the time that's fair I didn't

00:27:31.20 consider that I think I would need a drink I just don't want you you know

00:27:36.00 getting pepsis out of the fridge or whatever

00:27:39.09 how long do you have to do this for I think it was a week right so yeah

00:27:43.22 starting today or tomorrow depending on if I cook the

00:27:47.07 chickens oh I'll stir today update the photo for you that's great you didn't

00:35:56.04 before I went on survive block island I dm'd like three survivor winners being

00:36:01.07 like I got any tips didn't hear back from any of them

00:36:05.09 no replies from any of them who did you hit up I I dm'd uh

00:36:13.05 Tyson Adam and Michelle I think Michelle okay Fitzgerald Adam

00:36:17.12 klein and Tyson apostle speaking of Tyson are you keeping up with the uh the

00:36:23.03 challenge usa yeah I've wanted to text you about it dude that I just watched

00:36:27.15 the most recent episode ty well the swimming episode where Tyson had to

00:36:32.02 drag uh that person from love island is Tyson the greatest reality tv show

00:36:36.23 competitor of all time that was insane that he won that that was insane

00:36:41.18 well he swam he was like a competitive swimmer in college and he got a college

00:36:45.16 scholarship through swimming they had to do this challenge gav where they're on

00:36:50.08 one boat and they have to jump off a boat and I mean like like a

00:36:54.11 I don't know like an old rusty like like some sort of a work boat it's not a

00:36:59.12 pretty boat it's not a yacht or anything and they have to dive off like maybe

00:37:04.23 1012 feet into the water and they swim 450

00:37:08.15 feet I believe or 450 yards and then they have to look at a like a

00:37:13.03 I don't know something bobbing in the water and on it as a code like a

00:37:17.10 numerical code of like 10 digits then they have to swim another 100 yards

00:37:21.13 climb up onto another boat and then there's a ton of barrels and on the top

00:37:24.19 of the barrels and when I say a ton I mean like 60 barrels and the barrels

00:37:28.01 have different number patterns on the top and they have to run around and find

00:37:31.06 their pattern open it up if they get the wrong one they have to swim all the way

00:37:34.19 back and start over again if they get the right one they take two puzzle

00:37:38.09 pieces or a pile of puzzle pieces and then they have to start all over again

00:37:41.19 and go back and do it again to find the second barrel and then to retrieve all

00:37:45.14 their puzzle pieces and the guy Tyson who you'd know from survivor he uh

00:37:50.01 like the blond dude with the ponytail who won and was on like three or four

00:37:54.08 times he his partner wasn't a very strong swimmer and so he

00:37:58.02 she just laid back like on her back and he pulled her the entire time and then

00:38:03.02 when they got there she opened up the wrong barrel so they had to go back to

00:38:06.09 the beginning and do it all over again so he had to do it an extra time

00:38:11.05 and pull her through the entirety of it while

00:38:14.22 swimming and he he still won and beat like 10 other teams it was insane it's a

00:38:20.06 great episode it's a great season it's especially the last few have really uh

00:38:24.21 amped up I'm enjoying it quite a bit there's a dude from uh another dude from

00:38:29.02 survivor who was a nfl player who had I don't remember his name but he had like

00:38:32.08 long dreadlocks and he's like a real muscular dude and he talked about he's

00:38:35.16 like I'm not the best swimmer in the world but looking over while I'm

00:38:39.14 swimming and seeing Tyson swim past me pulling somebody is maybe one of the

00:38:43.03 most depressing things I've ever experienced he was like I never felt

00:38:46.06 more like crying in my life that was Danny and he was an excellent nfl player

00:38:49.21 it's one of my favorite reality bits in a long time every single episode he

00:38:54.12 references his wife in some way to what is happening and it's great it doesn't

00:38:59.04 matter what they're doing like they'll be in the most recent episode they had

00:39:03.08 to jump off of a high thing in the water

00:39:05.09 and he's just like my wife kiki and I we

00:39:07.12 went on vacation and she jumped off this big rock so then I had to jump off the

00:39:11.09 big rock so thank you kiki for preparing me for this moment every [ __ ] episode

00:39:15.21 we're like seven episodes in and there's at least one kiki mentioned per episode

00:39:21.01 and yeah that's fantastic it's you almost wonder like

00:39:24.01 he he makes every opportunity he gets on

00:39:25.19 camera to go like hey just so y'all know I love my wife a lot and she's awesome

00:39:29.07 and she's the best and she's my she's my motivation for everything in life just

00:39:31.16 just just saying that I haven't said it yet today on camera so just so you guys

00:39:35.05 know yeah it's one of three things either he

00:39:39.01 as a joke like made an agreement that he would bring his like him and his wife

00:39:42.18 had like a bet of like I bet you I could bring you up every episode that's

00:39:46.13 happening or he just naturally talks about his

00:39:50.01 wife kiki all the time or the people that are interviewing him for those

00:39:55.05 interviews like noticed it was a thing and have like set him up to do it every

00:39:58.17 episode either way it's great I'm loving it or fourth he got in trouble and he's

00:40:03.09 apologizing every chance he can on camera just throwing that out there just

00:40:07.13 reminding everybody I love my wife she's the best I'm saying to Gavin I was

00:40:11.14 trying to get him to watch it Geoff a great moment from this season of when

00:40:15.10 every episode they change partners uh yeah and so they're getting ready to

00:40:19.10 do this challenge and before it starts Tyson is like trying to hype them hype

00:40:23.03 up him and his partner talking about how they're like they're gonna win and he's

00:40:27.05 like somebody in the house said that they rode 12 miles on a bike once that's

00:40:31.00 not even a warm-up and then his partner laughed and said Tyson I'm the one who

00:40:36.17 said that and he like so genuinely looked at them was like oh [ __ ] you were

00:40:41.06 Alyssa 12 miles is not even a warm-up

00:40:44.10 it's great it's a very good season I've had a you know um you know I've had

00:40:49.11 problems in the past with like carpet mushrooms and sink mushrooms yeah I

00:40:53.19 forgot but yes I'm always just afraid of like your life is like it follows with

00:40:59.09 mushrooms yeah I just don't want to die of like inhaling mold so I'm always

00:41:04.02 slightly wary of stuff and I found I had this little canvas lent up against my

00:41:09.06 wall in my office it's like under my desk and I moved it recently and

00:41:14.08 on the skirt I'm just like oh that's that looks like water damage looks like

00:41:22.23 some rot um so then we had people out checking the roof

00:41:27.14 turns out yeah there's a there's a hole in the roof it's just like been leaking

00:41:32.11 down into the into the house so the guy was like yeah

00:41:35.19 we should probably take a look in the wall and uh I guess in my head I thought

00:41:39.08 you know he's just gonna fill a little hole and snake a camera in maybe

00:41:43.15 and he and uh I'm just let him into my office and uh he eventually was like

00:41:47.04 yeah it's all good in the wall it must have been just like a tiny amount of

00:41:50.05 water that's just done that through the wood but

00:41:53.16 there's there's no like pooling water in there there's no

00:41:57.09 there's no real damage so uh yep you're all good and then I went into my office.

00:42:02.20 [Laughter]

00:42:04.12 Oh thanks thanks for uh cutting open three different holes [Laughter]

00:42:12.12 that's not an easy repair I thought I'd be able to patch it not the way he cut

00:42:18.05 it it's not and they're so jank like he didn't even

00:42:22.07 make him square I don't know what we're gonna do with that I I'll tell you one

00:42:25.20 thing you're gonna do you're gonna cut more away you're not fitting you're like

00:42:29.17 the first thing to do you have to do is make that hole bigger unfortunately he's

00:42:33.16 got between three different studs all the jauntiest angles

00:42:38.15 and then he stacked up all the pieces like a puzzle next to it it was like he

00:42:43.20 made his cuts on a teeter-totter the way they go up and down

00:42:48.07 there's no reason for it to be that why would he do it that way that's so bad

00:42:54.03 so did you get your roof repaired yeah yeah

00:42:57.05 that's uh that's sorted out and I I was expecting a much more dire situation

00:43:02.06 I mean if you hadn't moved that picture you would have had them the uh the only

00:43:05.22 thing saving you probably the only thing saving you

00:43:09.00 in the world is that it hasn't rained in Texas in 900 days yeah yeah except that

00:43:13.15 it did rain yesterday a little bit on my

00:43:15.10 house I don't know if it rained it years these are the the puzzle pieces he left

00:43:22.00 those those puzzle pieces fit right in the trash [Laughter]

00:43:33.22 I've always like you know carefully taken off like a yeah I don't know like

00:43:38.12 a network panel and I've been snaking up cables through tiny holes I never

00:43:42.03 thought to just gouge the entire wall open because that would have saved me so

00:43:46.17 much sweat and time like is that an easy fix what do I do with that

00:43:50.08 I mean it's an easy fix for some people yeah I would hire probably someone to do

00:43:55.22 it uh is this something you want is it it's not hard

00:44:00.04 you're just gonna need to buy wall board and cuts

00:44:04.21 cut it well you're gonna have to you're gonna have to straighten that [ __ ] out

00:44:09.22 that is a mess first and then is that thing to the left it

00:44:14.08 that's uh looks like it's covered in insulation is that a pipe or something

00:44:19.07 or is that a two by four just looks like another stud with installation foam

00:44:24.12 okay okay so you can you can hammer or screw into that safely yeah okay

00:44:32.00 yeah you could do that that's a that's a

00:44:34.10 couple that's like a two-hour project on a Saturday you want me to help you you

00:44:38.00 want help you want me to come help you do it [Laughter]

00:44:41.20 that'd be good content I've never done I've never done a patch job

00:44:45.05 that big before but how hard could it be I mean I'm tempted just to put the

00:44:50.02 puzzle pieces back in and just I don't know patch it all back in

00:44:53.11 you can try I mean we could try that first say it save you money and time if

00:44:57.09 you can do that [Laughter]

00:44:59.16 I really want Geoff to come over and for you guys to cut more out and then

00:45:03.10 somehow [ __ ] up more and gavin's just gonna have to replace the whole wall

00:45:06.14 like every attempt just incrementally makes it a larger hole it doesn't

00:45:11.03 actually fix the problem is that the back leg of a desk that I'm

00:45:14.10 seeing in the photo yeah that's my I'm sat at that desk now so okay so that's

00:45:18.21 under where your feet are yeah okay has the cat gotten it are any of

00:45:23.20 the cats gotten in there yet yeah yeah they will you know

00:45:27.07 cats cats are getting your walls yeah yeah make sure they can't like climb up

00:45:30.22 any higher but there's just tons of other insulation that they can't get

00:45:34.19 past so that's fine when I was like 14 or 15 we're

00:45:38.21 renovating a bathroom and like we took out the back of

00:45:42.09 the tub wall and then our cat hopped down the hole and we couldn't get it out

00:45:47.05 so we had to like cut half the other wall open to be able to reach the cat

00:45:51.14 like it just caught it delayed the project by months and made everything so

00:45:55.22 much more expensive because that dumb cat hopped down the smallest hole and

00:46:00.10 just had no way to get out it was impossible

00:46:02.17 it's a disaster I'm glad that your cats are able to get in and out oh they love

00:46:06.07 a new hole yeah it's one of their favorite things yeah I was kind of

00:46:09.13 worried that there would just be a gap like all the way down through the floor

00:46:12.13 that they could fall in but it that there is there is like a floor there so

00:46:15.12 that's good good are you is this on the first floor of your house yeah it's

00:46:19.08 upstairs that's upstairs oh okay and it didn't drip any further down

00:46:23.13 nope oh yeah you must have caught it really fast and also benefited from the

00:46:27.08 fact that we're in a tremendous drought do you have a fridge Geoff yeah are you

00:46:30.23 still waiting for your fridge did it ever arrive well is it February of 2023

00:46:36.02 okay I just wanted to check it no I don't I

00:46:39.11 have I still have a fridge I still have I I have a fridge that I feel like do

00:46:44.09 you know how like sometimes you'll look at your you'll just check to see what's

00:46:48.15 my what's my max iPhone battery at now and you're like as

00:46:52.01 long as it's like over like 9596 I'm still good I don't need to worry about

00:46:55.11 replacing it you know and you'll look and it'll be like oh 98 still oh that's

00:46:59.01 cool I'm still still got a lot of good battery life uh in this battery

00:47:02.20 sometimes like when I got rid of my last phone my battery was like it was like

00:47:06.07 your max charge can get to 87 I was like [ __ ] that I gotta get a new phone

00:47:11.14 uh I uh I assume what the [ __ ] was I talking about

00:47:17.22 new fridge oh yeah my fridge my fridge if I could

00:47:22.13 check ah damn man I'm getting dumb my uh my fridge

00:47:27.14 I would estimate the max capacity uh uh would if it were an iPhone battery would

00:47:32.17 be like 78 percent right now and like cooling ability yeah just like

00:47:37.11 function ability functionality and I would say it was like it was probably

00:47:41.13 like in the 80s uh earlier this year so I'm thinking by the

00:47:45.20 end of the year it might be in the high 60s like it's it's it's it's

00:47:50.23 I can feel it dying a little bit every day I'm just

00:47:54.19 hoping against hope that it doesn't die until

00:47:57.08 February how many percent a month do you think you're losing I think I'm losing

00:48:01.04 two or three percent a month right now okay

00:48:03.14 and what are you currently at I think I'm in the 70s I think I was I think I

00:48:07.13 was probably in the high 80s when this whole thing started and then I think you

00:48:11.19 know what [ __ ] dude maybe I'm in the low 70s right now yeah

00:48:15.19 I think I'm being too optimistic I think

00:48:17.12 I'm in the low 70s right now and I could dip into the 60s before the summer's

00:48:23.03 over Andrew what percentage a month do your ankles lose

00:48:26.07 right now we're flying at a steady hundred percent and we're going to keep

00:48:30.01 it that way until like with covid you're at 100 that's pretty impressive yeah

00:48:34.07 well something always has to be wrong so I think it's going to trade off we went

00:48:37.20 upper body instead of the lower body dude the second you get over that kovid

00:48:43.16 you're going to get jock itch watch out oh I hope not that would be

00:48:47.09 ugh it's not terrible does this help you

00:48:50.21 come to the us any sooner having covered now oh no oh

00:48:55.07 not really you'll be like super immune for a while yeah natural immunity for a

00:48:59.22 bit yeah the best time for you to come would be like next week probably

00:49:04.00 I don't um there's I think I would go to the us

00:49:06.20 either for like a scheduled event or it would be completely unannounced and I'd

00:49:11.12 just do it who are you hiding from nobody I just I I think I think it would

00:49:16.13 be funny to record one of these in Texas without telling you guys and

00:49:22.10 just to be like hey last week I was in Austin recording no I don't think I'd do

00:49:26.23 it then I think I would I'd want to spend time with both of you and everyone

00:49:30.12 everyone else here why do you want to hide from us and not mention it

00:49:34.14 well no I think it would be funny to do it though within the context of a bit of

00:49:38.08 an episode reveal at the end then obviously spend time from there probably

00:49:42.02 like a week so just one day I'd schedule it so like

00:49:45.07 on a Thursday would be like day one so are you coming here first or are we

00:49:49.14 going there first that's I I don't know let me sound like you were coming in

00:49:53.22 November let me ask you a question Andrew how are you at patching drywall

00:50:00.00 maybe maybe I'm a savant at it we don't know I've never done it probably not

00:50:05.03 good probably terrible I'd love to hire you for a job I have

00:50:16.00 okay so if I was so hmm let me look at this hole how I would

00:50:20.10 solve this problem not knowing anything what I would need I would need

00:50:26.12 uh some glue I would need some nails I would need paint

00:50:30.19 and I would need another wall

00:50:35.16 what are you doing he's gonna glue the puzzle back together

00:50:40.06 or yeah so initially I thought maybe I glue but then I realized with nails you

00:50:45.19 brought up a great point I could nail maybe I just need what um okay so I get

00:50:50.23 wood I nail between slats right make it solid how do I make a wall

00:50:59.03 hey can I craft the wall you sound like someone who's shopping

00:51:03.07 from the end caps of home depot you know what [ __ ] sucks about this

00:51:08.21 looking at it a little closer he's cut or they they have cut

00:51:13.12 two and I think I suspect in some spots below your floorboard there

00:51:19.16 so that's probably gonna have to come off the screen yeah yeah to repair this

00:51:24.15 and that's [ __ ] annoying and above that I like that he's just gouged a line

00:51:30.05 where he clearly went up a bit too high yeah oh yeah yeah

00:51:34.10 you can see his skill saw kept going yeah I think if I had to repair this

00:51:39.13 realistically I would just put a larger piece of wood over it and then paint it

00:51:43.15 to look like something else I would just fully cover the wall yeah

00:51:48.06 this doesn't look like he's used any sort of power tool to me it just looks

00:51:52.00 like he's got like a hand held drywall saw and just gone absolutely ape [ __ ]

00:51:56.20 not tried to make any corners I think

00:52:01.14 how how committed are you to fixing this yourself versus paying to get somebody

00:52:06.15 to do it for you I mean I like doing stuff

00:52:08.18 myself I just wouldn't really know where to start with this all right well I

00:52:13.12 don't have any skills I'm telling you man I uh I am more than happy to come

00:52:18.04 over this weekend and figure this out how hard can it be I've patched walls

00:52:22.12 before you're gonna need we're gonna need uh

00:52:25.18 some probably some new wall board we're gonna need some of that mesh

00:52:30.13 uh that you put uh that you then like apply like joint compound to to and then

00:52:35.14 we'll need the um uh the sandpaper that you wrap around the

00:52:39.04 stone or like that the rubber thing to smooth it out and then we'll just need

00:52:43.07 primer and whatever color paint you have we can do that no glue

00:52:47.12 no I think we're gonna be okay without glue

00:52:50.17 I think we'll be fine and I don't think we'll use any nails either I think we'll

00:52:55.20 probably use screws well you guys figured that out I will draw step by

00:52:59.10 step how I would fix this and I'll send it to you just in case you have any

00:53:02.13 issues if you need to be much appreciated and we can only follow your

00:53:07.12 instructions now that is a recipe for a great bit for face if you're willing to

00:53:12.17 to let that happen to your house Kevin either way we've got content because

00:53:17.00 even if I do hire some guy to fix this I could

00:53:20.12 we can keep all the pieces of wool for the museum that's true

00:53:24.20 I hope you'll get creative with your solutions Andrew to give us a more fun

00:53:29.21 and robust experience trying to fix this wall what about a staple gun

00:53:34.10 nail gun that could be good yeah we could use it you know what else we could

00:53:38.10 do gav yeah we've got your wall opened up we could

00:53:41.11 put in uh we could put in something in into your wall for somebody time capsule

00:53:45.15 little time capsule yeah a little bit load of old razor face time capsule

00:53:50.05 oh my god yeah we could just put in a bunch of razor blades from 2022.

00:53:54.14 People rip over the wall be like this wasn't even a bathroom.

00:54:02.23 I like the idea of the face time capsule though that should definitely go

00:54:07.09 somewhere yeah in your wall or in the bean hole or in a beetle that's true oh

00:54:13.07 oh that reminds me Eric said we should start wrapping up uh I had an idea

00:54:17.07 yesterday I was looking at the pictures Eric took

00:54:20.10 from the does it do shoot it got me thinking should we make an end of the

00:54:24.13 year like 2022 face yearbook kind of like high school with like funny

00:54:29.08 like photos from throughout the year and funny moments it would essentially be

00:54:32.11 like the plused up version of the zine we never made yeah that'd be kind of

00:54:37.09 cool right like a year a year in review year and a year uh like a memories book

00:54:41.09 of like of the last year [ __ ] face and

00:54:43.15 would be is that just like a single item or is that something we make and sell

00:54:47.05 well I think we'd sell it yeah we would make it and print it and sell it and

00:54:49.11 then you could get you could we could autograph each other's books and give

00:54:52.21 each other oh that's the sweetest we could put in

00:54:56.12 the the current face shirt that's for sale too

00:54:59.16 yeah that's true but only an extra medium

00:55:03.01 you'd be like yeah like hey really had it really had a fun time with you at a

00:55:07.16 place in this year Andrew and uh uh really really excited

00:55:10.19 that things are going so well with your ankles uh good luck next year see in

00:55:15.20 2023 you know can the next shirt we sell just have xm in the collar

00:55:20.15 it's not a real thing so no that's for medium large what you're

00:55:24.23 looking for is an I yeah he's wrong he's not he's so right I'm very right

00:55:30.15 it's weird it's weird because what is the gap between medium to large

00:55:36.02 what are we working on.

00:55:41.16 I bet you there's room for an extra medium

00:55:45.03 I need to draw a dime if there is room for if there's room for an extra medium

00:55:49.12 it would be larger than a medium and smaller than a large so it would not be

00:55:54.21 what gavin's asking for what do you mean so I just I searched shirt sizes

00:55:59.16 chest and inches medium 38 inch to 40

00:56:02.20 inch large 41-43 so you're looking at like a 40.5

00:56:06.15 would be an extra medium that's a millenium I'm making a diagram here okay

00:56:14.23 what's the psi I'm excited for the diagram no I'm jazzed that was a sigh of

00:56:20.06 excitement that was I've never heard of the less genuine I was just I'm excited

00:56:25.11 jazz are you kidding me so this I just need to be gonna draw a

00:56:30.19 [ __ ] diagram to show us all how you're wrong I mean what are you gonna

00:56:35.11 draw just a shirt and then another shirt like I could draw it too Gavin

00:56:41.06 yeah draw extra medium I will okay how do I try to how do I make the pencil

00:56:46.19 thick yeah okay then this bit okay please please don't cut any of this out

00:56:52.00 nick yeah make sure this is the gold this is the good I'm jazzing about this

00:56:55.09 so let's keep

00:56:58.21 taking a photo so Eric while they're drawing uh to get

00:57:02.19 ready for face today I didn't have I don't have anything planned uh and so I

00:57:07.22 thought real fast I'd look up I just looked up uh

00:57:11.02 wacky like baseball facts and I found like 35 insane baseball facts and here's

00:57:15.03 one a lot of it's stuff we already know and a lot of stuff that's not super

00:57:18.21 interesting but here's one that I was not aware of let me see if you've heard

00:57:22.02 of uh in the mid 1800s you could get out or be put out uh while running between

00:57:27.06 the bases by having the ball thrown directly at you yeah thrown at you 1880s

00:57:32.12 baseball was you and out would be off of one bounce like when hit to like the

00:57:37.09 outfield but also you could hit one of the runners with the baseball

00:57:42.17 yeah they would be out it's pretty cool it was they changed it in the mid 1800s

00:57:46.22 uh and players were resistant to the change which by the way getting hit by

00:57:51.18 somebody just [ __ ] being in the ball like you did not to throw and knock you

00:57:56.02 out it was called patching and uh and uh players didn't want to get rid of it

00:58:01.20 because they considered it an important and masculine part of the game well a

00:58:05.21 thing they used to do also was uh you could call for where you wanted the ball

00:58:12.02 to be pitched to you you could ask for it high or low

00:58:16.04 and then what happened was I think the uh I think babe Ruth and the

00:58:20.23 rest of murderers row went give it to me

00:58:20.23 high and crushed a million home runs and they went well this rule is different

00:58:26.08 now uh so that that rule changed crazy right that's pretty crazy did you

00:58:31.19 know that during world war ii the united states military military designed

00:58:35.14 grenades to be the size and weight of baseballs since every young American man

00:58:39.19 should be able to properly throw it isn't that cool that's really that makes

00:58:43.04 sense I think that's really cool I think that's awesome

00:58:46.04 I think that's pretty neat too is that why we won the war

00:58:50.06 I would assume so it would have ended a lot quicker if Geoff was out there

00:58:53.08 throwing 80 mile per hour grenades

00:58:56.23 I'll throw an 80 mile 80 mile per hour ball right around the time you do a

00:59:03.03 marathon how about that uh this is gavin's drawing an incredibly

00:59:06.23 detailed drawing I assume well I'm just waiting for um Microsoft paint to

00:59:11.12 unfreeze again every time I save it it freezes for about a minute I'm long

00:59:15.18 done with the drawing okay so Andrew just drew

00:59:19.14 that's the tag on the inside of the shirt oh that's the tag on the shirt

00:59:24.01 14.5 extra medium okay I like that very quick that's that's way

00:59:27.18 better that's way better way better than the nails you do earlier all right now

00:59:32.00 tweet and say what did I draw sponges Geoff

00:59:34.18 that's still uh did it unfreeze yet you take a picture on your phone or

00:59:38.15 something I mean it's eventually gonna save

00:59:41.02 well that's will it oh oh there we go I like that your computer can't handle

00:59:46.19 ms paint here you can put your musk I bet your

00:59:50.04 computer would catch on fire if you try to play freestyle

00:59:54.12 what I I think I won hey hey guys all yours all all yours I don't have

01:00:00.20 anything to say about that okay okay okay okay okay

01:00:05.22 for the audience who may not be able to see this

01:00:10.04 uh he has denoted the following sizes in this order extra small small medium

01:00:16.12 extra medium medium again large extra large

01:00:22.06 I am a little confused by going from medium to extra medium back to medium if

01:00:28.19 it's extra medium it couldn't be more medium so that means the other variants

01:00:34.00 of medium have to be on either side of it

01:00:38.11 there's literally one more on the right of extra medium that is more medium you

01:00:43.22 you are if its scale is increasing extra small is it more small it's

01:00:51.07 smaller than small extra large isn't is more large

01:00:55.12 extra medium is more medium you can't you what you're doing is you're flying in

01:01:00.21 the face I understand that extra small and extra large are are polar opposites

01:01:06.10 right like they they flip the script on that it's weird oh my god like extra

01:01:10.14 small smaller than small but extra large is larger than large I get that's

01:01:14.10 confusing but you can't take you can't take the best of both and cram them

01:01:18.23 together and have medium extra medium medium again

01:01:21.18 they're all the same [ __ ] size man I I think that's the marketing slogan for

01:01:26.15 extra money that's when there's only one black line

01:01:30.08 below media but my point is is the extra medium is not large

01:01:35.16 from now on on the it's just medium store do we have to sell

01:01:39.15 small extra medium and large we don't sell regular mediums anymore we sell

01:01:44.04 extra I think they should all be extra medium

01:01:46.05 whatever that means to whoever's buying this and then we just get people mad

01:01:50.21 because it's actually just medium and not a larger medium

01:01:53.14 if you were buying if you wanted extra medium and you got medium you cannot be

01:01:58.15 disappointed there I think all you've showed is

01:02:00.22 disappointment that's all I felt looking at this thing this is the face

01:02:04.21 of disappointment but if you had to put it anywhere on

01:02:08.19 that scale where else would you put it other than there

01:02:11.12 I don't I have no idea eric's saying it would be under large oh it would be

01:02:16.09 before large I would put it I'd put it above medium I'd go medium and extra

01:02:20.10 medium in the space before large yeah you're gonna well first off you gotta

01:02:23.21 get a 40.5 there's no need for two mediums at an extra medium you got a

01:02:27.22 medium and an extra medium it's a 4.5

01:02:31.03 40.5

01:02:32.07 oh my god why do we have three mediums we do this one medium

01:02:36.06 he drew he put it he put medium on there twice and is saying there's one medium

01:02:41.21 well he's he's referring to the hash marks he drew but

01:02:45.19 he couldn't have created a more confusing document

01:02:49.17 there's gonna be one person who agrees me that's where that should go on the

01:02:53.07 scale I'm sure out of seven and a half billion

01:02:56.17 people on earth there is one person who will agree with you yeah I I think and I

01:03:01.02 bet we could find that person if we looked hard enough

01:03:06.19 job done all right [Laughter]

01:03:12.13 I I kind of just wanted to give Eric a headache for this

01:03:22.10 two lines for small and two lines for large and one line for medium but three

01:03:27.18 let like [ __ ] this yeah it's it's it's absolutely insane

01:03:32.21 all kinds of Andrew levels of [ __ ]
