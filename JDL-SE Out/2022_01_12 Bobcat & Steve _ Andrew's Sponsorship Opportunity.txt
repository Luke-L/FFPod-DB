00:00:27.03 [Music]

00:00:33.01 I had a thing that happened last night and it made me feel like one of the

00:00:37.11 worst humans I've ever felt probably like a low for me as far as is but it

00:00:41.20 wasn't you know if that makes sense I laughed at it hold on one second okay

00:00:45.13 hold on one second one second hello and welcome to another episode of the face

00:00:49.20 podcast I am Geoff Ramsey with me always Gavin free Andrew Payton Andrew you said

00:00:53.15 you feel like one of the worst humans well I don't I don't know if I want to

00:00:56.16 talk about this because I feel bad because it's not the thing but it was so

00:01:01.22 it's been snowing where I live like way more than usual we got so much snow

00:01:05.14 and uh a lot of people been trapped and I was reading that apparently I don't

00:01:09.11 know if this is true or not this is just

00:01:11.04 like some random Reddit comment that the city I live in has the lowest snow

00:01:15.19 removal budget in bc and so people were like yeah that's why that's why like the

00:01:19.22 snow is not being plowed anywhere it's just there's nothing going on so do you

00:01:24.05 have a plow I don't personally have a plow I'd love to know you but does

00:01:28.08 you'll see yeah my city has one yeah they've got like six I'd assume they've

00:01:32.03 got a few but they're not in use for whatever reason right now or at least it

00:01:36.01 doesn't seem that way uh but last night my entire building started to shake and

00:01:40.04 I was like what the [ __ ] is is that a plow what is that so I walked outside

00:01:43.21 and I couldn't all right I walked to my balcony I couldn't see anything and I

00:01:47.04 walked back in and I saw it again a few moments later so I ran out and it's this

00:01:51.13 [ __ ] bobcat there's this bobcat going down the street that was like plowing

00:01:55.14 the road and like trying to remove snow or ice I

00:01:59.09 guess from the road and uh I looked at that and I was like oh I wonder I wonder

00:02:03.04 what it's doing like how impactful I've never seen a bobcat used as a snowplow

00:02:07.11 and I look behind it and there just happened to be someone in an electric

00:02:12.19 wheelchair like six feet behind it and I started laughing immediately

00:02:16.14 not because of that but because in my head it was like that's the budget of

00:02:20.14 our town it's like they got a bobcat and Steve

00:02:23.20 they're out there trying to get rid of the snow

00:02:27.09 and I felt so bad because I saw it was if you looked at it from a perspective

00:02:31.05 it was me looking at somebody in an electric wheelchair and immediately

00:02:34.11 laughing extremely hard but it was all this context around it and had nothing

00:02:39.05 to do with bobcat and Steve but what was Steve doing no he was just that he was

00:02:42.22 just going down the road it was just a complete coincidence

00:02:46.10 he just happened to be and he was far enough behind that I didn't notice

00:02:50.00 immediately but like he was part of the team like he was within the worst place

00:02:54.02 to be on the road or the best place yeah I was about to say what if I mean

00:02:59.12 to me it sounds like Steve is an incredibly rich successful dude who has

00:03:03.07 his own personal snowplower who snowfalls in front of him everywhere he

00:03:07.03 needs to go whenever he leaves the house Steve sounds like the most baller

00:03:10.13 [ __ ] dude ever like that's like way better than a red carpet I just felt

00:03:14.17 horrible in the moment because it was like I looked at and it was not enough

00:03:18.22 they're removing the white carpet [Laughter]

00:03:22.21 so that was my my evening oh man how's Christmas this is great

00:03:27.18 that reminds me real fast that reminds me you and I had a conversation

00:03:31.13 yesterday the day before just brief where I asked how the weather was in

00:03:36.02 Canada which is like the lamest question to ask which is why

00:03:39.11 like how's the weather over there it's like that's not you [ __ ] is that what

00:03:42.19 our friendship is you know we're down to

00:03:44.20 asking about the weather so I I I try to do it at every opportunity and you sent

00:03:49.03 me a picture of snow and it I couldn't it it broke my brain to think that you

00:03:55.07 were snowed in at the exact same time Gavin I assume you can corroborate this

00:03:59.10 and Eric and nick uh it was 87 [ __ ]

00:04:02.19 yesterday I I cleaned out and reorganized the shed you know where I

00:04:07.03 put my lawnmower and stuff and I was sweating like a [ __ ] I had to take a

00:04:12.09 shower after because I was pouring sweat I I cut a little bit of the grass

00:04:17.19 yesterday because it's so [ __ ] warm in late December in Texas that my grass

00:04:23.09 is growing again so I had to clean up a little patch

00:04:26.21 and you were snowed the [ __ ] in yeah it was like 28 degrees celsius uh and it

00:04:31.06 was it was like swim weather on Christmas day oh that's terrible like it

00:04:36.11 was snowing on Christmas beautiful it was fantastic it doesn't happen a lot

00:04:40.09 here uh it snowed last night it like topped off everything that was gone I'm

00:04:45.03 like I'm trapped in I'm locked in it's annoying I wanted a mcdonald's breakfast

00:04:49.18 this morning but I felt bad or using a delivery service app on the same day

00:04:53.17 where they canceled all mail deliveries because the conditions it's like I can't

00:04:57.05 I can't it's an early fee right now right it's like 10 in the morning it's

00:05:00.04 10 in the morning yeah recording this earlier than usual so you didn't you you

00:05:05.05 like morally didn't go for it no I felt like it if Dave if the mail isn't being

00:05:09.16 delivered I certainly can't summon a mcdonald's order I feel like that's just

00:05:14.07 wrong I feel bad hmm even though they are volunteering to do that but I don't

00:05:18.21 know it just felt I'd have to what if you go and Steve delivered your food

00:05:24.10 I yeah Steve I'm sure is great bobcat I'm not sure about

00:05:28.23 Steve seems like a great guy speaking of like feeling like a a

00:05:33.10 terrible person during snow did you ever have such a specific category

00:05:39.18 did you have it on like really snowy days like if you're walking to school

00:05:45.18 play a game of guess who might be dead no

00:05:48.00 what if it was like fresh snow you would just look at all the houses that had no

00:05:53.11 footprints leading away oh no it never even occurred to me to do that

00:05:57.17 is that a game people play it was a game I played with my friends

00:06:03.14 you just see like you'd see either no foot footsteps or

00:06:07.18 you'd just see the footsteps of the postman like going

00:06:11.15 in one and then out the other but really like the occupants have never come out

00:06:15.16 so you're like oh they might be dead have you ever considered the moral

00:06:19.01 weight of what if they were dead what if you called what if like do you think

00:06:23.07 there's ever a prediction that came true I feel like that's a really funny game

00:06:27.03 unless you call out someone who's actually dead and then it's terrible

00:06:31.00 yeah unless you win it's a really funny game until it works if you win it's sad

00:06:36.11 it sounds like the beginning of an unsolved mysteries episode it's like

00:06:40.11 then the mailmen noticed his were the only tracks for eight straight days

00:06:45.16 the mail was piling up I feel like that was a thing oh god damn so how was your

00:06:49.19 Christmas Andrew my okay this is my Christmas was I love Christmas um I had

00:06:54.14 three presents under the tree big Christmas guy big Christmas guy all

00:06:58.23 three of them got pissed on by my cat that was my Christmas I had a great time

00:07:03.23 three a hundred nobody there there are a few other presents under the tree no

00:07:08.03 other presents were impacted my cat went three for three just over mine never

00:07:12.09 happened you done to sam recently I haven't done a sing I've been the

00:07:16.06 [ __ ] nicest to sam sam's doing great she's just living her life and she's

00:07:20.17 pissing all over my presents it was great that was my Christmas before we we

00:07:25.00 like go deeper I just wanna I feel like we should shut this out because we

00:07:27.22 didn't I meant to last week and my computer exploded trying to print the law um

00:07:32.02 there's another Christmas album and it's really good people should listen to it

00:07:35.18 it's awesome ave gavino is an absurdly amazing song they did a great job oh

00:07:40.21 and I need to apologize to the the comment leaver twins who asked me to

00:07:46.03 participate and I said yes and then I I got distracted and forgot

00:07:50.05 I feel terrible about that a single you could do a Christmas single in summer I

00:07:53.12 was all about it and then uh then I just

00:07:55.15 uh I got distracted with other [ __ ] yeah and they completely slipped my mind

00:07:59.03 that's fair the problem is I yeah well anyway uh how was your Christmas Kevin

00:08:03.16 um I had a bit of a mare with the presents um I I'm I hate to be like a

00:08:07.10 last-minute Christmas shopper because there's this panic involved you make

00:08:11.22 worse decisions everything's more expensive so yeah in

00:08:16.09 I think it was September I pre-ordered the uh bo Burnham album inside on vinyl

00:08:22.00 because he released the songs just on on

00:08:24.18 final we'd like to have a let's have our favorite stuff you know to play on a

00:08:29.11 record player so I pre-ordered it or at least I thought I did

00:08:32.21 bloody uh 20th of December is coming around and I'm I'm like wait what didn't

00:08:38.00 I and I'm searching through my emails and I'm panicking because I can't find

00:08:41.19 any trace that I actually bought this thing I do this a lot where I'll just

00:08:45.10 like shove something in my cart and I'll

00:08:47.03 just not follow through all the way like I'll get to literally the last button

00:08:50.10 click and then like three days later I'm like I didn't press submit damn it but

00:08:53.23 yeah I guess like three months went by had absolutely no no record of it so I

00:08:59.05 had to it obviously completely sold out everywhere I took to eBay I was like oh

00:09:03.01 my god because I hate I just hate last I

00:09:05.11 hate like paying more for something that

00:09:07.09 clearly isn't worth that and they're all like two three times the price on eBay

00:09:11.01 you gotta pay for shipping and all this stuff so I'm just like oh I'm trying to

00:09:15.18 find one that will be here before Christmas I found one

00:09:19.16 spent you know about three times the price on it and uh thankfully Christmas

00:09:25.07 eve it shows up that's a relief dude did it show up in

00:09:29.20 intact and what you ordered yeah but then I realized the same day I get an

00:09:35.05 email um saying updated delivery date 29th so I was like wait a day

00:09:39.12 wait a second turns out the original one has gone

00:09:43.01 through I just couldn't find it because I guess I use apple pay and I didn't

00:09:48.04 actually have an account or anything so my email just showed up nothing

00:09:52.15 so I got so I have a second one coming the first thing I open on Christmas day

00:09:57.20 from meg to me inside on vinyl oh no we got it for each other and I got

00:10:04.15 two we have three of the damn things now so if you need to if you need some nice

00:10:09.22 songs you guys are the world's biggest bo Burnham fans holy [ __ ]

00:10:16.13 I mean we I do really like bo Burnham I think he's a genius I don't like him

00:10:21.20 three vinyls worth but um but price I've got an excessive now I

00:10:26.21 might take back to eBay no no no hear me

00:10:30.10 out listen I got these things called bts sauces I got a lot of them

00:10:34.20 I give you 274 for one momentum that feels like a fair trade how many s

00:10:39.16 what's the sauce the Burnham ratio I think I think you're

00:10:43.07 I think your sauces are you're cutting yourself short on the sauces I think

00:10:46.13 they're worth more than a Burnham no wow okay well never mind then Devin you're

00:10:52.19 not a Burnham fan Geoff I I'm I'm a Burnham ambivalent I I've

00:10:57.11 I've seen him in interviews before and he seems very

00:11:00.08 uh adept and and he seems lovely and and really interesting I liked that eighth

00:11:04.17 grade movie but I never saw it inside I've seen some of this stand up yeah I

00:11:08.10 like them I don't have a I'm I'm like vaguely pro Burnham I guess

00:11:12.11 inside and make happy I think are very good very good shows that's what I hear

00:11:17.06 that's what I hear everybody everybody seems to agree uh that they are lovely

00:11:21.08 if they're not three vinyl's worth is it two do you think inside is two vinyl's

00:11:25.13 worth would you be fine with two is is the three like at what point or is it

00:11:31.01 anything above one on the Burnham vinyl scale that you were saying

00:11:34.23 is too acceptable like at what point was three like just too far is what I'm

00:11:39.05 trying to figure out uh well how how useful is two I think it's nice to have

00:11:43.08 a spare do you have two record players I don't have two record players well you

00:11:48.08 got a spare you got to back up Burnham is it a is it like a rare colored vinyl

00:11:54.03 or limited edition in any way no there was one I think there was a

00:11:58.10 yellow one but I didn't that was immediately sold out

00:12:02.12 I wonder what you can do there's got to be something clever you can do

00:12:07.17 with these two extra bog standard burnums

00:12:11.00 you got you got two blog burnham's you need to get rid of there's got to be a

00:12:14.18 funny way to do it he's accessible right he's an internet

00:12:19.07 dude maybe we could figure something out with him what's the what some random

00:12:24.21 stranger accidentally yeah yeah why not you've got a following on social media

00:12:29.15 I'm sure you could make some stuff happen get him to autograph him and give

00:12:33.02 him to charity or something I think he did tweet me once

00:12:36.05 what or we could shoot him into space I don't know

00:12:41.07 what's the most confused you've ever been by a gift Christmas gift

00:12:45.17 specifically I I could say I've once confused someone

00:12:50.20 yeah what was that did we disconnect that was [ __ ] crazy it happened I

00:12:55.22 thought you were everything okay no that was straight I thought Gavin was gonna

00:12:59.20 continue I didn't know that that was he took like a pause like we were gonna

00:13:05.01 that was [ __ ] crazy to see if if that was like appropriate

00:13:09.07 for the conversation of course you'd give it like a go ahead

00:13:12.11 [ __ ] continue we're hanging under every word and there aren't a lot of

00:13:16.21 words to hang on right now fill us in this is I kind of feel bad about this

00:13:22.21 now too I I once I once got a Christmas card from my gran

00:13:27.02 um and I realized that I hadn't actually thrown out all of the Christmas cards

00:13:31.17 from the previous year and she'd got me the exact same card that she gave me the

00:13:36.22 year before like I was identical even wrote the same stuff so I just brought

00:13:40.23 out the old one and showed her I was like

00:13:43.18 why'd you send me two and she was like oh and she was trying to

00:13:47.13 figure out how she's made she I didn't tell her that one of them was from the

00:13:51.22 year before because I I wanted that's so mean I know no I wouldn't do

00:13:56.19 it because I feel like she's so much older that it actually messed with her

00:14:00.01 but back then it was like she was young enough for it to be funny monster uh but

00:14:03.17 yeah I feel like yeah I definitely wouldn't do that now but she was just

00:14:06.19 like how did I send two and it was like the same color pen and like the same

00:14:11.22 amount of stamps were on the thing she was like but I did but

00:14:16.16 did you uh did you ever tell her that they were from two separate years or

00:14:20.21 does she still think that she sent you two in the same time frame

00:14:24.16 I'm not sure if I told her

00:14:26.21 but you know she was in her 60s at the time that's fine that's not the sort of

00:14:31.16 senile age that's just funny this is a funny joke

00:14:35.04 an unsolved mystery it's haunted her I feel like I have time I feel like if I

00:14:38.23 told her now be more traumatic because she'd be trying to remember

00:14:44.23 you remind it just for her to remember to then ruin the thing I remember

00:14:50.10 um I got one year so I don't know it's probably like eight or nine I was given

00:14:55.11 monty python in the holy grail on dvd I know a concept of it was like my

00:15:00.00 introduction to monty python I didn't know anything about it and I [ __ ]

00:15:04.23 loved it I thought it was so funny and then the following year I was giving

00:15:10.02 breakfast at tiffany's on dvd and.

00:15:13.14 I was like really breakfast okay well you know Santa really nailed the pick

00:15:19.03 with the monty python and the holy grail so I guess you know he seems to know my

00:15:23.11 preferences he seems to know my taste I'll watch I watch I thought it was so

00:15:27.04 boring and I was like why did I get this

00:15:30.05 it was from Santa both years I was still in like full-on Santa as like Santa

00:15:34.23 [ __ ] nailed monty python I don't know what he was thinking with this

00:15:38.06 with this breakfast at tiffany's pick what had happened is somehow my mom

00:15:42.18 bought the wrong movie and then didn't notice in the wrapping process that it

00:15:46.12 was the wrong movie she was equally surprised when I opened breakfast at

00:15:49.22 tiffany's it's just a complete accidental gift was she going for

00:15:53.09 another python and got the wrong one I don't know it was a year later I I don't

00:15:57.09 know I don't understand how she was able

00:16:00.15 to fully wrap it without like having the thought of why is this a gift

00:16:05.22 for me she was going for life of Brian maybe

00:16:08.22 it's got a name in the title how uh how old were you I think I was like

00:16:13.15 eight to nine or nine to ten yeah breakfast at tiffany's is a was a great

00:16:18.16 movie for but might be lost on an eight-year-old yeah I didn't I didn't

00:16:23.07 also have some pretty problematic [ __ ] in it too

00:16:27.07 unfortunately breakfast Tiffany back yeah yeah the whole mickey Rooney plays

00:16:33.01 an Asian man's stuff it's pretty pretty rough

00:16:36.12 that's not good yeah that's unfortunate what about you Geoff how was your

00:16:40.15 Christmas uh I think it was good um I'm trying to

00:16:45.01 remember I'm I've uh have been sleeping a lot lately and so my brain's a little

00:16:50.05 Swiss cheese right now uh I uh I had a similar kind of fuck-up I mean

00:16:54.18 it wasn't as hilarious as gavin's or anything but I did get frustrated with a

00:16:59.16 certain uh company that you buy kitchen [ __ ] from

00:17:02.23 where I bought a I'm not gonna call them out uh psylliums monoma but uh

00:17:08.08 I bought Emily one of her one of her like her second nicest gift was this

00:17:14.04 giant really nice picnic basket that uh has like everything you could need in it

00:17:18.10 like you know all the different silverwares

00:17:20.21 and like even salt and pepper shakers and it's all like really pretty and nice

00:17:24.08 I thought it'd be a fun gift that we could maybe start going on picnics and

00:17:27.21 stuff and uh I [ __ ] I shopped around this was in November I bought this thing

00:17:32.13 I was trying to be ahead of it too I shopped around a bunch of places a lot

00:17:36.15 of places didn't have any in stock I finally found one at an unnamed

00:17:41.18 kitchen supply store that I'm no longer a fan of

00:17:44.00 and uh they had one in stock so I said okay I spent a ton of money on it I

00:17:47.19 bought it and it said like it checks like the item isn't shop so I bought it

00:17:53.05 and then I thought oh I wonder when it's gonna ship since it's in stock and

00:17:58.13 uh when I went back in with the order number to look it updated the shipping

00:18:03.14 date from in stock to march of next year maybe

00:18:06.19 and then it wouldn't let me cancel the order

00:18:09.21 and so it held it's held me hostage so I had to buy Emily a fisher price uh

00:18:15.01 picnic basket like for small children and wrap that and say like soda I'll

00:18:19.21 replace this with a real one yeah there's a placeholder I'll replace this

00:18:23.11 with a real one in four months maybe well hey it's [ __ ] annoying next time

00:18:27.09 you need a basket Geoff I got you you just let me know give me a week's notice

00:18:32.04 I got you covered I don't know why that company like flilliam's blanoma and uh

00:18:37.09 yeah noma yeah they they just sell stuff that

00:18:40.19 doesn't exist they sell I just say I've stopped yeah don't don't let me order

00:18:45.00 something in November give it to me in may like that you don't have it

00:18:49.20 yeah I got something that's arriving five months from now god damn dude I one

00:18:54.04 time I this is this I didn't buy this this is not kitchen gear but when I was

00:18:57.13 living in the condo downtown I was having to buy new furniture and stuff uh

00:19:02.04 when I was like striking back out on my own again and uh

00:19:06.07 I had to buy some uh uh nightstands and so I I don't want to call out any

00:19:10.21 particular company again so I'm going to call this uh I'm going to call this

00:19:16.06 company mest melm or let's call it estwelm now let's call

00:19:20.05 it estwelm yeah uh and uh so I bought two uh nightstands from them and I was

00:19:25.10 excited about them because they had charging stations built in where you

00:19:29.13 could just you know the like the the ones you just lay your iPhone on and

00:19:33.03 it charges which I have now I bought a third party like I have like an external

00:19:37.06 one but these came just installed and there were usb ports built into the back

00:19:41.23 of it as well and I thought this is the [ __ ] future right this is everybody's

00:19:45.15 gonna have this so I was like [ __ ] yeah in stock no problem bottom

00:19:49.12 after about a week I got an update that they uh that the shipping was delayed

00:19:52.23 gonna be delayed a month then uh right around the time it was

00:19:57.11 supposed to show up I got a delay uh another month and then it was delayed

00:20:03.16 three months after a year and a half I cancelled the order at some point

00:20:08.12 at some point I was like Emily was like you gotta

00:20:11.18 cancel this and I was like I kinda wanna see I just kind of wanna see how how

00:20:16.23 long it goes and I had after about two months I went and bought normal

00:20:20.05 nightstands which I still have I was like [ __ ] it I'm never gonna see these

00:20:23.04 this is gonna take forever uh and then I thought well you know and if

00:20:26.11 they come in and they're really cool maybe I can sell the other ones uh on

00:20:30.12 I don't know to friends or whatever and because I still really want these

00:20:33.19 new technological ones and then after a year and a half I finally just canceled

00:20:37.02 it because I wanted my money back but I'm reasonably certain that they never

00:20:41.08 existed they just they put a picture up on the swelm website and said here buy

00:20:46.09 this and then they thought like maybe it's like a pre-order situation like

00:20:49.08 maybe if enough people buy it we'll actually go into production and make

00:20:52.21 them and they just never did and so for literally 18 months every month I would

00:20:57.14 get an update that my shipping has been delayed a month I called them a bunch

00:21:01.00 and they'd be like oh yeah they always had an excuse like it's gonna I promise

00:21:04.10 you I probably called him four times over the year and a half and then

00:21:07.07 eventually I just called him and I was like just cancel this and they were like

00:21:08.17 are you sure and I'm like yeah I'm sure and they tried to convince me and I was

00:21:12.12 like look back through it's been a year and a half you're not giving them to me

00:21:15.18 and they're like I see I see yes it's it appears that we're not uh appears that

00:21:19.00 we are full of [ __ ] uh we'll go ahead and cancel out for you right now I've

00:21:22.06 got one of those that I'm just letting go it's just seeing how long it takes I

00:21:26.19 bought this I think was for I've been for valentine's or her birthday like 20

00:21:32.04 beginning of 2020 I think I bought this and every

00:21:34.19 every quarter I get an update email on uh when this thing's getting delivered

00:21:40.13 it's like a left it's like a dead by daylight statue mm-hmm

00:21:45.03 uh so according to this screens hot currently expected to

00:21:49.01 arrive June 2022 to august 2022.

00:21:59.11 and they've already charged me and no refunds I can't even say don't bother

00:22:04.19 it's just not an option yeah that's uh that's what I'm going

00:22:08.10 through with a certain picnic basket right now [ __ ] dude I wonder who

00:22:12.09 will get it first I wonder if I'll get the picnic Emily I'll get her pick me

00:22:15.18 basket or you'll get your dead by daylight statue first I I predict uh

00:22:19.22 face will have ended by the time I get the statue it'll be over oh that's

00:22:24.13 that's sad I feel like that's too f like you are

00:22:27.17 that's enough time that you are no longer the same person when you ordered

00:22:32.02 that like you have changed as a human being by the time you get that statue

00:22:40.08 generation by the time I get it it'll be like

00:22:43.10 it'll be like my mum got it for me there might be a second or third

00:22:48.10 iteration of the game before it comes out

00:22:52.19 like dead by daylight three or four might be out by the time you get this

00:22:57.09 [ __ ] thing.

00:27:30.18 amusing okay as you know we have we have the bits email that

00:27:35.06 people can email in on and recently I got an email on it

00:27:39.22 for a I'm not going to say the company or what they sell well I guess I'll I'll

00:27:45.16 give the the type of what it is I got an email on it for wanting to do a

00:27:49.07 sponsorship with our show they're a sex toy company and they want to promote

00:27:54.15 a very specific product that is a [ __ I device and I was like

00:27:59.05 this is such a [ __ ] why would you reach out to this email

00:28:04.15 this is so odd I realized that it we have

00:28:06.20 we have faced ourselves in the sense of they think this is a face [ __ ]

00:28:11.05 podcast oh yeah face [ __ ] yeah like they I don't

00:28:15.07 think they know anything about the show outside of the name face which they've

00:28:20.21 interpreted very literally as like this is the place to sell the [ __ ] device

00:28:26.04 I wonder what other [ __ ] we could do with a [ __ ] device that's not

00:28:31.00 sectional uh stick a bit of velcro on it.

00:28:36.08 I wanted to just write back and say sorry we're an apple podcast but I

00:28:40.19 wanted to discuss this I just thought it was so funny what

00:28:44.11 is it you suck it off for it sucks you off how does it work it's it sucks you

00:28:48.17 off yeah you suck it off yeah so you can practice getting [ __ ]

00:28:53.20 what do you mean why is that so weird.

00:29:02.06 [Music]

00:29:08.15 What are you talking about what's so weird about it

00:29:12.08 are you sucking on a lot of dildos in your personal life not no judgment

00:29:17.11 here I'm just curious no I've never done it do you do a lot of [ __ ] practicing

00:29:22.18 no I love it not [Laughter]

00:29:37.16 this is a tool this is a tool that's weird I think maybe just

00:29:42.19 I think you would have said dildo is what's weird about it

00:29:46.19 if I think like my suggestion is weird because you would have just said

00:29:49.21 you said [ __ ] device and that's why I'm off base.

00:29:56.19 I just love the idea of gathering a home

00:29:59.22 going I don't know how good I am at this well let's see

00:30:02.15 I got a 75 I wonder if I could beat my score tomorrow

00:30:05.10 I mean if there's some one of those machines you punch in the arcade the

00:30:09.22 numbers go up if it's something that you'd like put

00:30:14.10 your knob in does it really matter it could be any hole couldn't it sleep

00:30:19.23 its mouth oh it could be any hole oh Gavin what a

00:30:25.01 weird road you took this out I've never used one do they make specific

00:30:32.00 do they make one with like like teeth and tongue and stuff I don't know

00:30:37.16 I didn't expect all these questions have you seen the device

00:30:42.13 I don't think they included it if they if it has teeth and tongues and

00:30:48.04 stuff I have an idea here's a you could use it you could use it you could use it

00:30:53.12 if you have like sore teeth like maybe you just got a cavity or maybe you're

00:30:57.00 you've you're just you know uh you've got weak teeth you could use

00:31:00.17 it to pre-chew your food for you you stick like a piece of steak in there

00:31:05.01 and then just smash the end together until it chews up the food and then you

00:31:08.15 just drop it in your mouth like a baby bird

00:31:11.04 that's got a blender why would you want why don't you want to match it up in a

00:31:14.23 fake then you'd have to brush his teeth after I got a news for you buddy you're

00:31:20.15 brushing its teeth after no matter how you use it this is

00:31:26.00 apparently what it looks like oh wow wow that's really

00:31:29.13 a detail it looks like a brittle water filter with a mouth on top

00:31:34.06 I have one of those in my fridge it's a soda stream yeah that looks

00:31:38.23 oh my god oh why is that oh wow they've gone to all the effort to make like the

00:31:44.17 chin and the nose and then there's like a bit of blue plastic below it like at

00:31:50.04 least give it a neck with giant screws the blue neck with the giant screws

00:31:55.00 really ruins the mouth illusion oh it's even got it's even got little nose

00:32:00.13 I'm sure my toothbrush would fit in there

00:32:05.14 well I imagine it's designed for things to fit in there so

00:32:11.07 yeah as Eric said I think a lot can fit in there and he's probably right what a

00:32:16.19 weird what a weird direction you've taken the

00:32:20.06 podcast in season four Gavin I didn't bring it here Andrew brought in this

00:32:25.03 mouth I didn't I didn't expect for you to go the way you did the questions you

00:32:30.19 asked you could give me a million questions I never asked what's the

00:32:37.05 purpose of the device who's it for oh man oh

00:32:40.21 oh god that was fun holy [ __ ] you're like

00:32:44.04 you're worried never mind I can't would you kiss it before or after.

00:32:53.05 I was thinking recently of um you know how you you two uh what was that thing

00:32:58.13 you were doing last week or the week before where you were basically just

00:33:01.23 kidding yourselves oh it was like the uh by having having two socks and having a

00:33:06.09 spare because it's like a spare instead of just buying that caused a lot of

00:33:11.20 inspired conversation oh really what was what was the

00:33:14.13 situation well a lot of people agree with you Gavin that Andrew and I are way

00:33:19.03 off base and stupid I think that I think that what people are missing and where

00:33:23.19 my line of reasoning is is obviously first off these are unisex socks right

00:33:27.17 they're not left or right socks these are just tube socks normal socks that

00:33:31.20 don't have an I or an r on them uh obviously uh but I think that the problem is

00:33:37.00 the way that I was approaching it that maybe I didn't articulate clearly is if

00:33:41.09 you buy three socks and you lose a sock you have a pair of socks still

00:33:46.04 if you buy four socks yeah what how do you're

00:33:49.14 saying the exact same thing how are you articulating it different that's like

00:33:55.07 this is insane no because it no because people are like because people are like

00:33:58.08 no because you you'd still have two pairs of socks but the second you lose a

00:34:01.10 sock you don't have two pairs of socks so why I don't know I think it's

00:34:05.00 brilliant I think three socks can I can I clarify can I attempt to clarify this

00:34:09.22 idea of the other person that is on board with this thing first of all

00:34:13.13 it's cost the same amount as a singular pair of socks so it's like you're

00:34:16.14 getting one yeah we're going in with a value it's a bonus sock because it's the

00:34:20.18 same price as two that's where the bonus comes in but the other part is money

00:34:24.12 selling it you don't know the [ __ ]

00:34:26.14 what a weird once again what are you none of this is real what do you mean

00:34:29.16 I'm gonna lose money selling it you don't know my factory setup you don't

00:34:34.21 know the deals I've made maybe it's not all about the

00:34:37.08 the bottom line you capitalist pig maybe it's about providing the best product

00:34:41.13 for the customer

00:34:44.04 my biggest issue with it is that your main problem with owning two pairs

00:34:50.04 of socks is that if you lose one you end up with three

00:34:54.04 that to you is the problem and you're starting your solution with that you're

00:34:59.05 saying buy the problem did Geoff leaf no I'm listening oh I'm listening let me

00:35:06.17 let me do another counter point to do this whole thing as well it is a

00:35:12.04 spiritual argument I feel we are making as the three sock people

00:35:16.12 on an intellectual level you are completely correct it's a ridiculous

00:35:20.14 claim that we're making but it's once again it's like coke tastes better in

00:35:24.08 the snow there's just a personal security with the third sock right

00:35:29.03 right yeah so it's not it's not you're trying to win a logical debate

00:35:34.00 oh Eric Eric's freaking out Eric missed that last week I guess were you not

00:35:38.21 there for that Eric no I think I I think I missed that one

00:35:43.03 about coke tastes better in the snow I don't remember that

00:35:46.04 that really I'm like listening intently and then you said that and it's like

00:35:50.14 that I got sideswiped I don't know that I remember that either but I don't

00:35:55.18 disagree with it yeah I was saying that if it's snowing outside

00:35:58.23 coca-cola is my beverage of choice one it's snowing there's something about the

00:36:02.21 atmosphere of snow coming down it heightens the experience of drinking a

00:36:06.18 coke which Gavin thought was ridiculous strongly disagreed with it's ridiculous

00:36:10.10 and then I was equating all of your your stu you're just you're just kidding

00:36:13.18 yourself to make your yourself feel good and I was saying how that was like the

00:36:17.17 people who set their clocks fast to make them think that they're not late

00:36:22.10 and all that stuff and I've realized that I have one scenario where I do kid

00:36:26.00 myself yeah yeah what's that sometimes well I think I spoke to you about this

00:36:30.21 on uh when I'm playing halo Andrew but sometimes if I'm

00:36:33.16 making coffee like I'll pour the milk in first because if I pour the coffee on

00:36:37.22 the milk I don't have to stir it it saves me wasting a spoon right but

00:36:41.12 sometimes I put in too much milk or I I might not have enough coffee left in the

00:36:46.07 pot so in order to try and make it seem like I've got more coffee I just pour it

00:36:51.04 slower and I realized I'm like I'm stretching out the pore because it adds

00:36:55.15 more hope to like I might actually have more coffee if I don't just quickly pour

00:36:59.22 it into the milk because I don't want really milky coffee I want I want it to

00:37:03.06 be the right ratio and I realized I'm just kidding myself I could just

00:37:06.03 completely turn it upside down and just dump the whole lot into the milk and

00:37:10.10 it'd be the same amount but that is one area where I'm just

00:37:13.13 I'm just lying to my brain by just pouring it really slowly hoping that

00:37:17.15 there's a little bit more in there doing it that way

00:37:20.15 but that's slow and heightens the experience it's not just lights

00:37:25.09 it gives me hope yeah that's see you know you get it it's

00:37:29.03 not just about the destination it's also

00:37:31.12 about the journey it's about how you get

00:37:33.09 there do you have any of those like kind of strange quirks Geoff or like you do

00:37:38.04 I mean that does nothing but no well I I sticking with the drinks and

00:37:42.15 obviously I I don't uh drink beer anymore because of

00:37:46.08 the crippling alcoholism but I will go to my grave saying that nothing tastes

00:37:52.13 better than an ice cold beer after doing yard work on a hot summer day like beer

00:37:58.04 definitely tastes better after after you've done an hour of cutting grass

00:38:03.14 it's like the best coolest most refreshing flavor ever yeah the best

00:38:09.01 beer or three hours of cleaning out a fridge that broke [Laughter]

00:38:14.23 speaking of breaking did I tell you guys I rode my bike again for the first time

00:38:20.15 in six months five weeks how did your butt hold up how did that go

00:38:23.15 well I didn't I wasn't on the bike long enough to find out oh my gosh

00:38:29.03 got about three miles from home and it died so uh

00:38:34.00 my butt was fine for those three miles there and back

00:38:37.11 but uh yeah I'm I'm about ready to sh I'm about ready to shoot my bikes into

00:38:42.17 space what happened this time just the battery

00:38:46.09 go again yeah it's the I think it's so what I think is happening if I had to

00:38:49.20 guess right this is a refurbed battery I have two refurb batteries I'm not sure

00:38:53.11 if both are having this problem or just one but I'm so mad at all of it that I

00:38:57.20 just I had to walk away for a while but when I come back to it I'm gonna mark

00:39:02.05 this battery in a way and then do conduct these tests on the other battery

00:39:05.10 and see if I just have a bad replacement battery however what I suspect is

00:39:09.09 happening with these shitty cheap batteries is that you know the the thing

00:39:13.12 with a full charge is supposed to go about 30 miles

00:39:17.09 I suspect that I plugged it in after going like 15 miles and it's just like

00:39:22.17 the next time I wrote it I could only go 15 miles right

00:39:26.20 and so I think that every time I plug it in uh

00:39:29.20 it just it can only charge up to the amount that I used it because I came home

00:39:34.11 after I walked you know after I [ __ ]

00:39:36.12 labored to get it home and I plugged it in really fast and it turned on

00:39:40.07 immediately and still had like eighty percent of the battery so I think

00:39:43.17 it just like turns off or whatever when it hits that that point when it last

00:39:47.22 charged and it just needs to be uh plugged in again for one second to like

00:39:52.13 re wake it back up again so I'm even wondering if maybe I could have a bunch

00:39:56.04 of the extra cords if I could even like cut the end off of the plug and just

00:40:00.04 bring it with me and whenever the battery turns off if I just shove it in

00:40:03.09 if that's enough or if I have to bring like a whole charger with me and then

00:40:06.12 just like stop somewhere and plug it in for one second and then the bike's like

00:40:10.04 oh wait no I'm sorry I'm [ __ ] I turned off like an idiot I'm totally

00:40:13.03 fine you still have 85 percent of your battery here my bad and then I can keep

00:40:16.08 going I suspect that's gonna be the case but uh

00:40:19.11 if I go near that bicycle any time soon I'm gonna throw it in a [ __ ] river so

00:40:23.08 if you just unplug the battery though and plug it back in what happens then

00:40:26.14 that doesn't that that doesn't that doesn't do anything I have to literally

00:40:30.17 plug it into power or put something in that thing for it to trigger hmm that

00:40:34.11 sucks yeah and all of your bikes are broken you have like three of them right

00:40:39.14 uh well I have three bikes two batteries now and uh

00:40:43.21 millie's bike is broken so I have the emily's bike in mine and two batteries

00:40:48.00 among them but you know I wasn't able to

00:40:50.17 ride the bike for five weeks any of them and so this was my first attempt back

00:40:54.21 and uh it went dismal and so I I don't know man maybe

00:40:57.20 I'm done with bikes and I need to find a

00:41:00.00 new a new coping mechanism I will say if if we're talking just trying to put a

00:41:03.21 positive spin on it it's good the bike broke and not you that was the previous

00:41:07.17 issue right was that you couldn't ride the bike now the bike cannot be written

00:41:12.13 I'd say that's an upgrade yeah that's true my my butt feels

00:41:16.09 fine you know it's christman I don't have the pains that I've had so that I

00:41:21.11 take that as a positive uh no Eric wrote so what you had a

00:41:24.14 normal bike I wish I wish these things turned into normal bikes when when the

00:41:28.19 electricity goes off they don't they turn into

00:41:31.00 slightly movable objects it's like an anvil with wheels it's like an anvil

00:41:35.01 with wheels yes what if you go in that had a mechanism that you could just like

00:41:38.20 disengage when it's dead so it is a bike do they exist

00:41:42.21 you know like the scene in the dark night where the Batmobile dies and it

00:41:47.10 turns into like a Batmobile motorbike like he shoots out I love the idea of a

00:41:51.18 bike turning into a bike like the bike breaks so you then just

00:41:55.07 turned into a functional bike the problem is I mean it still functions as

00:41:58.19 a bike it's just a very heavy bike because these batteries are [ __ ]

00:42:02.15 heavy you know you take the battery off and uh then it's uh it's still not a

00:42:07.06 great bike but it functions more as one does that totally break the Batmobile

00:42:11.02 when that happens or did that is it did it just happen that way in the movie

00:42:14.03 like can he just bike out of the Batmobile and then and then just drive

00:42:17.09 it like rear it back in does he like back it back into the battery remember

00:42:21.14 yeah and also like could both sides do that like what if you're in the

00:42:24.19 passenger seat when that happens is it only one side is a bike what does

00:42:29.03 the other side do because I think in the movie he gets the bike out after the

00:42:34.12 main car is broken yes he does and it looks like it destroys itself it is

00:42:37.23 funny to think that like that [ __ ]

00:42:40.05 always seems to work for him like Lucius was very good at his job I guess but

00:42:44.19 like it would be funny to see batman after like solving the crime trying to

00:42:48.03 put the bike back into the [ __ I car it's like stuck in one thing and he's

00:42:52.10 like he's like trying to [ __ ] force it he's like this piece of [ __ ] yeah I

00:42:55.17 would like to think that that happened I would like to think that batman has

00:42:59.20 frustrations that we just don't see yeah the everyday issues you know when you

00:43:03.07 see in movies there's like a broadcast from space or some evil villain is able

00:43:07.05 to take over every tv in in the world and broadcast a message that to me is

00:43:12.23 the most unrealistic based on the the difficulty I have like casting something

00:43:17.07 from my own phone to my own tv on my own wi-fi network

00:43:21.06 that to me is the most unrealistic thing in movie history that they could just

00:43:28.00 take over tvs yeah if they could I would pay them extra money to make hulu work

00:43:31.16 in my bedroom every time

00:43:34.06 god damn that's what we need to do is we need to hire supervillains to fix our

00:43:37.17 tech products I was about to say it'll be like a catch we can thing they get

00:43:41.12 hired at the end we need you to show us the way

00:43:44.05 I know you're trying to poison the water reservoir but we really need streaming

00:43:48.10 to work we're willing to cut you a deal can you cast this for us

00:43:53.09 technology is unbelievable I was broken in a different way Geoff last few days

00:43:59.12 oh my bed my bed has been [ __ ] my bed has been destroyed

00:44:02.10 I uh I had a box spring that was wooden sl have you have has anyone here ever

00:44:06.10 had a box spring that was like wooden slats yeah you would lay on top yeah

00:44:09.15 they're the first I bought one right now worst they're the they're the worst at

00:44:13.07 least in my experience with them maybe I have a shitty one it [ __ ] sucks it's

00:44:17.21 constantly falling down a hole I'll be laying in bed and all of a sudden I'm in

00:44:21.18 a hole and it's like I'm deep enough in a hole you know like in a movie where a

00:44:25.16 villain lands on top of a car and like how it indents it's like that's how much

00:44:30.12 of a hole I'm in I'm in like a [ __ ]

00:44:33.09 car movie hole it stinks and it's just been that way and I I hurt

00:44:37.14 I hurt my foot shockingly so I'm hobbling around and every [ __ ] night

00:44:42.10 I'm falling in a hole and I can't sleep because I'm in this [ __ ] car hole and

00:44:47.02 it sucks so is it the slat has come loose or it's snapped or what like how

00:44:51.03 are you going down a hole so some of the beams are broken as well as it just

00:44:55.10 slides it'll just slide off and fall down then I'm in a [ __ ] hole and it

00:45:00.12 stinks but your head is still on eight pillows

00:45:03.11 my head is still on eight pillows my legs are propped up my midsection is in

00:45:09.05 a [ __ ] hole it's the worst I can't sleep like a bee you do I do

00:45:16.06 that's exactly right I would try sleep is a strong word too it's really tough

00:45:21.02 to sleep and it'll be like 3 a.m I'll make a slight movement it's like the

00:45:24.19 scene in Jurassic world too you know with the glass where they can't move

00:45:27.20 because it's denting like that's me in my bed and then I inevitably fall in the

00:45:32.23 [ __ ] hall no matter what I do I'm just imagining the camera angle below

00:45:36.23 your bed and your face is pressed

00:45:39.18 so so this has been an issue for a while

00:45:42.13 and I eventually I I just said you know what enough is a [ __ ] I can't take

00:45:47.21 this anymore I'm just gonna my original plan was to flip because the slats are

00:45:52.03 on two sides the bottom bed slats and the top bed slats bottom bed slats

00:45:57.07 kind of fine it's like you roll them out like there's

00:45:59.22 two sections of wood that you roll out for the slack part of it

00:46:04.08 mine's in two halves which which makes it

00:46:07.23 I think another issue where it separates the half meat right in the middle so

00:46:12.10 like yeah it's a constant I'm [ __ ]

00:46:14.12 falling in holes all the time I'm just trying to sleep I've had hot hops where

00:46:18.02 it's left and right no this is this is top down are you sure you don't sleep

00:46:23.05 sideways I don't okay well we're gonna we're gonna get to that anyway oh no

00:46:29.14 we I de-assembled the bed because I'm gonna flip them and I'd realize how

00:46:34.04 [ __ ] broken this this thing is more broken than I real there's all the wood

00:46:39.01 is cracked everything's [ __ ]

00:46:39.01 destroyed I've had this for a long time at this point so I was like I'm just

00:46:43.01 going to get rid of it I'm going to throw it all away but I need a box

00:46:46.13 spring and I have a king-sized bed which is I don't know five years ago I was

00:46:50.05 like you know what I'm gonna really treat myself I typically don't buy

00:46:53.11 things for me I'm gonna use my bed a lot I'm gonna go all out I'm getting a

00:46:57.03 [ __ ] king but it's the um it's the only king size I have I have one other

00:47:00.19 queen and a spare room no wonder it takes up your entire room king-sized bed

00:47:05.03 for one person it's [ __ ] it's great it's a fantastic

00:47:08.17 I would highly recommend it so I brought in this queen-size box ring but I have

00:47:14.17 this other problem now where it doesn't fit on the box ring

00:47:18.05 and so I'm having to sleep very carefully I'm so every time I go to bed

00:47:22.04 now I'm in the middle and I'm so nervous

00:47:23.22 I'm gonna roll if I roll a little bit to the left or right I'm [ __ ] just

00:47:28.02 flying out of this bag oh so that's width ways

00:47:31.06 that's not the end of the bed that's the side of the bed

00:47:35.18 that's the side of the bed which has led to me realizing I've had my bed on

00:47:41.01 sideways this entire time and I would highly recommend anyone with a

00:47:46.12 king-sized bed because it's large enough

00:47:49.09 where you can have it on its side I have more width than I do length I'm like

00:47:54.02 five foot ten it works great I feel like I it's genuinely like half

00:47:58.07 my bed is in a different state when I lay in it you have so much space

00:48:02.13 I would highly recommend it so because of this I've learned that I've been

00:48:06.08 sleeping on my bed sideways but now with

00:48:08.06 what you guys have brought up maybe I've had the slats on the wrong way the

00:48:11.11 entire time too maybe like that has been twisted I don't know if that's true I

00:48:16.05 need I'm gonna look at the company that I bought this from and see if they've

00:48:21.11 got it install no it doesn't look like that Eric just posted uh this it's the

00:48:25.12 top one the top slats it's the way I guess in my head but it's not it's not

00:48:29.09 those kind top slots so it goes top top down I'll

00:48:33.00 just post a link to the thing that I use

00:48:35.13 but yeah I've been my my life hack is if you have a king bed which I know is a

00:48:39.12 luxury flip it on its side sleep the other way it is a great experience you

00:48:44.10 have so much extra space but that's why I've been broken

00:48:48.12 so falling in holes Geoff you you uh I just feel like you'd want more

00:48:53.16 length though and are you a do you travel length is overrated

00:48:58.05 length is so overrated length is couldn't I'm never gonna grow taller in

00:49:02.12 bed yeah but sometimes I might roll you ever like sort of you're on your back in

00:49:06.05 bed and then sometimes you want to like push you want to turn over on your front

00:49:09.14 and like push on the headboard so you slide down a little bit and you're just

00:49:12.19 sort of in the bottom of your pillow and then you you appreciate that your legs

00:49:16.11 don't dangle off the end of the mattress I've never had my legs dangle first of

00:49:20.21 all second of all I've never pushed down on the pillow the only time I've had my

00:49:24.17 legs dangle is when I [ __ I up and like laid in the middle of the bed

00:49:28.13 but at appropriate pillow height I'd say within pillow regulation of where they

00:49:34.07 should be I've never dangled [Laughter]

00:49:37.15 yeah I guess you are halfway up a pillow mounted that'll bring your feet in

00:49:41.18 no I okay so I'm looking at the thing I did it correctly

00:49:45.20 it's not I'm not crazy it's just it's a shitty design yeah I don't like those

00:49:49.13 slats uh beds because it you can't stand on the bed really if you need to no and

00:49:55.11 you just hear it cracking it's terrible it's a terrible

00:49:58.11 stand on a lot of beds uh I mean you're changing your life Devon strikes me as a

00:50:02.23 guy who loves to jump on the bed no I'm not I'm not very I just you know

00:50:07.02 sometimes the standing on the bed is useful for like changing a light

00:50:11.19 that's pretty much it [Laughter]

00:50:17.03 uh yeah I have uh was the last thing we recorded the

00:50:21.20 tuxedo or was it the podcast there was a podcast we did one we did a podcast

00:50:26.17 after the tuxedo okay we did it was a back-to-back one is that that's the one

00:50:30.23 where you uh you had your tech problems yes I don't I couldn't tell you what was

00:50:35.08 happening in that episode but we did record the the most broken episode of

00:50:39.11 the show because of the law did the law ever come out the law has come out I've

00:50:43.22 been working on it I've been I'm looking

00:50:46.02 I've been trying to figure out loopholes for us for this get out of jail free

00:50:49.06 scenario I like I I tweeted I just wanted to print the law and somebody

00:50:53.08 immediately replied and the law won and I was like you have no idea how accurate

00:50:57.01 that is you couldn't have summarized it perfectly

00:51:01.03 so what are you guys gonna do for new year's because we're recording this on

00:51:04.19 December 30th I'm gonna be snowed in that's what I'm gonna be most likely

00:51:08.08 wishing I could order mcdonald's but can't waiting for for Steve and the

00:51:13.07 bobcat to ride by well maybe it's maybe it's time that you learn how to make

00:51:16.17 your favorite mcdonald's item at home there is I mean if we want to talk fast

00:51:21.04 food controversy there's a big controversy in Canada right now with tim

00:51:25.14 hortons because they've released a new menu item in Mexico and people are like

00:51:29.19 [ __ ] I want it's Canadian I think it's owned by burger king it's not even

00:51:34.00 a Canadian chain anymore but people people were outraged by it the new item

00:51:38.04 was salt as like a sausage and an egg patty or whatever sausage patty and is

00:51:43.12 it an egg patty what do you call the like the mcmuffin egg is that a patty

00:51:47.18 fried egg fried egg between two egg waffles is the whole thing like the eggo

00:51:52.12 is the bread is their idea and people are [ __ ] outraged about this I don't

00:51:56.07 understand why anyone's mad and eggo isn't a [ __ ] inaccessible item you

00:52:00.20 can buy them anywhere you can it's the most easily creatable fast food item in

00:52:05.04 your home you could ever have just buy a box of eggos and buy one of

00:52:09.22 their sausage mcmuffins and you have everything yeah but isn't a regular

00:52:13.02 mcmuffin easy to make too I guess but I feel like you could maybe have some

00:52:17.15 variants in the meat or the egg like the eggo is just an egg there's nothing

00:52:21.23 special about that egg oh so they're just getting they're not making eggos

00:52:26.13 they're just getting shipments no they're just using egg out eggos

00:52:31.16 I don't understand it it's a very weird food controversy that is happening it

00:52:35.08 looks good though it looks fine but it's

00:52:37.08 just I don't understand where people are like why can't we have this [ __ ] go

00:52:40.19 buy some eggs you can create this three minutes

00:52:44.07 so easy well you could do the same thing

00:52:46.12 with an egg mcmuffin you just need to go buy English muffins a sausage patty and

00:52:50.03 a slice of cheese and an egg an English muffin is just as easy to come by as ego

00:52:54.18 waffles no it's it's a different because it's not a mcdonald's egg it's not the

00:52:58.19 mcdonald's cheese like all those things you don't

00:53:02.10 you don't know what it's probably superior in every way than those ingredients

00:53:06.23 you can't come come on mcdonald's has the best coke so they might have the

00:53:10.04 best eggs I can't rule that out I don't know what their eggplant is

00:53:13.18 I'm just saying that there are unique specific items that you can get only

00:53:17.12 there a mcdonald's egg tastes different than a burger king egg or I'm assuming

00:53:22.12 wendy's has eggs in their breakfast menu because I know that I don't we don't

00:53:26.03 have breakfast menu in Canada for wendy's today um they really have the

00:53:30.04 best coke yeah they do they like pay a premium to have the best coke they like

00:53:34.21 get it specially delivered and store it in a unique way and that's also why

00:53:39.00 their straws are larger than any other fast food chain straws they made like an

00:53:42.21 investment a few years ago and like we will have the definitive best coke

00:53:46.15 experience of any fast food chain what does that have to do with the straws

00:53:51.12 it's not a thicker coat well I guess because it's a larger straw it hits more

00:53:56.13 taste buds per sip is the idea it's like part of the drinking

00:54:00.09 experience there's a whole coke thing so I don't know maybe their eggs are as

00:54:04.12 involved too you wouldn't think that a chain would specify something like coke

00:54:08.19 but it's just annoying it's frustrating have you this is gonna seem like a

00:54:13.11 random question Geoff do you storm out of rooms in arguments

00:54:16.18 yeah I've done it on this podcast you've stormed I guess you have haven't you I

00:54:20.11 realized that I'm not a stormer I can't I was trying to think of a time I've

00:54:24.06 done it on camera I was trying to think of a time in which I've stormed out in

00:54:27.20 an argument with anyone yeah this is the conversation that we had during halo

00:54:31.07 when we were talking about I think I was talking about like what it

00:54:34.12 must have been like to storm normandy and stuff and you were just like I don't

00:54:37.20 think I've ever stormed anywhere yeah I've never I don't think I've

00:54:40.13 stormed in my life in any context you said that you'd like slammed a door open

00:54:44.20 or closed but you'd never made the transition across the different rooms

00:54:49.11 and we decided that storming you had to move between rooms at a minimum

00:54:53.14 why do you think people storm out of a room I think well okay so I have a

00:54:57.13 theory on this and maybe it's just I'm applying it to my my personal life and

00:55:01.10 this has made me realize something I don't like about myself Geoff oh cause I

00:55:05.10 feel like the storm occurs when you have hit a peak in the argument

00:55:09.15 in that person's opinion and they just need to leave they just need space and

00:55:13.22 then they they walk out I think it's like I've hit a mac so I'm leaving this

00:55:18.03 because I can no longer engage in this and I hate that

00:55:21.02 because I'd rather just for me personally how I operate it's like well

00:55:24.07 that nothing has been solved by the storm the storm has not solved this

00:55:28.06 conflict so I've realized go ahead well I've just got my

00:55:31.22 experience with storming is a little different but go ahead that's fair as I

00:55:35.19 said I think it's probably just my experience with storming I've realized

00:55:40.21 I'm a storm chaser Geoff I [ __ ] I hate it

00:55:43.02 that's my biggest annoyance with this you don't want to be a storm chaser and

00:55:46.21 that's my annoyance with the storm is not only is it unsettled I now you're

00:55:51.16 now forcing me to move you're now forcing me to change my scenery it's

00:55:55.14 like a reverse I'm chasing the storm I don't like it but I don't like that

00:55:59.14 if someone's storming out they want to be alone or away from you yeah they're

00:56:04.00 trying to leave you so why don't you no you got to let the

00:56:06.16 storm no you got to let the storm settle it depends on the storm you got to let

00:56:10.22 it you don't run into the high of a hurricane you got to like let it calm

00:56:14.18 down a little bit you got to let things settle but ultimately things are still

00:56:19.05 unresolved so you got to clear things up you got to clean it up a little bit so

00:56:22.14 then I end up chasing the storm eventually yeah you're just defeated I'm

00:56:25.13 not absolutely storm because the storm needs to settle without you

00:56:29.11 yeah you're causing the storm listen I've I've been in the eyes of

00:56:33.12 many storms and I've always come out correct on the other side I've got a

00:56:38.12 great read for storm entry and leaving I want to know why you're pissing all

00:56:41.18 these people off.

00:56:45.07 I can't believe you've never stormed out of anywhere I can't think of a time in

00:56:49.16 which I have because you said you opened a door hard or you did you open it or

00:56:52.21 close it and you like hurt your foot or something yeah I like opened it in

00:56:56.10 frustration because it was like seven different things were all going wrong

00:57:00.02 but you're not counting that as a door as a store and then slammed it no that's

00:57:03.20 not because I didn't leave yeah I didn't leave my space so even if you couldn't

00:57:07.09 like storm into a cabinet because you can't get in there

00:57:10.04 that's a walk-in pantry maybe just for the record if I ever storm out

00:57:15.12 of a room with either of you and I've probably done it with you a few times

00:57:20.04 Gavin in person uh um I think you stormed in a lot

00:57:23.12 ah yeah I remember I remember one time yelling at you you specifically and you

00:57:31.05 guys in achievement hunter during a production it was

00:57:34.15 and I think I stormed at that time but uh when

00:57:38.15 like for me when I storm out I'm doing it for you because I have hit a point

00:57:43.14 where I'm going to say something and I can't like I'm a pretty controlled

00:57:48.12 dude uh for the most part but I get to a point when I get angry enough that my

00:57:54.06 mouth will say [ __ ] that I know I shouldn't say that I that I get too

00:57:59.09 mean or too angry I could be too hurtful

00:58:02.23 so when I storm out of a room I'm trying to stop myself from from saying

00:58:07.16 something so mean or hurtful that it could

00:58:09.19 uh cause repercussions later so I'm like

00:58:11.22 I'm trying to like I'm getting trying to get away from the situation because I

00:58:15.10 can feel my mouth about to get away from me and can I say this Geoff if that were

00:58:20.00 the case if I was in that scenario with you I would know not to follow ah I

00:58:23.11 would let that storm cool off a little bit I wouldn't I wouldn't immediately

00:58:27.01 pursue that's like the the cow and twister you know like that's

00:58:30.09 coming by you've hit peak you're not going in one to a cow storm yeah you

00:58:34.21 don't want to be dodging cows no you don't what a great movie that is I just

00:58:38.16 love twister what maybe that oh what a dumb Philip Seymour Hoffman is so good

00:58:43.08 did that movie extreme he's so obnoxious so dumb yeah I feel like

00:58:49.05 I feel like I'm a silent stormer like I I storm out it's you wouldn't you won't

00:58:55.07 realize I'm like an Irish stormer I'm an Irish storm I just quietly leave

00:59:00.08 a very polite Irish storm Jesus I'm not swinging doors around [Laughter]

00:59:06.06 I want like a weather report going forward you know how that movie

00:59:10.13 feels like god that movie must have come out 20 years ago at this point

00:59:15.20 around that yeah it was 2000 wasn't it a lot of people in that movie are dead

00:59:19.15 now they are that's sad Phillip yeah Phillip Seymour hoffman's dead paxton's

00:59:24.15 dead uh anyone else or is it just the two I

00:59:27.03 mean that's still crazy I'm sure there's other people that were involved in the

00:59:30.17 film that have died I guarantee you absolutely yeah 100 my favorite thing

00:59:34.08 about that movie is that the villains are the villains because they have

00:59:37.14 corporate sponsorship it's like the only real difference between the two groups

00:59:42.09 they're not images for the thrill of the storm they've gone corporate how dare

00:59:46.12 they and then they treat them like real villains like some [ __ ] they do some

00:59:52.10 harsh things to those characters and uh maybe my memory is wrong but are they

00:59:57.03 the least villainous villains in the movie I think they're [ __ ] but I

01:00:00.21 think like largely their conflict is is based around the fact that they have

01:00:04.16 income that they're being paid to like chase storms and they got fancy vehicles

01:00:08.18 they do have fancy vehicles corporate it's such a dumb the [ __ ] the story

01:00:13.09 do you know why he's the extreme he dropped the bottle of jack Daniels

01:00:18.12 and it never hit the ground it's so [ __ ] dumb it's a great movie does he

01:00:23.01 die in that movie who Hoffman Hoffman no no none of the good guys die just the

01:00:27.16 bad guys because they're they're corporate isn't there a good guy that

01:00:31.16 gets dinged in the head with like a hubcap or something [Laughter]

01:00:39.05 I've never I've never heard of death be described more comedically

01:00:44.06 I don't want to go out by ding I don't want to be dinged to death

01:00:50.06 dinged by hubcap [Laughter]

01:00:54.20 ugh god damn this is fun yeah this was good it was nice to sneak a little one

01:00:59.20 out right before the end of the year and
