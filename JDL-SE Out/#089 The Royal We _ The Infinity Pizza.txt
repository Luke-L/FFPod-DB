00:00:51.18 based off of that great read that great promotion that we had I'm sure they they

00:00:57.05 flew off the shelves let's fail we can start that way hello what what

00:01:02.11 we haven't started what do you mean we can start that way

00:01:06.04 we haven't started I thought we started why would you think we'd started because

00:01:12.07 we always we have you even heard Gavin is he around yeah okay

00:01:17.07 Jesus Christ I'm worried about speaking to be honest is everybody recording yes

00:01:23.03 okay hello and welcome to what podcast this is episode 89. My name is

00:01:32.11 Geoff Ramsey and with me as always uh the

00:01:35.11 other two yes hello other two hello what uh Andrew you were saying

00:01:41.09 uh in the pre-start not the pleasantries but the pre-start uh that the the the

00:01:47.18 pink tiki mugs or uh tiki toilets as I affectionately refer to them yeah uh

00:01:53.22 have been flying off the shelves thanks to gavin's stellar promotion last

00:01:58.15 episode in the last 30 seconds I would hope so because they're awesome

00:02:03.02 they are really yeah I genuinely think they're great and I'm so excited for

00:02:06.04 them we've done merch meetings for for months where it's been a thing that has

00:02:09.16 been brought up of like where are the mugs where are the tiki mugs I'm so

00:02:13.13 happy they're finally here I can't wait to get one so what happened to the

00:02:16.21 originals okay I can I can answer this so

00:02:20.13 originally we got so first off it took a while for them to build a prototype

00:02:24.22 right they had to design it in the 3d space then I think they did like a 3d

00:02:29.02 print to test it and come up with it uh just right uh I think that was like tony

00:02:34.02 and Tobin and those guys did all that and then they sent it off to a

00:02:37.12 manufacturer manufacturer sent back samples I apologize I'm getting this

00:02:41.18 wrong ecom team but uh I believe the samples came back and they were not of

00:02:45.11 the quality that we felt comfortable with

00:02:47.23 and so we went through a couple rounds of that could never get it just right so

00:02:52.04 they went to a different uh distributor and then supply chain issues became a

00:02:57.14 reality and so that's why it took an extra long amount of time but uh but now

00:03:02.09 we got him we well we had him I I think they may already all be gone by now

00:03:06.07 because we're recording in the future uh we have to record 800 episodes in the

00:03:10.06 future uh apparently should we get into that well before we get into that the

00:03:15.03 last thing on merch we brought up the skateboard last episode

00:03:19.00 oh right I kinda want one cause I wanna I wanna try to I haven't I haven't

00:03:24.10 attempted to ride a skateboard since the mvp accident I retired on that day

00:03:29.02 I wanna try to ride a skateboard again I

00:03:31.09 feel like this would be the perfect time to try it the only thing the only thing

00:03:35.12 that's holding me back to fully committing this idea is that tom segura

00:03:39.10 exists and he tried to dunk a basketball she wouldn't think

00:03:43.12 would be disastrous but didn't he like broke his whole body in half and had to

00:03:47.07 have like serious surgery snapped his arm in half so it was bent backwards but

00:03:51.16 that wasn't even the worst part he like he tore like a patella or something in

00:03:55.16 his knee and like basically ended his leg and

00:03:58.14 like had to do had to go through like multiple surgeries to repair it all yeah

00:04:02.23 uh but he was trying to jump you're just trying to escape so yeah but I'm gonna

00:04:07.02 like there's no way I don't eat [ __ ] and

00:04:09.02 Gavin has already got me concerned about death why why because even door handles

00:04:13.02 are dangerous and gavin's well because door handles are dangerous aren't and I

00:04:17.03 could be wrong maybe Geoff said it I don't remember at this point weren't you

00:04:20.21 the one that asked will we all be alive eight years ago oh yeah I just don't

00:04:24.17 think I just wonder I wonder was that you that said it not Gavin no I

00:04:27.23 didn't say that I said I'd try and stay alive a little bit that's not a very

00:04:31.03 Gavin thing to say no it's not but you both have death on my mind because you

00:04:35.05 said that Geoff that's you know death thing then a few

00:04:39.16 weeks ago several weeks several episodes at this point Gavin you told a story

00:04:43.19 about how in the snow you would walk by houses and if there weren't

00:04:47.23 footprints then you would be like are they dead you'd play play the dead we

00:04:51.12 called it a game where you would try to decide if somebody had died or not guess

00:04:56.12 who might be dead yep yeah you said that there is a red car

00:05:00.08 parked outside of my apartment that I could see and it had snow with snow and

00:05:05.09 nobody went to it for like six days and I had never thought about it before

00:05:08.22 but now every time I see that car I wonder if that person's dead

00:05:12.14 every time I look out my window I'm confronted with the thought of death

00:05:16.07 because of you there's something I never thought about but now it's all I can

00:05:19.11 think about so it's just I I got death on the brain I'd be terrified of getting

00:05:23.14 on the board but I might do it I don't know I'm on the fence

00:05:27.20 you're gonna just be looking at that differently for forever now forever

00:05:31.11 until that literally until unless somebody gets in that car and drives

00:05:34.13 away which I don't think it's been turned on in probably over a month at

00:05:38.00 this point that car is [ __ I dead well maybe it's because there's snow

00:05:41.11 everywhere I don't want to drive no it's sunny out now

00:05:44.13 maybe no I've never seen anyone touch that car ever maybe the car is abandoned

00:05:48.20 our friend gus one time had a had an old car that he kind of gave up on

00:05:53.16 and he had it parked on the street in front of his house and then he moved to

00:05:57.06 a new house and he just left the car there and for like three or four months

00:06:01.23 he eventually had a toad I think but for

00:06:04.00 like three or four months we would drive

00:06:05.16 by and people would just put signs on it they were like please for the love of

00:06:09.12 god remove this car it's not funny anymore what's going on

00:06:12.18 when when I went by with them someone had chucked like a dozen eggs on it

00:06:18.04 they would have felt pretty they would have felt bad about themselves if he had

00:06:22.23 just been dead in that house the whole time

00:06:25.01 I was just egging the full dead person's car

00:06:28.13 I can go out to check the car that's going to have ham fan it's the license

00:06:33.09 plate dude I'll do you one better what if somebody's dead in the car nah I

00:06:38.16 think I'd know I think that would be discovered

00:06:42.10 probably steam up on the inside you think so I think so or are you gonna say

00:06:46.12 Geoff before I took it to death you're gonna take us somewhere no I don't

00:06:49.23 you're leading us you're doing you're doing you're doing a really good job

00:06:54.02 thanks uh you were saying you want a skateboard

00:06:56.12 so yeah before that I brought us to skateboard talk but you're gonna take it

00:07:00.12 somewhere else I didn't want to step on because you I don't even know dude as of

00:07:04.20 two weeks ago you have teased subjects that you had written and we still

00:07:08.15 haven't covered them oh god uh they weren't yeah one of them was uh

00:07:13.14 well okay so you know how we had the idea for

00:07:18.21 this might inspire a longer conversation than the other am I recording okay yeah

00:07:25.00 oh my god why would you say that I was just curious I was pretty sure I was

00:07:28.16 okay the one who was livid that we hadn't started the show yet is the one

00:07:31.23 who didn't know whether he was recording I'll do this one first so I was

00:07:35.10 listening to uh planet money the other day and uh which is where we got the

00:07:40.13 they're the people that that uh inspired the superhero conversation so uh mine

00:07:44.18 and their their their content for to steal more ideas uh and uh actually I'm

00:07:49.07 not it was just like you know how you play on on Alexa you can say like play

00:07:53.14 my daily briefing or whatever and then I'll just play and then when it's over

00:07:57.03 it just keeps playing forever it'll just

00:07:58.23 keep throwing [ __ ] at ya well it threw some planet money at me uh after my

00:08:02.17 briefing was over and it was interesting it was on the subject of sound ids

00:08:06.10 and I don't know if you know what that is Andrew I had this conversation with

00:08:09.16 Gavin actually in person because we went out to dinner the other night which by

00:08:12.21 the way I had a lovely time at dinner with Gavin and

00:08:15.12 his wonderful girlfriend meg and my girlfriend and and another friend but

00:08:18.16 man are were you in a bad mood at dinner

00:08:20.18 I don't know what your deal was it's not going to work every week you're saying

00:08:24.08 that I'm not no I'm serious we left and Italy

00:08:28.00 was like we were in the car and Emily was like what was wrong with Gavin and I

00:08:33.09 was like I don't know what what I'm not

00:08:35.17 I don't know ask her are you serious you came across as like really surly and

00:08:39.18 annoyed and I I didn't know if it was because your friend was there or what

00:08:43.09 but it was bizarre is it because we sat down to the meal

00:08:46.08 and you said why are you in such a bad mood [Music]

00:08:50.00 did I you're making me self-conscious about

00:08:53.17 when am I in a bad mood I don't get is Emily there she no she's at work man dad

00:08:58.15 I'll I'll ask her tonight when she gets home uh if she remembers why she said

00:09:02.09 that uh she seemed really concerned it was a nice time

00:09:05.22 now I'm gonna be second guessing every time we hang out

00:09:10.00 try to remember what happened.

00:09:13.16 I I like that this whole part started with Gavin saying well that's not gonna

00:09:18.22 work every week and now we're here I guess it works every week

00:09:24.09 every week with it it really does oh man that's great but if Emily said it it's

00:09:28.21 real nah if she didn't I made that part up but thank you uh

00:09:33.09 anyway um but thanks for thanks for showing me that your skin is is still as

00:09:38.07 thin as tissue paper worrying me god I appreciate that uh

00:09:42.15 man that felt great that felt really that made me feel good on the inside you

00:09:45.23 made me feel good about me briefly there uh I appreciate that

00:09:49.12 anyway so we uh so I already had this idea with Gavin uh he was in a great

00:09:52.10 mood by the way lovely we had a wonderful dinner everybody had it we

00:09:56.00 laughed it was everybody was over the moon

00:09:57.17 we talked about how we should do it more often we enjoy each other's company so

00:10:01.18 much it was it was a delightful evening from start to finish not a not a

00:10:04.23 negative moment uh throughout the evening uh except it was windy outside I

00:10:08.21 think we all agree it was too windy it was too much [Laughter]

00:10:13.03 so anyway on this planet money thing they were they were it was all about

00:10:17.17 sound ids and uh which not something I'd

00:10:20.08 ever thought of before but a sound id is like like when you turn on hbo in the

00:10:24.09 old days and it would go the snow like and it would do the hbo sound like the

00:10:28.11 dun dun dun or whatever that's not anybody's sound idea it's uh because now

00:10:32.19 that I'm thinking of it all sound ids have fled my brain uh or like when you

00:10:37.03 you know when you load up hulu or when you get like a text from like in

00:10:40.11 Facebook you get like an instant message or something it makes an identifiable

00:10:44.15 sound that you subconsciously start to recognize and and associate with that

00:10:48.11 product uh and it was all about how uh actually hbo I guess was spending like a

00:10:54.00 bunch of money and effort trying to recreate new sound ids that

00:10:57.17 made sense for the current times because they'd felt that theirs were dated it

00:11:01.09 wasn't just about hbo is about some other businesses too and about like the

00:11:06.13 science that goes into it and how to perfectly like how difficult it is to

00:11:11.22 kind of perfectly design a short interstitial sound that then becomes

00:11:15.15 synonymous with that brand in a positive way uh and as I was going through all

00:11:21.16 that I was thinking like man face could really benefit

00:11:25.11 from a sound id like what would our sound id like our like you hear it and

00:11:29.10 you instantly think of face b so I was just opening that up for a

00:11:33.00 conversation because we also we have been discussing and we may already have

00:11:36.00 it at this point but if we have if we don't yet audience I would love your

00:11:39.12 assistance we want to build a sound board of face sounds for the break show

00:11:44.02 uh with like you know Andrew saying like my name's in japan and I will eat the

00:11:48.13 pencil and like all the other different funny things that we say uh

00:11:53.16 it's maybe like soda burping and and that time Andrew farted on on uh on mike

00:11:57.20 uh whatever your favorite little audio moments are but uh I'd like to collect

00:12:02.08 those for a sound board but also like what should our I mean I assume it would

00:12:07.11 be the grown tube sound but yeah I just wanted to see what you guys thought

00:12:12.15 that should face a sound idb I so can anything be is any so hmm

00:12:17.05 because I'm thinking like what about the Wilhelm scream is that a sound id does

00:12:22.00 somebody own that does somebody make money every time Wilhelm dies

00:12:26.12 how does that work I mean I think it was

00:12:29.11 made from like a for a big audio library wasn't it was it

00:12:33.07 is that his name Wilhelm where'd the name Wilhelm come from uh also has he

00:12:37.14 died more than Sean bean who has more total movie I definitely

00:12:41.08 definitely died more than so I mean I used to know the answer that I googled

00:12:44.06 it once but I don't remember now I think it's an interesting idea I like I like

00:12:47.13 the sound idea I never considered what the sound of face would be I think it'd

00:12:52.02 be the sound of a someone getting kicked and then like a kid crying

00:12:58.19 it never happened it was close to half but it didn't happen man talk about

00:13:05.09 becoming an even less sponsor able podcast

00:13:11.03 it's called face it's got a kid crying at the beginning of every episode

00:13:17.22 oh anyway just something for y'all to think about I'm excited to see the

00:13:22.18 responses for that because yeah this is such a [ __ ] their show is so dumb the

00:13:28.04 things that I forget that we did like genuinely like two nights ago I was

00:13:32.21 getting it it was late I was going to bed and I just randomly had this

00:13:38.02 realization that we we we've put garlic on our feet and I

00:13:41.19 forgot that we had done oh my foot was in a garlic bag Gavin spread it like it

00:13:47.08 was toast on his foot we did a whole we covered our foot in garlic and I forgot

00:13:52.18 about it that was not a thing then I forgot about that too yeah [ __ ] crazy

00:13:58.10 oh that's low enough to not register one of

00:14:03.20 that was my thought so weird how did I forget that [ __ ]

00:14:08.12 oh it was terrible it was gross that was that that was disgusting

00:14:12.21 do you know Geoff that food wise we've discovered andrew's next British food

00:14:18.02 that he's going to try on the podcast no

00:14:21.20 what is it we're going to go for marmite oh yeah

00:14:24.10 marmite because that's quite an obvious one I feel like uh it's a bit of a

00:14:28.13 low-hanging fruit you've never had marmite or vegemite right I do we I

00:14:33.05 thought we were going with the whole box of items is that off the table

00:14:37.06 are we doing the brit nick's never had it either but I have a

00:14:40.20 feeling nick would eat it and be like oh I like it this is good and then you

00:14:44.02 squirt the whole thing in his mouth I want to pay Gavin

00:14:48.23 to make me a subscription style box of British items a brit box

00:14:53.04 exactly this came up because I said I was watching something on brick box

00:14:56.13 which is like a streaming service and I was like that sounds like a subscription

00:15:00.23 food thing where like an American company would try to trick people into

00:15:05.16 that these are like classic British items

00:15:07.20 a nice subscription to your salad creams and your breakfast pickle your marmite

00:15:12.14 I'd love a brick box I'm excited to try I forgot that that was my next item so

00:15:17.11 you want me to do your whole box I would

00:15:20.08 I think it would be funny to do a whole box but you don't have to could start

00:15:24.01 small marmite is there a box worth of stuff I'm missing there has to be yeah

00:15:29.05 yeah I could get I could get you a box together okay or maybe we do the brit

00:15:34.23 box in the future [Applause]

00:19:28.00 episode was track one last episode was track one I had no idea we were even we

00:19:33.14 had even turned the scene the cd player on why would we wait why would

00:19:37.04 why we have to record I didn't know how many we record I thought we might record

00:19:40.15 three Geoff thought this was pleasantries Geoff

00:19:43.14 thought this is pleasantry I thought this was the truth

00:19:47.20 to the album of recording you're saying that I'm jumping the gun

00:19:53.02 this was something I wrote for track one didn't even get used to track one

00:19:57.12 almost all track one is available track three is the best though right

00:20:01.05 track three is the best almost always almost always I

00:20:04.19 later wrote down in track one that I expected Geoff to start using the topics

00:20:09.16 I sent him to [ __ ] with me which he ended up doing but not

00:20:13.14 realizing he was doing it it was accidental not understanding the system

00:20:18.13 I thought I thought we're gonna open the show and Geoff's gonna be like since I

00:20:21.19 sent him my notes for the first recording he's immediately just gonna go

00:20:25.14 into what I sent him it's like this is what I want to do do you shed notes now

00:20:29.05 when's this because of the uh no it's because of you because we're yeah

00:20:34.14 we thought you would be gone for like eight months and so we're I'm like we're

00:20:40.08 gonna record 12 episodes in two weeks to cover for Gavin being busy

00:20:43.23 so I was like I'm approaching this like I gotta like spread [ __ ] out and so if

00:20:48.10 we're trying to fill 12 or 13 episodes in a short time it's like we should send

00:20:53.03 notes we've never done this before this is these are my notes

00:20:56.10 why can't I see the notes I don't know why you can't because you didn't reply

00:20:59.14 to jingle jingle honestly because I didn't I felt weird to then follow up

00:21:03.17 you didn't get the notes because if it helps Kevin I didn't send him [ __ ]

00:21:07.11 he just sent me the notes when I look at him I'm like okay I like if we didn't

00:21:11.09 record today with that jingle jingle jingle would have been the last entry in

00:21:14.23 our text potentially forever why are you planning on never responding

00:21:19.18 after this who me yeah why would it be potentially

00:21:22.18 forever because he didn't want to say anything often I didn't reply to jingle

00:21:26.02 jingle no I would have replied I would have replied today but not in I felt

00:21:30.03 like I had to wait okay for yesterday anyway so we decided that if we have to

00:21:35.03 plan an uh uh 10 or 12 tracks worth of content that it

00:21:39.00 might behoove us to share notes just so that we can build up like make sure

00:21:42.12 they're all equally they have stuff in them like it's but that was the idea

00:21:46.19 sounds like that's not really the case anyway uh because you're not gonna be

00:21:50.11 gone as long as we thought or whatever so I guess I don't know I don't know

00:21:53.19 what this does to your album structure I don't think it'd be very good if we had

00:21:57.05 to actually do like eight at once what a [ __ ] stupid conversation we just had

00:22:01.08 well I just wanted to talk about the royal you you did this

00:22:05.16 and not the royal you royal the royal you specifically not no not the royal us

00:22:11.05 you just you the royal you what do you mean what are you confused about

00:22:16.13 no Geoff not us the royal when people say the royal you I don't

00:22:22.13 know what it means but I know what it hang means

00:22:26.15 wait when you say the royal you you're just using a term you've heard

00:22:31.07 well that's sort of what I'm saying I know

00:22:35.02 I know what it means when someone says okay I'll just give the example in which

00:22:40.13 I heard it they said we and then they paused and they said well

00:22:44.19 not we you know the royal we the royal we the term the royal we I believe

00:22:50.04 means we as like a collective not specifically us

00:22:53.14 just like a group that isn't us not us but hypothetically us not uh not us

00:23:00.21 personally us as a group right does this make am I am I just doing no

00:23:07.11 no this is great I'm right but I don't know why I guess

00:23:11.20 is what I'm saying like I don't does is it at all connected to royalty

00:23:17.03 what is the royal like why why is it the royal we why is it the royal what I

00:23:22.19 don't know like I never questioned that the royal we

00:23:26.12 the first person plural used by a person with supreme authority or in modern

00:23:32.05 times sometimes we preserve anonymity supposedly the first king to use we in

00:23:36.13 this way was Richard the first in the charter to win Gavin knows all about

00:23:40.10 this charter to Winchester 1190. Uh I mean I'm sure you could probably

00:23:44.07 take off from there and just regale us with British knowledge

00:23:48.00 but I'll I'll just keep going we are not amused is a rebuke often attributed to

00:23:52.21 straight-laced queen Victoria in the 20th century I'm putting myself to sleep

00:23:56.06 reading this who cares you are I mean this is very boring I just don't know

00:23:59.06 what it means I've never I don't know where the royal comes from in the royal

00:24:03.12 we or the royal you I get the word that follows the royal part I never

00:24:07.08 understand why it's there and why it means what it means

00:24:10.12 and it sounds like I'm not alone I don't think anyone here does

00:24:13.14 and that makes me feel better I didn't know if it was a me thing or if that was

00:24:16.17 just the thing that people didn't know I don't know that I've ever heard anybody

00:24:21.11 say the royal you uh yeah that's that's lesson use

00:24:26.00 I hear the royal we all the time yeah uh to include like

00:24:31.07 like a a a a a yeah you is very specific that was a terrible example to use for

00:24:36.18 it but the royal we what if what if you what if you I mean

00:24:40.18 sometimes you doesn't mean you the person you're talking to

00:24:44.07 it doesn't one is well you can say like uh you know getting on a plane allows

00:24:48.05 you to go skydiving but it doesn't necessarily mean you're gonna go

00:24:52.21 skydiving that's true let's the royal year is gonna go skydiving yeah

00:25:00.10 let's like that I don't know what like blood is thicker than water I know what

00:25:04.23 that means but I don't know what like what I don't huh what does that mean the

00:25:09.09 expression the phrase are you just listing off different expressions that

00:25:12.13 you know no I don't know what they mean it's like the royal thing I don't know

00:25:17.20 what the royal means I don't know what any of that means either the royal like

00:25:21.19 when you say like the royal we I think it's it harkens back to like everybody

00:25:25.20 in the kingdom right like everybody under the everybody

00:25:30.06 in the serfdom or whatever of that royalty okay it's kind of the etymology

00:25:34.10 everybody okay of that example on Wikipedia where they're just

00:25:37.13 there's basically like a land dispute and the king

00:25:41.11 writes that you know we have arrived at this decision

00:25:44.20 it's blood water what is blood made up water in it it's water right it's the

00:25:49.04 water base blood has water in it everything has water in it everything

00:25:53.20 that was going to be my next I realized that I don't know what blood is it's

00:25:57.08 water and every liquid is water well there's different amounts of water

00:26:02.06 in different liquids probably less in syrup but it's all

00:26:07.03 all forms of liquid have water in them I would say so well not

00:26:11.14 maybe not like certain [Music]

00:26:13.19 gases in liquid form huh yeah things can be in a liquid state

00:26:18.00 like liquid nitrogen doesn't have water in it how thick is blood it's viscous

00:26:24.00 this is water and it's just a weird expression because I would blood is

00:26:30.00 thicker than water but it's not it's not thicker than gravy [Music]

00:26:36.17 depends on depends on the gravy though that's true I guess

00:26:41.16 it's definitely not thicker than like like white

00:26:45.18 sausage biscuit gravy but it might be you're not gonna get the money you're

00:26:51.05 not even related to him by gravy

00:26:54.15 and by the way the answer is no according to the internet water is one

00:26:59.05 of many liquids but not necessarily uh all liquids okay thank you

00:27:03.14 mercury uh mercury has no water in it when it's in liquid form

00:27:08.09 huh yeah I guess any base element if it doesn't have hydrogen or oxygen there's

00:27:12.02 no water in it okay okay I was going to say something dumb I'm

00:27:16.05 not going to we're going to move past it we're going to save yeah it's fine

00:27:22.02 do you ever do you ever [ __ ] up and then

00:27:24.23 nobody notices that was not one of those times if you had one of those recently

00:27:30.23 where like you royally [ __ ] something up royally ha that was an

00:27:34.03 accident proud of that one bounce back from the bread clip baby

00:27:38.11 drop it in a royally accidentally um for the audience he's referencing the

00:27:43.18 bread clip joke that fell flat last episode a week ago for you but about 30

00:27:49.21 minutes ago for us yes I uh what's going on Gavin I just can't believe

00:27:58.15 how much that tripped you up I thought it was a fine comment you really just

00:28:03.21 dwelled on that friend you got you got you got in your head about it pretty

00:28:07.11 hard no you guys weren't there you didn't you didn't deliver it

00:28:12.02 I was apparently messing up left and right last last episode like my o's

00:28:16.21 weren't good I wasn't laughing at the comments you had a terrible o it was

00:28:21.21 brutal had a bad o if that was the example of o I would have it taken out

00:28:26.08 of the I would just have it removed as a letter I'd be like we don't need it we

00:28:30.10 got down to 25. Not if that's what it's gonna be

00:28:33.12 it felt like I don't know like if if you throw a hail Mary and everybody's like

00:28:38.07 watching like oh man is it gonna is it gonna land and you threw it out of the

00:28:41.08 stadium is how it felt like like not only did it not land but it couldn't

00:28:45.10 have missed further uh it was three layers so who knows how many seats it

00:28:50.06 leaves a lot a lot of room to guess oh man go ahead.

00:29:02.00 I don't know where you're going I was trying to I was trying to get into

00:29:06.15 we pivoted into weird I [ __ ] up are you talking about

00:29:09.20 when you try and hide that you've made a mistake or that yeah or no they're like

00:29:14.10 both how often do you get away with it not on this podcast but when it does

00:29:19.08 happen it there's that moment of like you start sweating that someone's gonna

00:29:23.07 call you on it I had a really bad one recently that's why I'm bringing up I'm

00:29:26.10 just curious if you have had those or this is one that I think will stick with

00:29:29.22 me for a while I I mean I think everybody probably has

00:29:33.11 had those at some point in their life but why don't you dive into this one I

00:29:37.00 was reading the donkey Kong wrap this one does

00:29:40.15 talking about the donkey Kong right and then it's funny because

00:29:43.18 there are in the in the donkey Kong rap there is like the first two verses are

00:29:48.10 all very complimentary it's like donkey Kong is great let's talk about how great

00:29:52.00 donkey Kong is then the next kind they're great and then it goes to lanky

00:29:56.02 Kong and the lanky Kong verse is just [ __ ] on lanky Kong well he has no

00:30:01.05 style he has no grace this Kong has a funny face like it's

00:30:04.22 they just they're just [ __ ] [ __ ]

00:30:07.00 On lanky Kong he doesn't get a great verse and so I was trying to prove that

00:30:10.15 point so I was reading I was reading the lyrics to it

00:30:14.15 and I got to the the lanky Kong part and uh I should have

00:30:20.12 I should have I should have wrote this down but essentially it ends with this

00:30:25.11 Kong really digs this tune as the end of the lyric something like that it ends

00:30:30.10 with tune as the final word I misread the exclamation as an I and I said this

00:30:34.23 Kong really digs this tunnel

00:30:38.06 not only was it spelled wrong if it was tunnel

00:30:42.06 but I said this I said this to a group of eight people but it was within the

00:30:47.07 context of me talking about how [ __ ] the

00:30:50.13 verse is so I was like this Kong really digs this tunnel somebody

00:30:55.21 somebody somebody went tunnel and I was I immediately realized as soon as

00:31:02.00 I said it now I [ __ ] up tune with the exclamation mark and to be tuna

00:31:08.00 based on how I had read it and just nobody noticed nobody called on

00:31:12.10 it they're just like yeah I guess that is wow what a weird rhyme at all

00:31:17.15 nobody said anything it registered that tunnel didn't at all

00:31:21.11 fit but because of how much talk was said about how shitty the verse was and

00:31:25.19 that it didn't flow very well when did you realize later on like after the

00:31:29.21 covenant oh as soon as the I as soon as the all the tunnel left my mouth I

00:31:34.21 realized what I had done so what you could have just corrected yourself

00:31:38.20 so um I thought about it and then because I thought about it too much time

00:31:43.06 had passed by the time it came to make that decision it was like eight seconds

00:31:47.02 had passed and am I really gonna like hey I need to we need to go back to that

00:31:51.09 let me explain the moment had passed I didn't feel like I could correct it it

00:31:56.13 wasn't like the bread clip or me saying my dynasty being or whatever I

00:32:00.21 [ __ ] whatever that was too much time had passed the moment had

00:32:04.16 passed so I couldn't correct it so this is curious it's been that happened four

00:32:08.11 days ago I've think about it constantly it hasn't left my brain this Hong Kong

00:32:14.08 really digs this tunnel so looking at the lyrics the end of that verse is

00:32:20.02 inflate himself just like a balloon this crazy Kong just digs this tune so

00:32:24.04 yeah he would have said it would have had to have inflated

00:32:28.05 himself like a balonel [Laughter]

00:32:38.08 it was bad it has haunted me so I was just curious.

00:32:45.14 I was curious if either of you had that recently

00:32:49.12 I just love that donkey Kong rap so can I ask you guys a question terrible where

00:32:54.17 does it come from donkey on 64. Oh it's like it's this is

00:32:58.08 it from the soundtrack of the game it's like the first thing that happens when

00:33:01.15 you turn the game on it's oh okay I never played it until I don't know okay

00:33:05.20 gotcha we have a bat we have a donkey Kong bet we even talk to you about Geoff

00:33:10.12 you're gonna have an opportunity to experience donkey Kong that is part of

00:33:15.11 the redemption here okay so I Gavin Gavin's like childhood game

00:33:18.22 and we talked about the show at that time loved it loved it he could never

00:33:23.04 beat it so then I was like you know what

00:33:25.01 I'm gonna finish it I even made a twitch account at that time called Andrew the

00:33:28.23 donkey Kong guy and then I got far I got 80 of the way through the game

00:33:33.09 and then I lost my save file it just finished it crashed and there's a lot

00:33:38.13 it's a lot to do in that game and so I've been thinking

00:33:41.04 about giving it another try but I can't just re it's not the greatest of games

00:33:45.20 it's not all that much fun to play people speak of it so fondly though I

00:33:50.11 think it's a nostalgia thing but it's not it's not a great game uh so I

00:33:54.09 thought if I'm gonna do this again there needs to be odds

00:33:58.10 we need to have something on the line for it so I pitched

00:34:01.14 Gavin a donkey Kong bat I will stream I will read do everything like I did

00:34:06.02 before I'll stream it again but this time on the facepod twitch account which

00:34:11.01 is a thing we have but I've never used I'll stream it I have 48 hours to beat

00:34:15.01 it and I plan on just trying to play as much as I can continuously to beat it or

00:34:19.05 100

00:34:20.19 to finish it not a hundred percent it definitely okay so you just gotta beat k

00:34:25.07 rule at the end I do I have to hit credits or whatever okay to beat the

00:34:28.21 final box any any percent at any percent how long is it supposed to take to

00:34:34.12 finish apparently like 30 hours is the average play through okay

00:34:38.11 so you've got 48 hours yeah here's something when we discussed

00:34:42.16 on text we're like sort of figuring out I was trying to think of ways you could

00:34:48.17 well cheat basically people are you allowed are you allowed to use

00:34:53.01 glitches or skips no okay you're just gonna play yeah if one

00:34:56.16 happens accidentally I don't think that disqualifies me like if I'm jumping

00:35:00.23 through a wall and I just like end up through it I don't think that if it's a

00:35:04.12 bug or a glitch that helps me but it's done accidentally I think I'm fine and

00:35:10.06 you'll be using you'll be using uh earth hours not like lunar or like martian

00:35:15.12 hours I'll be using I'll be using earth hours okay um so you've got 48 earth

00:35:19.10 hours yeah I don't we need to I guess figure out I'm not sure when all you're

00:35:23.09 gonna have to cheat somehow and I'm just trying to think ahead of how you're

00:35:26.16 gonna I'm either gonna cheat or lose and that's where we come to the stakes of

00:35:30.09 this bed because every every bet needs steaks

00:35:32.22 I have a victory thing we could talk about this because Gavin doesn't know I

00:35:37.09 had this idea for it uh if I lose this is what we came up with we can we

00:35:41.19 can workshop this I'd like to hear your thoughts on it Geoff you know my feelings

00:35:45.18 on bananas if I lose this bet I have to eat a

00:35:49.12 banana every day for the next 64 days you know what first off I think that

00:35:54.04 makes sense in a lot of ways but I'm glad you brought up bananas I I I went

00:35:57.18 ahead and closed down my banana research because I didn't think we'd

00:36:01.03 ever get back to bananas but I did a little bit of reading on bananas did you

00:36:05.18 know there are over a thousand varieties of

00:36:10.08 banana that vary wildly in taste and consistency I think that there probably

00:36:15.17 is a banana out there for you Andrew we just you just haven't found it because

00:36:19.13 you're eating the cavendish banana which is like the by far the most common

00:36:23.23 available banana that's very possible you you could totally be right and I

00:36:27.07 don't mind the taste it's really a texture thing so assuming there's a

00:36:31.00 range in the same way apples has there's a scenario in which I could all of a

00:36:35.05 sudden like a banana probably just an obscure banana I'd have to eat 64 bananas

00:36:40.15 every day I'd be open to recording that process and I don't know if we could

00:36:45.17 it would be terrible but something could maybe come from that when it's none can

00:36:49.13 you now can you rate every banana in the moment as you eat it I could for 64

00:36:54.19 bananas just said hang on hang on I'm confused I just want

00:36:58.22 to get clarification okay you're saying you have to eat 64 bananas in one day no

00:37:04.08 I have to eat one banana a day for 64

00:37:06.22 days oh okay okay it was confusing the way he said it yeah okay cool because I

00:37:11.00 thought you were gonna die from yeah poisoning so I wanted to make sure no no

00:37:15.01 no no no no no no part of that thank you no no no one day one banana a day

00:37:20.02 for 64 days and you were originally telling me this as like the punishment

00:37:24.22 and I I was just thinking like well I could easily do that and it wouldn't be

00:37:28.00 a punishment and then I remembered how much you hate

00:37:30.15 bananas and I just thought that's absolutely perfect but yeah you're gonna

00:37:33.22 get so sick of them like a weekend you're just gonna be like dreading your

00:37:37.18 daily banana so this is the idea I have a week a workshop you can workshop this

00:37:42.12 but this is just my original thought if I win the bat I was trying to think

00:37:47.16 of things because it's complicated to come up with a victory thing for me

00:37:52.12 I'll give you a free skateboard freeze game no if I win the bet because you

00:37:57.19 you also do this podcast and you also do

00:38:00.03 the rt podcast which is a visual there's a video component to that show you're

00:38:06.00 speaking to Gavin I'm speaking to Gavin if if I win this bet

00:38:10.19 you have to record an episode of the rt podcast wearing 64 different pieces of

00:38:15.19 clothing uh I like this

00:38:21.01 yeah all right joey like what what how is that where'd you get that from

00:38:26.08 you're gonna pick 64 coats I pick one I can pick one piece of the 64.

00:38:32.19 You can pick the rest okay I have to oh a whole 90 minutes a whole 90 minutes

00:38:39.01 can I wear one of those beer helmets uh with water for hydration yes I'm

00:38:44.15 gonna have like restricted limb movement yeah no you can that's an article of

00:38:50.02 clothing oh what if I just what if I just wear like 30 ties

00:38:53.22 then you'd have you'd you'd need to come up with 34 more items of clothing to go

00:38:59.03 with it hmm do you have 30 ties I've got two [Laughter]

00:39:06.23 what's one with two who needs more than two ties no I agree I agree

00:39:11.14 I'm not arguing oh man I I like the terms I I certainly as an

00:39:18.06 impartial uh judge or just an impartial observer I uh I would certainly sign off

00:39:23.20 on those terms Eric is asking is jewelry clothes jewelry is not clothing I think

00:39:29.10 it's I think the biggest problem here is

00:39:31.16 that it's really easy for Andrew to beat a 30-hour game in a 48-hour window I

00:39:36.12 don't know why that's difficult I don't well

00:39:39.02 it's difficult if I only do that like what do you mean is it hard is the game

00:39:43.20 hard yes it's a tedious difficult there are parts

00:39:46.17 of it that are very difficult that's why Gavin never beat him he will have to

00:39:51.16 be original donkey Kong again on the arcade

00:39:54.01 yeah and there's the slide thing I have to do that's a [ __ ] nightmare there

00:39:57.15 are a few parts of that game that are incredibly difficult yeah it's not uh

00:40:02.01 it's not that easy it's not hard there's just some really like there's some

00:40:05.07 sticking points in it I just feel like he was gonna spend that 30 hours playing

00:40:08.23 halo anyway so now he's just gonna switch to a different console I don't

00:40:13.00 understand your point are you saying 48

00:40:15.06 hours is maybe too long I think it's too

00:40:18.19 much time that gives them two nine hours sleeping sessions

00:40:21.10 but there's no life outside of that yeah

00:40:23.11 yeah you're fit you get a 15-hour day of

00:40:25.11 play video games is your life we we love it what's the longest video game stint

00:40:30.15 you've had ever ever um yeah I don't I'd have to

00:40:35.12 probably like six or seven probably like eight hours when I was playing halo 2

00:40:40.17 and I'd stay up all night playing it well I guess that's probably the longest

00:40:46.17 you know I feel like I feel like you can do this

00:40:50.15 to be honest I'm sick of you losing the bets like I'm really really no no I

00:40:55.14 don't wanna I don't wanna I don't want a pity bet I beat you in the halo bet I

00:41:01.01 wanna I want you to have a decent chance and you've never had a chance with the

00:41:04.16 burgers reduce it reduce it to 44 hours I'm not taking anything no no no no

00:41:10.04 listen we're not nobody's I'm just saying Gavin if I were you I would start

00:41:15.01 collecting ties what if what if you're it's 44 hours but you're allowed

00:41:19.16 to purchase an extra four hours for free you can

00:41:23.20 have them but you have to make that call in the first 24 hours okay

00:41:28.21 okay why wouldn't I make that call though yeah you know it's just uh

00:41:34.13 whether you want to give up on doing it in 44

00:41:38.06 pretty early okay so it's a pride thing I could get behind that because I think

00:41:43.09 the the only real the only person you're battling half the

00:41:46.15 time is yourself and your own confidence that's true it is true

00:41:51.02 yeah that's true yeah do you want to hear a really

00:41:53.17 embarrassing story of my confidence and thought about it is it related to the

00:41:57.06 Denver nuggets uh it's so it's related to sports

00:42:00.11 this is like I think this might be I was gonna say when I told the story this is

00:42:04.06 maybe the first example of burger confidence but that's not true there

00:42:08.10 were previous instances but this is classic burger confidence I'm in the fourth

00:42:14.10 grade I wanna say at this time and I don't know how to ice skate

00:42:18.15 not an ice skater I don't know how to Rollerblade but

00:42:22.04 the local hockey team came to our class that day and they were like doing a

00:42:25.15 thing where it's like oh we're going around the schools you meet the team

00:42:29.00 they hang out they help you with some of the assignments and then at the end of

00:42:32.15 the day you get to play hockey with the team it's just you'd either be in skates

00:42:38.10 or just run this is in the gym I had convinced myself as a child that

00:42:42.07 there is a scenario in which I could join the hockey team based off of this

00:42:47.11 experience I was sat at my desk at lunch being like

00:42:50.08 what if they what if I'm so good at I don't like hockey I never play hockey

00:42:54.00 but in my head I was convinced like what if I happen to be so good at ice hockey

00:42:58.23 it's not even ice hockey it's floor hockey and you hadn't seen a movie with

00:43:03.20 a monkey on ice skates no I have mvp one mvp one is about as it's about the same

00:43:09.09 monthly play maybe it's all tied to mvp my confidence

00:43:13.01 it's all ice skating and monkey related but I thought I genuinely believed that

00:43:18.05 there was a possibility that they would ask me to join the team based off of my

00:43:23.00 hockey playing I was dreadful I didn't like it I was just bad at hockey I I

00:43:27.12 didn't know how to skate they're an ice hockey team I didn't know how to skate

00:43:31.22 but I spent a large portion of that day completely

00:43:34.18 convinced that it wasn't out of the realm of possibility that I would be

00:43:38.10 joining the nanaimo clippers and what that would mean for that feature

00:43:42.12 as a clipper I was also like six years younger than all of them

00:43:47.01 but did you actually get to the point where you were like

00:43:49.14 putting skates on or anything no we did so they at the end of the day we played

00:43:54.08 hockey and the kids that could Rollerblade got put on rollerblades and

00:43:59.03 that was not me so I was just slowly running around the gym being terrible at

00:44:02.19 hockey so you on foot I'm on foot yeah because I don't know how to skate on any

00:44:07.01 level roller skate or ice skate don't know how to do it terrible at it

00:44:11.13 so I'm just slowly running while everybody's skating by me

00:44:15.08 I'm just bad I'm bad at every level of the game but I spent a few hours that

00:44:19.06 day convinced that I was gonna be the next denial clipper and it was a dream

00:44:23.08 that I never had prior to that or cared about the day after I never played hot

00:44:28.10 that's genuinely I think the last time I played hockey

00:44:32.15 it just appeared can I ask a question of course

00:44:37.01 what track is that on than the nymo clippers hockey story

00:44:40.02 what do you mean what track oh this is the uh

00:44:43.14 not not on it's not even on the list oh

00:44:46.10 [ __ ] this is like bonus this is a b-side

00:44:48.06 Geoff you have no idea how excited I was that we went so heavy on knobs and track

00:44:52.08 one and that was not on the list I'm confused as to why Geoff thought we

00:44:55.07 weren't on track one yet like were you just

00:44:57.15 what were you what were you doing in the last episode just like trying not to

00:45:01.11 tell a story no no no I wasn't a part of andrew's album structure thing

00:45:05.22 he presented this to me last night or yesterday and we were he was just

00:45:10.00 talking about how see the way the way it went down is we

00:45:13.07 knew you were going to be taken off at some point nobody knew how long I had

00:45:17.14 had the conversation with you at dinner had an inkling Eric came to us and said

00:45:21.23 hey we need to schedule ahead gavin's going to be gone for a while and we said

00:45:25.12 like how much and he said probably as much as we can get and then Andrew came

00:45:29.10 up with 10 episodes and I got it in my head because he said I think we can

00:45:33.16 record 10 episodes in one week and Eric identified the first week of February as

00:45:37.19 a good time to do it so in my head those 10 episodes were their own thing today

00:45:42.09 does not comprise today is not the first week of February it is still January

00:45:46.10 20th or something so I was like I was considering that to

00:45:50.23 be something that we're gonna do uh you know 11 days from now right now I just

00:45:55.07 thought we were going to do our normal episode and then bang out an extra one

00:45:59.22 because we had the time and then we would be approaching uh the album of

00:46:04.10 content on that week much like we did hell week when you left to go film laser

00:46:09.00 team so many years ago an achievement hunter I just didn't think it had

00:46:12.09 started yet I think it'd be detrimental to do three in a day I agree I think

00:46:17.07 it's detrimental to do two in a day sometimes okay

00:46:20.11 so that's not true I I I that's not actually true I don't think that I don't

00:46:24.00 know why I said that that was like I don't know I actually

00:46:27.11 I actually [ __ ] I'm having more fun doing this episode than the last episode

00:46:30.19 I had a lot of fun doing the last episode and I recorded it and I recorded an

00:46:34.16 episode of annual pass 15 minutes before this so um this is my third episode

00:46:38.16 today and I'm having a blast well let me ask you Geoff how are the pleasantries

00:46:42.10 before annual pass [ __ I awesome awesome yeah dude that's a whole

00:46:46.23 different vibe there it's me and jack and ben and it's just like a big dude

00:46:52.09 bear hug it is just nothing but pleasantries it's a really easy way to

00:46:56.14 roll into a podcast that's also very warm and positive very different from us.

00:47:02.15 I think we can be both those things but rarely simultaneously yeah I agree I

00:47:07.12 agree I think we're very very great moments of warmth

00:47:11.12 is the donkey Kong bit is that a part of the album yeah that was on track one

00:47:16.17 that was track one okay that was okay so

00:47:19.01 we're bouncing around all right when are you gonna start that then I like it

00:47:22.04 why don't we start I don't know when this airs whenever this airs one week

00:47:25.09 from then okay one so it's going to come out the next episode uh

00:47:31.18 the results of it I guess would come out probably

00:47:35.09 later yeah one does when does this air what day is it right now for us well um

00:47:42.08 I'm waiting for Eric or nick yeah I'm waiting for somebody to tell this will

00:47:47.22 be February 9th February 9th okay what about yeah

00:47:50.12 episode 89 February 9th so not that weekend but the following weekend I will

00:47:56.12 start at Saturday 12 a.m and I have until

00:47:58.16 I have 40 hours from that point are you going to be doing commentary are you

00:48:02.06 going to be uh yeah I'll I'll do some I'll do some

00:48:05.03 commentary you're going to stream the whole thing of all yeah

00:48:08.19 we'll say I'll stream the whole thing maybe I won't do commentary necessarily

00:48:11.20 for all of it but I'll try to do for the most of it the bulk of it so I have a

00:48:15.13 question a couple years ago you did a thing but this is pre-podcast this is

00:48:20.00 pre-content at all you just did this to amuse yourself you did uh

00:48:24.13 a really fun really clever really cool thing that I was a big fan of where you

00:48:28.11 uh for a solid month you played uh not fortnite but the uh

00:48:32.20 pub g you played a player player unknowns battlegrounds uh and you only

00:48:37.23 ate real food in real life if you won the game and when you win the game it's

00:48:41.19 called winning a winner winner chicken dinner and so you were only allowed to

00:48:45.01 eat chicken but you could only eat chicken when you won a round of pub g so

00:48:49.15 if you played for 10 hours in a day and you didn't win a game you didn't eat

00:48:53.09 that day and I which I thought was brilliant and

00:48:55.17 really fun to watch and you actually ended uh the 30 days with a surplus of

00:49:00.12 food but I would have stopped to death yeah yeah no kidding right uh how

00:49:05.12 on the worst day on your toughest day in that how long do you think you played

00:49:10.16 and streamed because you streamed that entire thing too I did

00:49:15.03 uh well there were times where I would stream

00:49:18.15 thank you you just made me think of something else Geoff unrelated that but

00:49:21.23 if I didn't stream I'd screens hot the win I think the most I probably played

00:49:26.18 probably around eight hours I'd say once again that's the most I'd put in a day

00:49:30.02 so less than half of what you're gonna have to do here I'd assume so yeah that

00:49:34.21 was a constant maybe it was longer I don't know it's

00:49:37.12 hard to tell with time between sleeping and whatnot I would definitely stream

00:49:41.17 for like four hours three hours a night I'd say and then on weekends I'd

00:49:45.00 probably play a little bit during the day without streaming are there donkey

00:49:50.08 Kong 64 speed runs I'm sure there are but those would

00:49:53.03 involve using like cheats and skips that I would not yeah it's a pretty glitchy

00:49:57.11 game okay so you're playing your goal is to

00:50:00.04 play it legitimately and not that's not how you're gonna you'll find a different

00:50:03.10 way to cheat I'm not gonna cheat I didn't cheat the halo bat if anything

00:50:08.02 Gavin was worth cheating the halo bet then I had to copy his cheats

00:50:13.14 not really cheat well you're using what is cheating if me using skulls it wait

00:50:20.00 can I get the audio isolated of Andrew saying I'm not going to cheat followed

00:50:24.20 up by what is cheap that'd be great thank you

00:50:30.00 you brought up a moment ago Geoff me streaming it and made me think of the

00:50:35.07 fact well when I wasn't streaming I would screens hot my wins

00:50:39.17 I think Gavin may have and I don't I don't know this to be true but I think

00:50:44.13 Gavin may have pulled off the greatest troll move against me anyone ever has

00:50:49.18 I think it's highly possible and if if you have

00:50:53.14 I want to applaud you Gavin because it was a great

00:50:56.19 it was a great move as part of as we discussed this album structure of ideas

00:51:02.12 as last night I was like I need to think of more content whenever Gavin and I

00:51:07.19 play halo right now he does a thing where

00:51:11.05 we try to get more kills than each other and I typically will have more than he

00:51:14.19 does but if there's a game where he has more kills than me

00:51:18.03 he'll call out that he's doing that he is and that he screen shots the screen

00:51:23.14 whenever we play this has gone on for weeks now

00:51:26.12 and he'll say it he'll typically wait until he won't bring attention to it

00:51:30.07 until there's maybe like nine or ten kills left in a game and then he'll be

00:51:34.14 like ah screens hot game and then I it will become intense and I will try to

00:51:38.12 win and I most of the time don't ends with me disappointedly yelling we've had

00:51:42.16 some close screens hot games where I've almost come back

00:51:45.12 well cause Andrew most we mostly just play very casually we're not playing

00:51:48.18 ranked half the time we're just playing like fiesta or something very casual so

00:51:52.02 we're just like shooting the [ __ ] half

00:51:54.06 the game and if I notice towards the end that I'm doing better I'll mention it

00:51:57.16 and then Andrew just goes basically silent as he tries to concentrate on

00:52:02.02 that stuff it becomes very competitive and then I've had this joke where I'm

00:52:06.04 gonna buy Gavin a photo album and when he has enough screen shots to fill the

00:52:10.21 photo album I'll there will be like a prize or something as a gag so last night

00:52:16.02 I decided I was like well I wonder we've been playing for quite a few weeks now

00:52:19.20 there have been plenty of screens hot games how many screen shots has Gavin

00:52:24.09 taken and so I checked your thing and I I there there was there was not a single

00:52:30.00 screens hot there and I had never considered the possibility

00:52:33.12 that you just say screens hot without screenshotting Davin have you taken have

00:52:39.03 you taken a single screens hot trigger screens hot game I took one you took one

00:52:46.10 that's great it's a fantastic troll I have been the the sweatiness of these

00:52:53.09 games screens hot game I haven't known how quickly you figured out that I wasn't

00:52:58.19 taking them oh I was going to do that for so long all right well here's the

00:53:03.16 thing you could have had an out and I'm glad I didn't set it up this way that

00:53:08.10 information is private on your account I can't see it so I wasn't sure if

00:53:13.12 you had flipped it to private prior to the screens hot thing and that's why they

00:53:19.01 weren't there so there was room for you to to continue this

00:53:22.03 no but I looked at that one I took was the one I sent you where I'd I guess I'd

00:53:25.22 only half held down the back button or I'd let go too soon but it's like a very

00:53:30.02 transparent version of the scoreboard like I messed up the screens hot it's

00:53:33.12 funny because I think I've taken one screens hot myself and I couldn't figure

00:53:37.16 out how you did it because it was like it looks shitty like there's not a post

00:53:41.16 game screen but I had never thought and then last night it was like the scene

00:53:45.13 and the usual the slowly dropping the coffee cup when he has the realization I

00:53:50.15 was like I wonder how many screen shots oh no is this all a lie

00:53:57.14 yeah I just didn't want to clog up my feet

00:54:02.13 clog up the feed nobody could see well I could have to scroll through it

00:54:07.19 one day you know what I started today Gavin feeling bad that

00:54:12.00 Geoff is [ __ ] with you with you always being in a bad mood I no longer feel bad

00:54:17.21 Geoff has this bad mood you have your screens hot he is in a bad mood sometimes

00:54:22.12 though I only I like sometimes he's not but sometimes he's it's pretty

00:54:25.17 noticeable and you're like maybe just because I know him so well but it's like

00:54:28.19 goddamn dude what do you think people don't get in a bad mood yeah but

00:54:33.17 everyone has like a gamey day where they didn't sleep well it's comedy you know

00:54:39.01 but all comedy has a grain of truth in it right and the reality is that more

00:54:42.22 often than not you're in a gammy mood we need to get you a new bed and a new

00:54:47.11 door I'm trying to do all these I'm trying to

00:54:49.22 make myself sleep better I'm trying to lock people out I'm trying to you know

00:54:53.12 fingerprint the door handles and all that I'm trying to I'm trying to make

00:54:57.20 myself less tired but I would say I would say like

00:55:01.12 95 percent of the time I'm solid yeah well I think everybody else might come

00:55:06.07 up with a different ratio but it's cool that you think that what about you

00:55:09.14 Andrew do you think I'm in a bad mood sometimes no only once there's only one

00:55:13.14 time where it felt genuine I don't know that that no wasn't super enthusia

00:55:18.06 believable there you went we can't do that we're going to

00:55:21.06 take away the entire English language from Geoff if we start calling out every

00:55:25.22 word he's already lost o that's honestly when if I feel like I'm

00:55:30.10 genuinely in a bit of a flat mood I just try and avoid people in general is that

00:55:35.20 why I never talk to you

00:55:39.07 no that tracks that makes a lot of sense that's why

00:55:43.17 we never communicate like if I'm feeling really tired and a bunch of people

00:55:47.01 hanging out I I would much prefer not to go I just

00:55:49.11 don't like being around people when I'm tired because I just feel like I'm not

00:55:52.21 being very funny or I'm just being boring and it's just like I'm

00:55:55.22 everyone's gonna be in in a better place if I'm if I'm just gonna go to sleep

00:55:58.21 early or something yeah the way the world would be a much better place

00:56:02.08 without you yeah yeah let's see what you're saying [Music]

00:56:06.06 wait Andrew what was the one time was in a bad mood

00:56:10.02 I don't remember the context of it but

00:56:12.15 Geoff said it I think to [ __ ] with you it

00:56:14.23 was like the third time he had done it but it seemed genuine

00:56:19.07 and that's what made it funny it is funny that he [ __ ] with you and that

00:56:24.12 you don't know how to react to it but when you're actually in a bad mood it

00:56:29.14 makes your way funnier the problem is the problem for you Gavin

00:56:34.10 is that I'm some sometimes I'm kidding sometimes

00:56:39.09 that's all sometimes I'm not sometimes you are legitimately and I may be the

00:56:43.13 old maybe it's because we lived together

00:56:46.04 for so long and maybe I'm the I just I'm

00:56:48.00 I can I just know you that well uh but I uh sometimes I'm definitely not kidding

00:56:53.03 and I I guess you'll just never know I feel like you're maybe attributing

00:56:58.22 just generic tiredness to actually being in a bad mood like a lot of the time I

00:57:02.19 am like a little bit lethargic I know tired lethargic Gavin we made red versus

00:57:06.18 blue together I remember those long days

00:57:09.20 I know I know I've seen you fall so much you're so tired that's true

00:57:15.01 so here's my idea for the infinity pie okay all right I just realized I never

00:57:20.17 got to it and then yeah it's a good moment but I'm crowbar

00:57:24.15 into it okay so we had the I had the idea or I think actually maybe you had

00:57:29.03 the idea Andrew I don't want to steal it or somehow some an idea was formed at

00:57:33.03 some point in the past through some uh combination of this podcast just any

00:57:38.04 idea where we wanted to make the infinity towel right we wanted to take

00:57:41.09 all the little pieces of relics of nba players and make a super towel that's

00:57:45.18 got LeBron James and Kobe Bryant and you know Jason Tatum and

00:57:50.10 Joel embiid and did you say that'd be a funny

00:57:54.02 funny visual and just to be clear not actual full team type we've asked people

00:57:57.12 to send in towel cart just to be careful it's just a little snippet of it um and

00:58:02.07 by the way people have been sending stuff in I wouldn't check the mail

00:58:06.02 yesterday or today and I had a bunch of uh baseball cards that people have sent

00:58:09.05 in not baseball cards but like different

00:58:11.09 kinds of wild trading cards so we'll try to open those up on a break show that

00:58:14.16 already happened at this point uh so uh so if you watched that you saw the cards

00:58:19.18 you know what they are anyway I was thinking the other night was ordering

00:58:24.13 pizza and I had this problem in my house where I like Hawaiian pizza I like a

00:58:29.14 Hawaiian pie and I like a like a fiery Hawaiian pizza

00:58:32.08 but I don't like it an entire pizza worth and my girlfriend and my daughter

00:58:36.05 are not big fans so I don't ever want to order like a whole Hawaiian pie for

00:58:40.23 myself because I genuinely generally just want one piece

00:58:44.09 and then they want to get like a margarita or a pepperoni or whatever and

00:58:48.07 then I thought about it they should make a pizza called the infinity pie where

00:58:52.20 it's eight slices and each slice is a different pizza so you get a taste of

00:58:57.11 all the different kind of pizzas at once without having to order too much pizza

00:59:02.12 or just in my case go without ever having a Hawaiian pizza because I would

00:59:06.11 be left with six slices I wouldn't eat an infinity pie I think that would do so

00:59:11.12 well if pizza hut or domino's or one of those chains created it and it's like

00:59:14.20 here's your pepperoni slice here's your Hawaiian slice here's your veggie slice

00:59:18.17 here's your gluten-free slice here's your meat extravaganza slice here's your

00:59:23.09 double pep or whatever always end up with a pizza box with just one slice of

00:59:28.04 anchovy left in it well yeah I mean maybe or maybe people

00:59:31.11 would be like well there's only one left

00:59:33.20 I'm going to learn to like anchovies and then they oh

00:59:36.08 little caesars makes this little she just makes this it's called the quattro

00:59:40.04 pizza wow it's called the what is it called

00:59:42.23 it's called a cuatro I believe all right I've never I don't see a Hawaiian pizza

00:59:48.02 on that can you pick it's not in there for no I don't know if you pick it's a

00:59:52.02 great can you pick the four Eric is saying that it was like the first

00:59:55.02 episode of uh no you don't pick the four it's just four yeah see that's the

00:59:58.10 problem I would want to be able to pick and four is not enough I would want to

01:00:02.08 that's not infinity to me that's quite I don't I don't hang on hang on hang on

01:00:05.14 hang on yeah infinity is eight four

01:00:08.06 you want a pizza where every single slice is different

01:00:12.06 I think so yes but it's still one pizza no I understand that it's what yeah no I

01:00:17.22 get that I'm saying that but you want every single slice to be different I

01:00:22.19 think so you want one slice one individual that seems

01:00:27.04 an a tipped over is infinity yeah see like turn it sideways

01:00:31.12 kick it kick an eight as if it's a small Canadian kid and it becomes an infiniti

01:00:37.18 let's let's just very quickly there's a crying infinity sign let's throw out a

01:00:43.01 scenario Geoff you we're at your place there's a group of people gavin's there

01:00:47.22 a bunch of people are there and you let it known to the party that you have

01:00:51.23 ordered your infinity pizza I am rushing to that [ __ ] box like

01:00:56.14 it's the beginning of the hunger games if there's only one slice of each type

01:01:02.08 I I need like it's gonna be [ __ ]

01:01:02.08 chaos it's just gonna be a sprint it'll be like the xfl where they just put the

01:01:06.20 ball in the middle of the field everybody ran to it for the kickoff

01:01:11.05 everyone's going to be storming that pizza box

01:01:13.23 somebody who's a storm chaser I will get there first what you're saying is it's

01:01:19.12 creating enthusiasm around the food I like it no

01:01:22.02 no it's you're creating false scarcity so I'm gonna have to [ __ ] elbow two

01:01:25.21 people I like to make sure I get pepperoni you just imagine a big party full of

01:01:30.07 [ __ ] loads of people and then someone's like I know what we're gonna do we're

01:01:33.16 gonna get eight infinity pizzas yeah that's eight slices for it oh maybe

01:01:38.17 we should have just got eight normal pizzas [Laughter]

01:01:42.13 I never never describe scarcity as creating

01:01:45.16 enthusiasm ever again place it is it's a terrible thing

01:01:49.07 creating enthusiasm I wanna say you get a slice of cheese you get a slice of pep

01:01:53.15 you get a slice of mushroom and pep you get a slice of veg you get a slice

01:01:58.00 that's exciting if I'm the only one eating the pizza

01:02:01.20 how often are you having parties how often are you partying how many times

01:02:05.09 how old uh let me ask you a question how

01:02:07.22 on a scale of like how many out of every 10 times you order a pizza is it for a

01:02:11.19 party or is it for you or you and like one other person because for me it's 10

01:02:16.12 out of 10 times I'm getting a pizza for me my girlfriend and my daughter not the

01:02:22.19 whole [ __ ] world so much pizza murder I mean I would assume the rules anytime

01:02:28.04 you're ordering for in mass the rules of ordering change I also wouldn't ever

01:02:32.03 order like a tray of a hundred nuggets uh for myself but if I'm having people

01:02:37.12 over here I'll do that what's the maximum capacity for the quad pizza and

01:02:41.11 the infinity pizza in your mind eight no that's way too many people how many

01:02:46.13 slices oh eight people I'm sorry how many slices how many people yes

01:02:49.23 uh I would say if I could do a pizza party I got one

01:02:53.10 slice of pizza I'm fine I would say four every everybody gets two everybody gets

01:02:58.13 two slices two slices no that's you need it I no that doesn't

01:03:02.23 I'm not gonna eat more than two pieces of pizza

01:03:05.11 then I'm okay if you I would say three and if you're part of the three and

01:03:08.20 you're only eating two then I'm okay with it then three but I'm okay with

01:03:12.07 every Eric says not the slices it's the choices I'm okay with every choice on

01:03:15.16 the pie well then what are all the choices I mean let's see cheese pepperoni

01:03:23.07 mushroom pep veg Hawaiian uh deluxe meat lovers and margarita

01:03:36.06 it adds a little bit of variety because you're like oh what am I gonna get

01:03:41.12 what's left in the box what am I gonna have you don't actually know you know

01:03:44.23 it's going to be something you like but you don't know which one I would say it

01:03:49.01 enhances those I've got to say it enhances that slice makes it taste even

01:03:53.05 better so you're going to keep a tomato base across the entire pizza uh

01:03:57.09 for this infinity pie yeah I'm sure I'm assuming that there's other options what

01:04:01.13 if what if I told you that uh one of the slices has the p word on it

01:04:06.04 you're creating the scenario in which every slice is something that you like

01:04:10.21 and a scenario in which you don't like every slice I would say that uh I would

01:04:15.18 say first off that's ludicrous how often

01:04:17.16 have you seen a pizza with the p word on

01:04:19.13 it but I would also say I just described

01:04:21.16 probably the eight most common slices of pizza out there I don't think I'm

01:04:24.23 stretching or going for weird ingredients I'm just going for like the

01:04:28.21 pizzas that you mostly see out in the world in the wild that's fair

01:04:33.18 I just don't as somebody as somebody who doesn't love every slice

01:04:37.04 of pizza I'm pretty I'm pretty cornered so which which out of those eight that I

01:04:42.08 said which one wouldn't you eat I I'm not a big fan of sausage on pizza

01:04:47.08 don't like it I wouldn't touch an olive

01:04:50.00 yeah all of if there's an olive on there I'm out sometimes

01:04:54.13 I can enjoy a red onion on a pizza I mainly stick within the camps of like

01:05:00.02 I'm either gonna have a barbecue chicken pizza or like a pepperoni pizza those

01:05:04.12 are my teammates and see I feel like barbecue chicken would be a bridge too

01:05:10.08 far in my infinity pie I think that's a little bit more of a niche

01:05:14.15 slice of pizza but I I do enjoy a barbecue chicken pizza for sure I like a

01:05:19.16 Hawaiian but I swap out the ham with pepperoni so if I could poach

01:05:24.12 some of your pineapple from your Hawaiian slice

01:05:28.09 I still I think this is a terrible idea terrible idea terrible I would say

01:05:32.21 terrible terrible I'd go as far as thing terrible yeah unless I'm ordering for

01:05:37.00 myself and I can pick all the slices in which case I'm probably just doing a

01:05:40.13 half and half yeah I guess I I I think it I think it

01:05:44.10 would revolutionize pizza I think that's little caesars was on to something they

01:05:48.21 just didn't take it far enough I think it would be you you have me back on

01:05:52.11 board if it's all the crust varieties all the topping varieties all the sauce

01:05:57.16 varieties and you don't know what you're buying [Laughter]

01:06:02.21 and it's like the different brands like you know how like dominoes their flat

01:06:08.19 crust is like a [ __ ] cracker each like how they cut it like if there's

01:06:13.16 more of a franken pizza like you're describing what's called the infinite

01:06:16.22 mystery pizza I love that too I'm in for that that sounds great but

01:06:21.20 just one slice of everything they're all

01:06:25.22 the same outside of just topping variety that's the tougher sell for me uh

01:06:30.10 what about that bread clip right yeah what about that breakfast I wouldn't buy

01:06:36.12 just pizza but I would buy a glorious tiki mug that looked like a port a potty

01:06:41.12 oh he had a week ago if you if you go to our website uh to

01:06:45.07 our store store.roost.com and then you look up in the face section

01:06:49.23 and you see a pink port a potty tiki mug and it's still for sale we have a

01:06:54.17 problem please please please buy it please please for god's sakes

01:07:00.12 is that would that be our second flop after the they'll never after the

01:07:05.07 skateboard they're never gonna let us make anything again if we if we fail on

01:07:10.13 these we should just maintain a page on the store called the face flops and

01:07:22.00 dude speaking of flops uh one of the things

01:07:26.10 I know we gotta I know we gotta end the show I know we got eric's yelling at me

01:07:31.11 uh we had a conversation that we were all

01:07:33.13 playing video games together and I was asking you guys what your favorite candy

01:07:36.22 or sweet was and then uh you guys gave me your answers and so I bought them and

01:07:41.03 I meant to tell you guys to do the same thing and then I thought we could all

01:07:45.01 try each other's favorite candies on air and have like a little candy taste test

01:07:49.16 uh but in the process of buying some and I'm still waiting for Andrews

01:07:53.04 to show up I discovered you know I don't know if you know I'm a

01:07:56.18 huge laffy taffy fan I'm a big banana laffy taffy fan and I was at the store

01:08:02.00 buying some candy some of this candy last night and I saw that there's this

01:08:07.01 thing called laffy taffy candy laugh bites and it's all banana it's called

01:08:11.00 gone bananas and it's just like I don't know it's like a different kind

01:08:14.17 of candy but it's laffy taffy brand and so I got the idea that it was like

01:08:18.03 basically like if if you like if you want those people who loves banana runs

01:08:21.02 like I do you just want banana runs and if you can just buy banana runs you do

01:08:24.12 so I bought this thinking that I was gonna get some [ __ ] just a bunch of

01:08:29.09 yummy ass banana laffy taffy this sucks this was such a misstep for the laffy

01:08:34.13 taffy brand it is so unfun to eat and it's so bland I can't believe they have

01:08:39.17 they have yellow banana gold in their grasp and they turned it into

01:08:45.03 this I just just so disappointed that's all

01:08:48.06 just had to register my frustration so what is it called sorry laffy taffy

01:08:53.07 candy laugh bites gone I will see if I can find it because I don't

01:08:58.04 you wouldn't be disappointed but I don't

01:09:01.11 like bass laffy taffy so maybe this will

01:09:04.04 be maybe I'll enjoy this more bass laffy taffy is good so we're doing the candy
