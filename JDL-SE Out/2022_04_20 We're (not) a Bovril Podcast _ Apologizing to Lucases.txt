00:00:10.02 doozy we talk about lactating women we talk we talk about all sorts of things

00:00:13.07 but what the thing I'm here to talk to you about is we're selling the baseballs

00:00:17.11 that are coming out on Friday on store.roosterteeth.com they will sell

00:00:21.18 out very quickly but I realize we never talked about them on the show we've only

00:00:25.14 mentioned it on social media uh if you want to follow us on social media we

00:00:30.13 have an Instagram account at facepod I believe in a twitter account with I

00:00:34.02 think the same name at facepod I also have YouTube you can find that out there

00:00:39.18 anyway thank you bye baseball previously on face.

00:00:43.12 [Music]

00:00:50.15 Hello and welcome to another episode of the F**kFuckFacePodcast this is number 99. We

00:00:56.19 are in season four still year two I believe

00:01:01.01 really closing in on that episode 100.

00:01:03.22 We are moments away with me as always Andrew panton and

00:01:08.21 Gavin free how's it going [ __ ] I I'd say it's going well I'm

00:01:14.10 still thinking about bovrel because we just recorded that one I'm sure

00:01:18.16 everybody else who's listening is equally haunted by it and it has stuck

00:01:22.05 with them maybe some have tried it I did

00:01:24.07 not need to know that [ __ ] existed that was whoa I think you'd be surprised

00:01:29.03 at how good it is what like I was surprised it exists I'm

00:01:32.21 already surprised yeah hard to get more surprises bad it's not bad

00:01:37.05 if anything Geoff you should you'll probably like it because the opposite of

00:01:40.15 the color you hate yeah I guess that's true that is true that's fair that is

00:01:44.11 true uh and I mean there's a whole bottle industry

00:01:47.16 right so clearly there's a market for it the bottle industry

00:01:52.19 you're not wrong but it's just it's it's a weird thing I wonder what the annual

00:01:58.08 above real industry was worth yeah like what

00:02:02.04 what are the global barrel sales for 2021

00:02:06.21 uh I'm gonna Google that real fast do you guys talk I'm gonna Google that.

00:02:11.14 [Applause]

00:02:12.20 Global bav roll sales for 2021

00:02:16.23 higher or lower than salad cream do you think Gavin oh lower

00:02:21.07 lower not as popular okay I have no point of reference for these things so

00:02:26.08 it's interesting to hear Christ this is what Google returned

00:02:31.06 by 1968 the boverl empire owned argentinian beef ranches that

00:02:35.05 totaled the equivalent of half the size of england production was also moved

00:02:41.01 from London to its current home in Burton on Trent today bovrel is as

00:02:45.19 popular as ever providing three and a half million jars to brits every year

00:02:51.03 so they were just liquefying argentinian

00:02:54.12 cows is that what you're saying seems to be the case

00:02:58.06 they must have like a big bottle grinder and they just push the cows in and then

00:03:03.09 out comes the juice we're above real podcast

00:03:06.23 oh [ __ ] dude in 2004 bovrel drops the beef to go vegetarian

00:03:12.10 they didn't do that I mean wouldn't that just be mama or vegemite I don't know

00:03:18.03 let me look into the bottle Wikipedia oh god uh recipe changes okay here we go

00:03:23.17 it was promoted as a super food in the early 20th century

00:03:27.09 uh advertisements for bovrel recommended

00:03:29.07 people dilute it into a tea or spread it on their morning toast disgusting some

00:03:32.19 adverts even claim the bottle could protect one from influenza since its

00:03:36.16 invention bottles become an icon of British culture and it is associated

00:03:40.15 with football culture so you were right there Gavin during the winter bover

00:03:44.08 football fans and stadiums terraces drink it as a tea from thermos flasks or

00:03:49.18 from disposable cups uh in Scotland where thermoses are banned no [ __ ]

00:03:54.13 thermoses in in Scotland uh no doorknobs in Vancouver no services

00:03:58.17 what's interesting is the prevention of influenza is also what they said about

00:04:02.14 butt plugs so really this circles in multiple ways I thought that was night

00:04:06.08 blindness it's everything the butt plug is originally cured all right

00:04:11.11 in 2004 unilever which is very close to uniform

00:04:15.12 uh remove the beef ingredients from bovrel rendering it vegetarian this was

00:04:19.16 mainly due to concerns about decreasing sales particularly from exports due to

00:04:24.03 an export ban on British beef as a result of that growing popularity

00:04:29.05 of vegetarianism religious dietary uh requirements and

00:04:33.00 public concerns about well about [ __ ]

00:04:35.21 mad cow disease uh in 2006 unilever reversed that [ __ ] excuse me I burped

00:04:41.18 in 2006 unilever reversed that decision and introduced or reintroduced beef back

00:04:47.21 to the bottle formula once sales increased and the export bans were

00:04:53.07 lifted unilever now produces bottle using beef extract and a chicken variety

00:04:56.21 using chicken extract we should try all the bottles like what's better the

00:05:00.21 veggie one or the beef or the chicken like a cosmic crisp review yeah do you

00:05:06.13 know who the forest green rovers football club is Gavin no

00:05:10.01 I don't either there but I assume that there was British uh in November 2020

00:05:15.01 they announced a collaboration with the makers of barrel to create a beat

00:05:19.06 version b-e-e-t version of barrel to be sold in the new lawn stadium where

00:05:23.12 meat-based products had been removed exclusive you would've thought the mad

00:05:28.21 cow had a knock-on effect on all the like yeah I guess makes total sense yeah

00:05:33.02 I can't give blood here because of that because you have mad cows yeah they

00:05:38.00 don't want my filthy British blood in their banks because of mad cow I can't

00:05:43.03 give blood anymore because I have too many tattoos I was told oh wow

00:05:48.01 Andrew can you give blood I I should really try it's actually a thing I've

00:05:51.10 been meaning to look into there's a rally for it happening in the near

00:05:54.11 future where I live and I was gonna I was gonna look into that I've never

00:05:59.12 tried I don't know why I'd be rejected although could it be a weird

00:06:02.17 do you have to have like oh blood like do you have to in any blood acceptable

00:06:08.04 well sometimes more valuable than others but for sure but yeah because I know

00:06:13.05 all blood is good I imagine it's like a different I feel

00:06:16.06 like I've heard when you try to like going to a sperm bank you have to

00:06:20.13 hit a lot of requirements like to get approved for that I feel

00:06:24.10 like the requirements are very stringent from what I've heard well how do they

00:06:28.03 know though before you monk off into a cup how do they know if you qualify well

00:06:32.06 I think you have to go through some things and then I think maybe I don't I

00:06:35.06 don't know the process of it from my understanding you need to you need to

00:06:38.15 essentially have like super I don't I mean I don't want to further

00:06:42.17 make this harder to get sponsored a junior hockey team but it's from what

00:06:47.14 I've heard you need essentially super [ __ ] to get approved from a sperm bank

00:06:53.00 that's just what I've heard.

00:06:55.09 I don't know how any of that work I don't know I think I think I think

00:06:59.05 you're right Andrew they're they're they

00:07:01.16 don't want scrub sperm they want to make sure it's genetically good that you're

00:07:05.09 not like predisposed to have like four million different issues and then also I

00:07:08.19 think most of those places fill out a form and they well I think they

00:07:12.21 maybe they can get data from the the sample I don't know

00:07:16.13 like if maybe it's a doctor's thing but you need to be clear like you need to

00:07:20.15 have a really good medical history and maybe

00:07:24.15 maybe potency maybe it's sperm count like I think there are multiple layers

00:07:28.20 so it's all decided after the after the specimen yes it's not pre I think you

00:07:33.06 can do a pre-interview I'm sure there's like some medicals that you go through

00:07:37.00 but I think it's post sample that's what I'm trying to remember I

00:07:40.14 feel like I heard a story where somebody like wanted to do that because they'd

00:07:44.04 get paid for it and then they went through the whole process that they're

00:07:47.06 told that they weren't good enough I think they also have like

00:07:50.21 like requirements too like you have to have a college degree and uh

00:07:55.09 like seriously like they don't want like the [ __ ] dumbs really yeah yeah

00:07:59.06 that's interesting yeah but just does my knowledge get passed down in my sperm

00:08:03.03 what the hell does that even mean I don't know it's like a third they want

00:08:08.11 thoroughbreds only Gavin they need to it needs to be a high quality

00:08:14.05 passing down knowledge to my jizz uh how using donor sperm works donor

00:08:19.07 evaluation the health and safety of donors and recipients are paramount to

00:08:23.11 the donation process donors must be under 40 free of communicable diseases

00:08:29.03 and without a family history of genetic disorder they do a semen analysis to

00:08:33.10 determine its usability it must be able to withstand freezing storage and

00:08:38.10 thawing while remaining viable before using the sperm it needs to

00:08:42.15 undergo quarantine in frozen storage for at least

00:08:45.03 six months the donor must again test negative for communicable diseases after

00:08:49.10 the six-month quarantine period before the sperm is available for use sperm

00:08:53.14 bakes offer anonymous information about donors including interests appetite

00:08:57.09 aptitudes and physical characteristics parents can also use a known donor or

00:09:00.22 someone they know sperm bank donors remain anonymous throughout the process

00:09:04.10 however known donors do not so I'm right I just said it horribly but

00:09:09.05 I was correct I didn't know any of the information the specifics

00:09:14.04 but I was I was in the right direction um as I'm trying to think of like

00:09:18.06 how I mean I already said super [ __ ]

00:09:20.19 we're already pretty pretty low low tier as far as sponsoring

00:09:24.08 junior hockey goes I had I had another great conversation with my mom recently

00:09:29.08 oh is there an update there is an update

00:09:32.06 this isn't this isn't about buttplugs um this is uh I talked to my mom about um

00:09:38.13 lactating lactating women kinks was the conversation because it was a

00:09:44.02 subreddit there's a subreddit post where I live

00:09:47.18 lactating women cakes yes there's somebody that they use the milk from

00:09:52.23 tits I don't I don't know what they do with it it was a post on the subreddit

00:09:59.14 and it was somebody who would be like hey I don't I'm trying to and it wasn't

00:10:04.12 this person was very serious I have a lactating woman kink does

00:10:08.05 anybody know of any ways that I could I could figure this out type thing how I

00:10:12.12 could how I could solve this issue so so what what is solve what like how do I

00:10:16.13 get access to women who how do I get access to lactating women was

00:10:21.09 essentially the post okay I would say it was very odd it was a

00:10:24.18 strange it's one of the stranger posts I've seen this is verging on like black

00:10:30.05 market [ __ ] but it wasn't it wasn't like

00:10:33.09 negative and that way it was just like hey are there

00:10:36.17 services that I could I don't know I guess I guess your best bet would be to

00:10:40.04 hang out at the prenatal ward in a hospital I mean that's what you'd hoped

00:10:44.01 for yeah what what made me laugh I should have told this the other way

00:10:48.06 before previous my post favorite or or the post I enjoyed

00:10:51.10 the most that was on subreddit before was somebody posted this thing saying

00:10:56.13 every night downtown we have a get-together from 7pm until like 10 p.m

00:11:01.08 come hang out if you want to and it was just a video of dudes twirling fire

00:11:05.14 sticks and like this little gazebo with like

00:11:09.06 spencer's gifts type lights just shining around them I was like this is what a

00:11:13.10 [ __ ] weird thing that'd be to walk into and then I looked at I clicked the

00:11:18.10 post and the top comment was alcohol and 420 friendly like there

00:11:22.19 would need to be a clarification that the fire stick twirlers

00:11:26.00 sponsored gifts like it was one of the funniest clarifications I've ever seen

00:11:30.15 like somebody be like oh I hope they'd be okay with this so

00:11:34.00 then I learned that the person that made that post was the lactating milk guy

00:11:37.23 because I went into their post history because I'm like what else is in here if

00:11:41.11 that's there there has to be some wild [ __ ] in their post history and I found

00:11:46.08 that and I was very excited it was the same guy

00:11:48.14 so then I thought ah this is a funny it's a funny thing I was going to tell

00:11:51.20 my mom about it so it's talking about the the fire thing and I was like yeah

00:11:57.01 it said on the the post that they're alcohol and 420 friendly and my mom had

00:12:02.17 no idea what 420 was like she had never heard of 420.

00:12:05.19 And so then I had to explain what 420

00:12:08.11 was but my initial thought was she's gonna have no clue

00:12:13.00 what a lactating woman kink is if we're if the 420 is the barrier of entry

00:12:18.10 then have to explain that so then I explain that to my mom and

00:12:22.20 uh what what's wrong Eric Eric's having a breakdown in the chat I can't I can't

00:12:28.08 believe that lactating woman kink is the long walk that we just took to

00:12:33.03 explaining to your mom what 420 what was part of the same thing I thought it

00:12:38.06 was a funny thing right because I thought

00:12:42.08 to go so insane at the beginning to dial it all the way back to well mom 420

00:12:48.08 means weed is like no you're right wild you're totally right.

00:12:55.03 I [ __ ] up I told the story in the wrong order 100

00:12:58.23 that's my fault um well it is your redemption here you

00:13:03.09 want to start over no no we're good we could just we move past it but I just it

00:13:07.01 was more funny to me that I was like I wonder if she knows what this is

00:13:10.14 considering she didn't know the butt plug thing was where my mind was at and

00:13:13.15 seeing her reaction to it I thought would be funny she didn't even know what

00:13:16.21 420 was so there's a hurdle to clear there she

00:13:20.00 had no idea she did she was disgusted equally with the butt plugs as the

00:13:23.07 lactating woman doesn't understand any of it

00:13:26.17 she paused there was like a moment of processing and then was like I wonder

00:13:31.06 I wonder if he likes sugar cookies is all she said and then we never addressed

00:13:36.15 it again so I think in her head it's like a consumption

00:13:39.10 it's a consumption thing I don't think she understands what the kink is does

00:13:43.08 your mom think breast milk tastes like sugar cookies does breast milk taste

00:13:46.23 like sugar cookies I think she was thinking her brain I think went like I

00:13:51.01 wonder if he would have it in cookies and then it went to sugar cookie I don't

00:13:55.01 know I can't explain why her brain went there but it was a very funny thing of

00:13:58.12 she was stunned didn't really know what to say we were both quiet for a minute

00:14:03.05 and then she just said that and we moved on just moved on from it

00:14:08.10 we just moved on there's no other that was

00:14:11.15 there have been some weird it's not the most awkward

00:14:15.18 have you seen like a movie with your parents there's like a

00:14:20.17 that's an I regret that that was yeah like that was awkward got a lifetime an

00:14:24.18 entire lifetime of that experience it could be what's the worst one you've had

00:14:28.04 because I feel like I have an awesome bad one I had one recently not well

00:14:31.20 recently it was about 10 years ago um I went home to Alabama because my dad died

00:14:37.09 and so uh it was like the week my dad died I

00:14:40.15 was just trying to laugh and so I put on an episode of it's always sunny in

00:14:46.01 Philadelphia and my mom sat down to watch it with me and it was the episode

00:14:50.18 where they faked the death of a small child to get away from the irs and they

00:14:55.08 had a I don't remember what it was some dead animal in a coffin and they flipped

00:14:59.11 the coffin over and the dead animal fell out and I just looked at my mom and I

00:15:02.14 was like this was not the time for this [ __ ] episode

00:15:08.04 yeah it was a real mood killer real moon

00:15:13.18 that's so bad okay your turn well do you have one Gavin uh despite watching

00:15:18.13 uncomfortable stuff I remember um I watched titanic as a child

00:15:23.01 there's that bit where they're shagging in the car like in the cargo area

00:15:28.08 it'll come up all sweaty there's like steam on the windows and I remember when

00:15:32.15 I was a kid just asking my parents I was like what

00:15:35.21 happened why they were wet and uh my mum was like they went swimming

00:15:40.12 before this scene and I was like okay and then it was like

00:15:45.02 15 years later I watched it again I was like

00:15:48.04 wait a second like I didn't I didn't ever put it together in the meantime

00:15:51.13 that uh they were just shagging in a car and they lied to me I just assumed it

00:15:55.12 might burn in to my brain wrong that they actually went for a swim I was like

00:16:00.21 wait there was no pool my worst one this is so bad so I I my mom and I would

00:16:06.01 go to the movies all the time it was like one of our main bonding things that

00:16:10.00 we used to do quite a bit and so we'd see everything

00:16:13.11 anything that looked good we would go see and one of the movies we saw together

00:16:18.19 was don john and I don't know how familiar either

00:16:21.21 of you are with don john it was a Joseph Gordon-levitt movie I believe he wrote

00:16:26.21 and directed it as well and it's about a guy that is struggling

00:16:30.10 with a porn addiction and so it's like obviously it's gonna touch on that

00:16:35.03 subject matter the opening the opening to don john is just straight

00:16:39.14 up pornography just like snippets and scenes from just

00:16:42.12 like they pulled from pornhub or whatever it's like legit horn in it and

00:16:46.19 so I'm like watching I'm preparing got the popcorn ready it's like ah there's

00:16:50.05 probably going to be some awkward sex stuff in this but and you're with me

00:16:54.12 and I'm with my mom yeah like I just it's like we can get

00:16:57.06 over it's whatever it's a movie it's none of that whatever we could get

00:17:00.19 through this and it opens with porn just straight up porn and it was the most

00:17:05.14 uncomfortable movie experience I've ever had there was

00:17:09.04 like no it was zero story you couldn't just like get into some parts of it it

00:17:14.17 was just porn immediately did you write the intro looking at the screen

00:17:19.04 000 yard stare forward I'm in a space up

00:17:21.23 by myself nobody else is in this room it

00:17:24.12 was terrible it was I wanted to die what was your mom's reaction I don't know I

00:17:28.17 couldn't tell you I was looking forward it was just we never talked about it we

00:17:32.04 like just talked about the movie as a whole outside of that but it was very

00:17:37.11 uncomfortable I like that from from our conversations I know that there

00:17:41.11 was no butt plugs in that pawn

00:17:43.22 or breast milk it's a good movie but it was like the

00:17:48.15 most awkward viewing experience I've had and I never thought that I'd be in a

00:17:53.23 scenario in like a movie theater just watching porn

00:17:58.05 it was a curve ball I have another one uh

00:18:00.21 that I will remember until the day I die I was in high school and I was this is

00:18:05.15 when I got really into music when I was about 14 I discovered punk and I got

00:18:09.11 like hard into music and it's all I cared about and I was really into this

00:18:13.04 band in the 90s and the 80s and 90s called fish bone because that's the age I

00:18:18.10 was at and uh they had this really upbeat positive like happy jingly song

00:18:23.07 called charlie and I just liked it so much because it

00:18:25.22 was just like it's just like a up tempo kind of song and I wanted to play it for

00:18:30.04 my mom so one day we were driving somewhere and I said can I play this

00:18:33.09 tape for you I really think you'll like this song and she's like you know I

00:18:36.12 don't like your music and I'm like yeah but this one's really happy and upbeat

00:18:39.16 it's not like it's not like it's not like bad religion and all that like

00:18:42.15 angsty [ __ ] I listen to and she's like yeah I guess put it in and I had been

00:18:46.21 listening to this album for months and I had never

00:18:50.17 paid attention to the lyrics to that oh my god ever in my life and I heard them

00:18:55.22 for the first time as my mother heard them for the first time after I begged

00:19:00.19 her to let me listen to the song the song is about having sex with an

00:19:05.22 overweight prostitute and it's the lyrics are like like

00:19:10.10 like I love you charlie when you're tickling my wally

00:19:14.02 I love that baby when you shake your fat derriere make me feel good we can watch

00:19:20.08 the sun rise through your pig thighs like my god and it's just over and over

00:19:25.11 and over again about [ __ ] this chick and my mom just got real quiet and I got

00:19:30.21 real quiet and I didn't know what to do so we listened to the entire song and

00:19:35.22 then I just took the tape out and we never talked about it again

00:19:39.14 when your separate ways yeah and I thought I am going to have to I

00:19:43.20 remember I was like 16. I remember thinking I'm going to have to do a

00:19:47.11 better job of vetting stuff in the future.

00:19:52.04 I thought terrible I thought how have I listened to this song

00:19:57.11 four thousand times and never heard it but that was the case that's

00:20:02.14 so much even worse you didn't get up and turn it off why no I was frozen in the

00:20:07.16 moment yeah like you there's something about in a car yeah

00:20:11.19 like there's no subtle way to do that and to do that is an acknowledgement of

00:20:16.17 the scenario it's better to just like act like nothing happened just

00:20:20.17 barrel through and I also exist especially at a younger age to make

00:20:24.11 other people uncomfortable you know I used to be way worse about it so it was

00:20:28.19 like in my wheelhouse so I was kind of like

00:20:30.23 like I kind of well I was facing myself right like I had to do it because I'd

00:20:35.03 started it and I knew it was like maybe damaging my relationship with my mom but

00:20:40.08 it was also like this will be a story someday and turns out it was 40 years 30

00:20:44.12 years later Jesus

00:20:47.03 there's nothing I'm trying to like compare all the times that I've thought

00:20:52.09 like oh this video this YouTube video is funny I'm going to show my friend and

00:20:56.08 they just don't laugh at it the anxiety of that and the wanting to die and that

00:21:00.17 100 times worse being in a car with your

00:21:03.02 mom just strapped into that how long was the song

00:21:06.01 oh I don't know it's like three minutes okay it's not like two or three minutes

00:21:09.16 it's not the longest song in the world or anything but it was it felt long

00:21:13.09 yeah it was like I had never heard the song before until that moment and then

00:21:18.23 everything crystallized and my mom definitely heard it I watched her face

00:21:23.16 go like concerned glanced over at me back at the road and

00:21:27.09 just watched her body just turn off she just went cold and like rigid and I was

00:21:32.11 just like what am I doing and what am I doing to this lady [Music]

00:21:38.02 it's so much worse that you argued for it you like no I did I had to convince

00:21:43.01 her yeah because I was like so annoying about music and she was just like I'm

00:21:46.08 not going to like it I don't want to hear your music I I get that you like it

00:21:49.18 it's not my generation it's not for me and I'm like no no this one's a good one

00:21:53.11 it's happy there's like a trombone and [ __ ] you'll like it you know how much

00:21:56.19 time passed after that until you spoke again I have no idea

00:22:00.17 probably when we got where we were I don't know

00:22:04.02 I just like I just remember looking out the window a lot [Laughter]

00:22:09.07 oh should we hey we talk.

00:22:18.06 I don't know is this okay well I'll talk about the thing I was going to talk

00:22:22.06 about I had a realization from a previous I

00:22:25.13 saw a comment about this on I guess the one two episodes ago

00:22:29.15 I've been saying something wrong my entire life

00:22:33.04 and I've always been kind of like somewhat aware that it could be wrong oh

00:22:38.04 can I guess yeah go ahead is it wheel barrel that's absolutely yes so

00:22:45.14 I I said wheel barrel I've always thought it was wheelbarrow I had no idea

00:22:51.09 it was wheelbarrow the wheelbarrow sounds weird to me I

00:22:54.21 said wheelbarrow you guys didn't call me on it in the episode I saw comments

00:22:59.09 where people brought it up um and yeah it's a weird as a weird one and

00:23:04.13 then I watched this is like a strange sort of pivot but same type of idea

00:23:08.20 spoilers I guess for anybody who cares about Dexter they made a new season

00:23:13.16 of Dexter um and I realized that I had completely

00:23:17.19 misremembered how that show ended which was very odd like that was the only

00:23:22.07 value of watching the new season they a lot of the new season is about

00:23:26.13 the fact that they don't know that he was a serial killer and in my head

00:23:31.09 that's how that show ended that everybody knew oh

00:23:35.03 yeah like he got caught and then he went into isolation

00:23:37.13 and so then to watch a whole series in which nobody knows that but I thought

00:23:41.15 everybody did was very strange so I've been trying to be after the wheelbarrow

00:23:46.10 wheel barrel I'm trying to think of things that I I think are true or that I

00:23:50.19 believe that are just completely wrong it's been an exercise and I'm hoping to

00:23:55.14 find more wheelbarrow wheelbarrow content there there's um a lot of stuff

00:23:59.17 like that where I don't pick up on it while we record but then when I listen

00:24:04.12 back I'm like oh he said wheel barrel yeah I feel like it sounds better a

00:24:07.22 wheeled barrel is fun to say it's more fun than barrow if it was a barrel on

00:24:12.00 wheels it would make sense I feel like those exist as a as a wheel I feel like

00:24:17.22 I've seen that used as a like a half a barrel as the barrow part

00:24:22.21 the wheel barrel as a concept makes sense right it's like a barrel you store

00:24:26.16 stuff in a barrel you put a wheel on it you wheel it around it's the same thing

00:24:30.05 as a wheelbarrow I get how you would get there and they sound close enough that

00:24:35.09 whenever I hear it I just go in my head wheelbarrow like it would just

00:24:38.12 adjust what does your mom say I have no idea we should find out I will

00:24:43.01 next time I see her I'll show her a photo of it I'll say what is this could

00:24:47.07 have been a genetic thing that she passed down her eggs [Laughter]

00:24:53.18 hey should we I uh I had one of those that Gavin fixed

00:24:59.07 me on I I never knew what the word I had been misusing the word pent ultimate my

00:25:04.05 entire life until Gavin corrected me 10

00:25:06.00 years ago in the chima hunter but you used to get double wrong I was using a

00:25:10.10 double wrong you were using it in the wrong context and saying it wrong

00:25:14.10 yeah you were you you were saying pent ultimate as though it's like the

00:25:19.01 ultimate yes but it's not pronounced pent ultimate it's penultimate and it

00:25:24.02 means yeah like one before yeah or like yeah and I was totally wrong on all

00:25:29.04 fronts and you fixed me thank you I appreciate that but to be fair you you

00:25:32.23 have a lot of you have a lot of good word knowledge like you you have used I

00:25:36.23 guess being a journalist you use a lot of words that I didn't know like I feel

00:25:40.07 like you will never turn down the opportunity to use the word assuage

00:25:44.00 you'll get that in there whatever you can but I do like that word

00:25:48.02 the fact that you didn't know penultimate I just thought

00:25:51.05 it's clearly a different like an American thing like no I never corrected

00:25:54.22 you on it for a while before I realize oh he is just using it I think I think

00:26:00.04 where a lot of that comes from is my entire vocabulary comes from reading

00:26:03.20 and so when you read and you see a word you don't know a lot of times you figure

00:26:07.12 it out via context clues and so sometimes you pronoun you you learn to

00:26:10.16 pronounce it wrong because you read it first or you get the definition slightly

00:26:15.05 askew uh from from the actual definition just

00:26:17.20 because you're you're picking up on the context clues wrong um I there's

00:26:21.06 probably a lot of those in my life actually because there are some things

00:26:24.13 between england and the us where the literal opposite thing

00:26:29.22 means the same thing so like I I would use the phrase well I couldn't care less

00:26:35.00 but people here might say I could care less which to me means well that's

00:26:39.06 grammatically the opposite of what I'm saying like you could care less so why

00:26:43.09 are you saying that but it just they use it in the same way

00:26:46.09 should we talk about uh because it is a germain which is another good word uh to

00:26:50.11 this conversation uh should we talk about like the tour

00:26:54.10 that Gavin and I went on and yeah absolutely

00:26:57.03 so about it so last week Gavin and I went on you know for our other day job

00:27:02.01 the non-face job we're a part of this gaming group called achievement hunter

00:27:06.19 which we definitely don't talk about on this podcast but we had to do a west

00:27:10.15 coast tour so we played shows in Seattle

00:27:13.01 and we played shows in san Francisco and a show in los Angeles and it's like a

00:27:17.13 three-hour kind of like I don't know like would you say like a variety show

00:27:21.14 gav we do like role play and play video games play wrestling

00:27:27.05 some comedy just a bunch of nonsense right just a bunch of different

00:27:31.18 presentations and minor league fan jack is the one who

00:27:35.06 kind of uh spearheads that it's kind of his creative baby and so he penciled us

00:27:39.16 in Gavin and I in the past have always uh you know because we're buddies as he

00:27:43.22 has he described last episode I'm I'm the best friend I'm his best friend ever

00:27:48.23 uh which feels really good to hear man thanks and uh I imagine I

00:27:52.19 I I imagine that I imagine it would probably feel good for you to hear that

00:27:56.15 back and just knowing how good it felt to me um and uh

00:28:00.13 so he penciled us in for like we you know we have these big 20-minute

00:28:05.05 15-minute uh productions that we do and then we have little interstitials while

00:28:08.17 we clear the stage or change costumes or whatever and so Gavin and I in the past

00:28:12.09 have always done like a dumb little five-minute thing uh one time he dared

00:28:16.05 me to eat a bunch of olives I couldn't do it uh in the time allotted we used to

00:28:20.03 throw gummy bears and try to catch them

00:28:22.04 each other's mouths just dumb [ __ ] then we played a game of nut bull once nut

00:28:25.20 ball yeah so I I figured there should be a face angle for this and by the way

00:28:29.14 we've met a lot of regulation listeners uh a lot of comment leavers they were

00:28:33.22 all wonderful and fantastic people so my angle was

00:28:36.08 I went out I I walked around Seattle and I found the store that sold

00:28:40.10 pre-wrapped gifts and I thought oh that's cool for like eight bucks I can

00:28:44.06 buy a gift and it's pre-wrapped I have no idea what's in it it's a surprise

00:28:49.09 so I landed on the idea because it was the week that the episode I think 97 or

00:28:55.11 96 came out where we uh declared kind of declared war

00:28:58.12 on Lucas Hayden and Edward as like the name of the people who we've never liked

00:29:02.22 who were named those names and I was feeling kind of bad about that so what I

00:29:06.08 did was I went out and I addressed the audience and I told a little about face

00:29:10.01 and then I said is there a Lucas or a Hayden or an Edward in the audience and

00:29:15.10 one person raised their hand and I was like come on up to the stage and they

00:29:18.11 came up and I presented them the gift as an apology on behalf of face and as a

00:29:22.21 peace offering and I said here's your gift we would just like to say Edward

00:29:27.14 we're very sorry we didn't mean to to bemoan all Edwards on earth he should be

00:29:31.18 his id he really was that he really was and we're like so we're like so please

00:29:35.01 accept this uh as a peace offering and if you could then uh relay that to all

00:29:39.08 other Edwards on earth we would appreciate that as well let them know

00:29:42.03 you know put the pitchforks away we're we're on good terms now and uh we did

00:29:46.07 that in every city and every time it was [ __ ] hilarious and every time it was

00:29:50.10 awesome and the first the first city in Seattle that I think it wasn't Edward

00:29:54.02 the dude we had an Edward and a Lucas I don't think we ever had a Hayden two

00:29:57.03 Edwards and a Lucas uh and uh hayden's were [ __ ] hiding like the cowards

00:30:01.18 they are uh and the Edward who came up he had a

00:30:04.00 Russian flex shirt on like so it was perfect oh yeah oh that's true that's

00:30:09.05 correct yeah and uh we also did mini breaks I also found a baseball card shop

00:30:13.03 that had 80 like 8889 and 90 tops cards so I bought a bunch of packs and we

00:30:16.18 tried to get zimmers on stage but we didn't I think a live zimmer would have

00:30:20.19 been phenomenal but a live zone would have been

00:30:23.21 but we did get to apologize uh to all hayden's lucas's and Edward in at least

00:30:29.10 in those three cities and they they all seemed incredibly gracious and grateful

00:30:32.23 I gave one of them I gave one of a koozie because you know I'm always

00:30:36.08 pushing that koozie love so I bought like a Seattle cousin

00:30:39.17 we went to the biscoff store and so I gave away a bunch of biscoffs that I

00:30:42.19 can't [ __ I stand those things but people like him

00:30:45.16 I think it was san Francisco you gave someone a giant biscoff and some

00:30:49.08 left-handed scissors and then at the next show it was like a smaller biscuit.

00:30:54.08 [Laughter]

00:30:56.04 I had one left yeah I went to there was a left-handed store in san Francisco and

00:30:59.12 I was like I'm left-handed so I went and I just bought a bunch of left-handed

00:31:00.23 [ __ ] and then I get and that's kind of a

00:31:03.10 backhanded compliment because I was like if you're left-handed this means a lot

00:31:07.09 too if you're not then endure the hell of of my life [Music]

00:31:12.10 that was awesome is there anything that they don't make left-handed that should

00:31:17.14 oh I don't know um like I feel like most things you pick up a

00:31:21.18 you know like a spatula doesn't need it's not angled any specific way

00:31:26.06 typically I gotta say though dude I agree with you but I they had

00:31:29.17 left-handed pins at that store I didn't buy one but I picked one up and I went

00:31:32.19 let's just [ __ ] stupid all pins are lit and then I went oh no this is

00:31:36.02 different and it felt like how's that good I should have bought it it was like

00:31:39.15 formed to fit around my left hand it was I don't know how else described

00:31:42.23 it and saying it was the best feeling I've ever felt holding a pen I didn't

00:31:47.00 buy it for some reason I'm stupid uh I was just thinking about the bit but uh

00:31:50.17 yeah I I guess you can make a left hand in anything huh

00:31:53.19 that's awesome I just wanted to mention that we have a left-handed gurpler on

00:31:57.22 that that's about to say on behalf of face we've applied we have apologized

00:32:03.17 officially to those three names [Applause]

00:36:50.06 innovations that we've come up with Geoff

00:36:53.05 yeah that was a big part of the tour for

00:36:55.23 me too was talking to you uh please take

00:36:58.05 it away oh has that been developments on the cup oh there have there have been

00:37:01.20 some gurpler developments so this is I I don't know

00:37:05.04 the extent of which we'll we'll be able to produce these but Geoff wanted a

00:37:10.00 larger gurpler if you're gonna have a gurpler there

00:37:12.14 should be a gurplermax there should be a gurpler max

00:37:16.00 and so I was trying to think of like what would be

00:37:19.04 the like the most maximum grip what would be the greatest thing that we

00:37:23.16 could we could put water into or whatever and sell as a drinking thing

00:37:27.11 and the best I came up with was you know those like roadside barriers that are

00:37:31.19 like filled with well you see them in movies like people crash into them yeah

00:37:39.22 yeah so it's like that should be what the gurpler maxes I don't know where we

00:37:45.11 get those I don't know how much they cost but we should sell those and then

00:37:50.10 it somehow pivoted into this other idea of

00:37:54.08 jack has been a minor league fan for a long time now

00:37:57.19 and I'm sure he'd love a super fan status back that the only way

00:38:02.08 in the redemption in the redemption here to give jack his

00:38:05.11 super super fan status back would be because he's been running a lot of

00:38:10.17 marathons and half marathons if we attach some straps to one of those

00:38:15.01 and put a hose in so you know like those camel back things of water like those

00:38:19.06 small very portable water packs that like joggers will drink out of while

00:38:22.10 they're running so they don't have to stop if we essentially turn one of those

00:38:26.15 barriers into one of those and if he can run a

00:38:30.17 whole race with it starting full then he gets superficially like 800 pounds

00:38:36.00 we and we thought we talked about that we only it only has to be a 5k and he

00:38:40.08 just has to complete it and it gets easier the faster he drinks absolutely I

00:38:44.20 just want to see the reaction of people around them like all these people have

00:38:48.11 like camel backs and you got one guy with like backpack straps and this giant

00:38:52.17 [ __ ]

00:38:54.02 Just monster of a container and he has to

00:38:57.01 hold he has to hold he can't like put on a wheel no he has to wear it like a

00:39:02.07 cable it can't be a wheelbarrow no

00:39:06.08 because you may have invented the girlfriend [Laughter]

00:39:12.00 I love how much stuff that we want to sell like and the stuff we've done like

00:39:16.15 the port a potty and stuff that can easily be taken from like a construction

00:39:21.16 site uniform has some real industrial vibes uniform likes to go to go to like

00:39:28.02 apartment complex construction sites and just say what do you got laying around

00:39:33.07 we'll take it we can drink out of that uh so then we

00:39:37.12 decided if you're gonna have a gerbler max you've got to have a smaller version

00:39:42.12 of the gurpler so and Andrew came up with I thought was

00:39:47.05 brilliant uh the lil girp lil girp and it's a baby girler and Andrew what

00:39:53.20 how how does that look it's a thimble

00:39:58.17 your little girp is a thimble or you can get a construction sized barrel as the

00:40:04.13 guppler max and then we just have your basic kitchen gurpler

00:40:08.19 maybe you could use the thimble to decant your uh bothering thick bobble paste

00:40:13.21 before you dilute it dude if we can get jack drinking bottle out of a big oh go

00:40:19.20 that sounds awesome so Eric we'll need you to we'll need you

00:40:24.04 to get with e-comm and get get into production on those please yeah uh

00:40:28.18 yeah I think it I gurpler full of boveril is like making

00:40:33.18 my stomach turn yeah that is just imagine tripping on the finish line spilling

00:40:39.07 bubble all down the race and he's like jump over this if you're vegetarian

00:40:45.20 I'm just imagining him tripping knocking it over and just the odor and just like

00:40:51.07 everybody puking around no I'm just like smells good does it okay in my head

00:40:56.13 every aspect of it is disgusting probably smells like like beef

00:41:01.03 like what do they call it beef like uh bone marrow

00:41:05.01 like bone marrow like beef bone marrow yeah kind of like what you cook with

00:41:10.01 yeah like uh I would assume like like beef stock probably oxo cubes

00:41:14.12 yeah exactly like that hey I also uh can I can I show you guys something that

00:41:20.00 I'm very excited about that so I I mentioned to you guys a while ago when I

00:41:25.05 was uh I did I I got ecom to buy me the the industrial

00:41:30.13 uh gold foil stamping machine and so that we could hand so that we could

00:41:35.15 number uh cards to make it official for like break shows and stuff and then I I

00:41:40.21 got the idea to uh to get a custom stamp made well that stamp came in

00:41:45.21 and I did a test and I wanted to show you guys the test I'm excited I'm very

00:41:50.04 excited about it I think it looks amazing that looks so good

00:41:54.02 that looks incredible that's not [ __ ] it's not [ __ ] that's the

00:41:57.13 medium there's a large that's about the size of the card and a small that's much

00:42:02.06 smaller I just did the medium one as a test

00:42:05.16 isn't that [ __ ] good though doesn't it look professional as dicks oh my god

00:42:10.21 it looks too good for us like it's I am amazing it's

00:42:14.08 eric's right he says the gold is stellar obviously we'll put it on the on the

00:42:18.01 Instagram but I think it looks wait if you can't see it uh it's an ian looking

00:42:22.12 up you know standard to ian uh and it's I don't know half the size of the card

00:42:28.19 it's the outline uh and it is in gold it's embossed in gold into the card it's

00:42:33.20 beautiful I would love you to also get one made of your first attempt to ian

00:42:39.01 I don't even remember that do we have that anymore it's like

00:42:43.07 probably in this chat I'm just floating above the head

00:42:45.17 it's like a triangle nose yeah I'm gonna throw this in there too just because

00:42:49.05 when I was pulling this card out to to stamp it today I noticed this card and I

00:42:52.11 thought it was the funniest baseball card I have ever seen and it's not for

00:42:55.09 anything other than I just want to make you guys laugh so here's here's the card

00:42:58.23 I saw today Archie Bradley Archie Bradley is doing that's a highlight

00:43:03.22 that is an incredible incredibly high straight leg pile

00:43:08.00 yeah but he's also like turned to the side so he looks like he's doing like

00:43:12.12 some sort of vaudevillian dance number at the same time pretty impressive he

00:43:17.02 looks like a rag doll that's like a halo

00:43:19.07 rag doll after a grenade went off that's what that looks like Eric says he's

00:43:24.04 doing a street fighter kick yeah yeah are you aware that we totally messed up

00:43:29.13 the baseballs what do you mean me being Geoff just us as a group we blew

00:43:34.12 it oh how and what what well listen to this I would guess I probably

00:43:39.09 hit 50 home runs and we decided that we would box up a

00:43:43.18 ball if he swinged or swung and missed but not if he didn't swing so he either

00:43:49.05 hit it or he swung and missed and that's

00:43:51.19 what we're selling so we're only selling the ones he missed yeah like if he

00:43:54.20 didn't go for the swing we just put it back into the rotation to pitch again

00:43:59.18 hang on hang on hang on that is weird if if Geoff swung the bat at the ball that

00:44:06.10 ball is being sold whether it was connected with it or not yeah that's it

00:44:12.06 that's incorrect we I hit every ball eventually uh the ones that we swung and

00:44:17.16 missed we we went we I hit it again so Eric and I explained what we did and

00:44:22.14 then Geoff's explained it in a completely different way uh

00:44:27.00 is that what you think happened Geoff what do you mean

00:44:30.08 well we had the whole discussion months before where it was like you know it'll

00:44:33.15 be a blind box to you you won't know if you get one that's been hit or if it was

00:44:38.12 a miss but then yeah we but what we ended up doing was because

00:44:41.19 it was going so well as any ball that I missed we just threw it through the

00:44:45.09 pitching machine again and I hit it so I ended up actually connecting with every

00:44:48.15 ball we sold yeah except we didn't do that didn't we no no no

00:44:54.00 no you swung at it we pulled it off to the side the only ones that I was

00:44:58.05 throwing back were the ones that you didn't swing at oh okay I missed that

00:45:02.07 but you were you were helping me point out you're like I swung at that one

00:45:06.06 yeah okay that's right I guess I got that wrong in the moment then I was just

00:45:10.03 hitting balls all day long we can still do it your way but we just

00:45:14.19 have to go out and then re-hit basically the entire compilation I made of you

00:45:20.13 missing uh not hit so we could go out and do them all well

00:45:24.00 the compilation of me missing was well some of those were foul tips I only

00:45:27.22 missed maybe 40 balls out of the 250.

00:45:30.03 You you did not miss a lot a lot of those like what what you guys saw in the

00:45:35.07 video of the misses were all of the misses but again we like

00:45:40.00 there are so many more balls in the other video that you'll see that yeah

00:45:45.09 are just absolutely crushed and when I went out and played baseball this last

00:45:48.23 week we found even more in the woods yeah he hit way more than he missed we

00:45:54.02 just thought when we originally talked about it it'd be funny if

00:45:58.04 you know in a face way you might be buying just a piece of [ __ ] that was

00:46:01.13 completely whiffed but at least you know at least you knew he swung at it that

00:46:04.23 makes sense because I got one in the mail uh that does not have any kind of

00:46:09.06 connection on and I went like that's weird I was pretty sure I hit all those

00:46:13.01 I got one in the mail but I have probably

00:46:16.02 20 in my garage so it's really that was a real I just kind of threw mine back in

00:46:20.01 there and went uh this should probably go to someone else uh I thought that

00:46:25.01 what you were gonna say about messing up the baseballs is that um

00:46:30.02 it it's not really a stamp and Geoff just sort of filled his name with

00:46:35.00 paint and then no actual like autograph was on the ball well I talked about that

00:46:39.09 last week right yeah so oh speaking of which we have about a hundred balls left

00:46:43.10 that we need to figure out what to do with and somebody on the Instagram

00:46:47.12 reached out to us who is like a professional paint maker and he said if

00:46:52.12 we can give him what the the color gurple is he will mix up

00:46:56.10 uh a couple gallons of gurple paint and send it to us and then we can hit the

00:47:00.07 ball the remaining hundred balls with gurple that's amazing so I think that's

00:47:04.13 that's an interesting idea I think it's a great idea so that's

00:47:07.16 really great are you okay with what we did then or do you want to go out and

00:47:10.23 re-hit the ones that you swung and missed it well I only missed a few I

00:47:14.06 only missed like 30 or 40 so I'm fine with it I think it's funny if they're

00:47:18.02 not re-hit I think just a small percentage of people just getting a ball

00:47:21.09 that has no I think at all creates more excitement when you when you're buying

00:47:24.15 something blind and then you yeah I totally either get screwed or you get a

00:47:27.20 great little thing some of them actually got painted even though you missed

00:47:31.20 because you swung paint on to them I was so

00:47:34.21 like dialed in and hot and exhausted and focused that I I was just hitting what

00:47:39.12 was in front of me so I probably got confused at some point out of out of 250

00:47:45.07 I must have hit 210 probably oh easily easily most of them are hit yeah

00:47:50.00 I like the idea too of anyone who gets a miss ball

00:47:52.07 they can see like theoretically they could see the ball that was missed yeah

00:47:56.19 it's an easy like they have the footage of like they can see their ball and play

00:48:01.06 they definitively know it's one of these balls yeah if you get a clean ball

00:48:05.22 you were yeah that's a that's an excellent point Andrew

00:48:08.16 when we go out and do this again because we're gonna have to hit more balls we

00:48:12.09 have to find a different field you hit Geoff I don't know how else it you hit

00:48:17.05 them too far you have to go we have to go to a bigger field

00:48:21.12 where we can actually go out and like shag the balls instead of having to like

00:48:24.22 find them in the woods later we have to find a bigger field or just

00:48:29.12 one with a big net at the back yeah or I guess one with a big net at

00:48:33.12 the back well like a high fence like some of them have much higher fences

00:48:37.09 right yeah I only have I only have two modes hit gavin's camera or hit home run

00:48:42.04 I don't know how to do it that's the only the only two ways I know how to hit

00:48:46.13 so yeah we'll have to get a different a different field I guess

00:48:50.19 uh Eric and Andrew did a did a little thing on the YouTube this week we did

00:48:56.15 yeah yeah

00:49:00.19 Geoff

00:49:04.04 no I was not a fan I like a prank that gets resolved in the moment like

00:49:11.20 you show me the video and we laugh about it and then I get my redemption four

00:49:17.09 minutes later when we show the other video just releasing of a without

00:49:22.01 explanation a two-minute video of me striking out with no explanation and for

00:49:27.11 days without me being able to engage and explain what's going on

00:49:31.20 it was frustrating especially considering that video has like 30000

00:49:36.04 views and the YouTube video above it where I do hit the balls has like 7000

00:49:39.20 views and all of the comments from people I got for two days that were like

00:49:44.04 I [ __ ] knew you sucked I told my wife you suck she was right she's some

00:49:47.16 [ __ ] embarrassed for you and I'm like Jesus Christ okay we have the other

00:49:52.17 video going up tomorrow where you look like a true hero [Music]

00:49:56.18 so let's let's go through this series of events because it is

00:50:00.19 facing on several levels we all are apparently the worst communicators that

00:50:05.21 have ever existed I don't disagree I originally had the idea

00:50:10.08 of like oh it'd be funny if we put the misses out a day before

00:50:14.13 it ended up coming out with people who are sponsors on rooster teeth could

00:50:18.12 listen to the episode uh so there there's a portion that could see all of

00:50:21.22 it but I thought it'd be funny if there was like one day where the majority of

00:50:25.10 people would only have that as a point of context then they would listen to the

00:50:29.20 episode the next day and the video would be out the next day

00:50:32.14 to see all the hits so they'd be wrong like I in the brief moment I had where I

00:50:36.13 thought Geoff just missed a lot and then realized that Geoff hit essentially

00:50:41.20 nothing but dingers he hit them too far as Eric was saying

00:50:45.22 so I suggested this idea to Eric and then Eric said that he talked to you

00:50:49.13 about it Gavin to get approval for it but I guess it wasn't clear it was going

00:50:54.10 on the YouTube like there was no communication I made this fit I mean

00:50:57.13 like Geoff's saying I'm only capable I like doing it how Geoff likes it I I

00:51:01.13 can't let people stew for days on a prank I have to have the instant reveal

00:51:05.05 otherwise I just get uncomfortable like I'm just putting total so I I made those

00:51:09.20 videos just to be well either just to show you or just to

00:51:13.20 put in the actual episode and then for YouTube I was going to cut like a whole

00:51:17.19 you know 1015 minute video of the whole

00:51:20.03 day so I didn't know that existed like I knew you talked about it but I didn't

00:51:25.03 know that that video existed and I wouldn't have even suggested what I

00:51:28.12 suggested if I knew that video existed I thought we only had those two videos so

00:51:33.20 I made that suggestion to Eric not knowing that video existed then Eric

00:51:38.09 talked to you about it because eric's like yeah talk to Gavin he's cool with

00:51:42.04 it like we're gonna we're gonna do it so then I guess it wasn't clear in your

00:51:45.16 communication that it was going on the YouTube no I didn't mention YouTube I

00:51:48.21 assumed it was like because they're so short it'd be on Instagram and the way

00:51:52.07 Eric was talking it was like hey we're just gonna put up the misses I was like

00:51:55.12 okay cool you know I guess until you get a reaction of Geoff and then you put up

00:51:59.07 the other one maybe that's what it sounds like well to be fair too I I

00:52:03.07 normally uh would have been I was a big old baby about it uh I'll be honest but

00:52:08.12 I it just happened to release on a legendarily

00:52:12.13 bad day for me like it was one of those days where like

00:52:16.15 you know I would come in and I would be exhausted and I would talk about how

00:52:20.12 like arrows [ __ ] the crate at four in the morning and it was raining and I was

00:52:24.02 getting duty on emily's brand new dress and all that stuff it was like that like

00:52:28.23 that level of [ __ ] happened like eight times to me that day before I opened up

00:52:33.02 social media and got attacked and I was

00:52:35.06 like what the [ __ ] is going on so I was just in a bad head space that day and I

00:52:40.00 was so I wasn't I wasn't feeling the joke in the moment so totally fair I

00:52:44.12 just had to take a break for a little bit because I didn't want to be mean to

00:52:48.19 you guys I would say that was condiments mini yes

00:52:52.14 yeah but I I shut it down before I turned into condiments max no

00:52:59.09 because I couldn't I wasn't sure initially

00:53:02.10 if you were actually up because I I when

00:53:05.17 I suggested to Eric I was like well this is like obviously a dick move and if

00:53:09.02 Geoff wants to he could like yell at us on the show about it I wasn't sure the

00:53:12.17 legitimacy of how annoyed you were and then it became clear oh this is actually

00:53:16.03 something that really annoyed you I felt bad which then extended to me texting

00:53:21.11 Gavin I think I this has been condimented we cannot

00:53:24.19 we could maybe add a new word to our list of condimented a thing where it has

00:53:29.18 extended into what was a joke into something more real but between that

00:53:35.02 event and the uh previously on face I said Geoff yesterday I was like man while

00:53:39.11 we were on tour this podcast really got away from us it's like we gotta figure

00:53:44.23 out what's going on the previously on working as yo you still have your

00:53:49.17 questions for the previously oh [ __ ] so we can do that oh yeah just before we

00:53:53.14 close that up just to put a loop just to like really summarize how [ __ ] bad we

00:53:57.14 are communicating I communicated to Eric not knowing that you had a full video

00:54:01.11 Gavin I just was not aware of that fact Eric communicated to you what we're

00:54:04.21 gonna do with it but you still didn't understand how it was gonna be used I

00:54:08.21 then asked Eric for the video so we could maybe do something on social with

00:54:12.19 it he told me to talk to nick about it I talked to nick about it

00:54:16.05 never that never happened I never got the video it just didn't come through

00:54:20.02 dude download it from YouTube it's up there right now [ __ ] this entire

00:54:23.20 YouTube this entire team is a complete mess I was in the airport flying home

00:54:28.13 from the tour and I was talking to nick I just proofed the last one and we were

00:54:33.00 talking about like do we leave those hits and misses videos in the episode

00:54:37.10 for the audio one because nick had originally just trimmed it down

00:54:40.23 and I thought maybe we can leave it in and just play the audio from it because

00:54:44.02 I don't want the audio version to be like a [ __ ] watered down version of the

00:54:48.07 video version you kind of want them to be as equal as possible and nick and I

00:54:51.22 will go back and forth like talking seriously about it yeah and then I was

00:54:55.09 like oh maybe we should put it to the group so we put it into the

00:55:00.02 face channel and it devolved into a conversation about cooking beans in a pc

00:55:05.18 and we got absolutely no answers oh I went back to nick I was like well uh

00:55:09.12 well that serves us right for trump it was just chaos everything's been

00:55:13.21 chaos recently and to be clear those videos are still gonna come out like you

00:55:18.10 have the baseball video we're still gonna release your baseball cut oh oh

00:55:23.02 yeah absolutely no we're not losing that con I want to see what that is

00:55:26.13 I absolutely I don't want to sacrifice that if that's done we would be

00:55:30.01 ridiculous to not release that but you do that that means that with with it in

00:55:34.08 the episode the individual videos posted on the YouTube plus my super cut of the

00:55:39.07 entire day they're gonna be used three times in the

00:55:42.17 same place yeah that's fine we're idiots

00:55:45.12 yeah well no it's not it's not ideal but we're dumb and I want to see is there

00:55:49.15 footage in the super cut that isn't in either of the other two cuts loads

00:55:54.08 that's mostly yes then yeah then we're putting out the [ __ ] content part

00:55:58.19 yeah I guess it's like the full video and then and then highlights and low

00:56:03.01 lights what are we gonna name the full one to

00:56:05.12 differentiate it from the other [ __ ]

00:56:08.02 that is out listen we're gonna have to figure that

00:56:11.09 out we're gonna have to get better at this part of it because I only I only

00:56:15.19 sense more video content in our future yeah this is we're having this whole

00:56:19.12 discussion we haven't even broached the subject there's a bean hole video

00:56:22.21 there's the audience has been waiting for that they think we haven't given

00:56:26.02 them but we haven't given it to them because we're gavin's editing it trying

00:56:29.12 to put it together it's that I want to take my time and make decent videos but

00:56:32.19 I also want to whip up some quick [ __ ]

00:56:34.17 each time to show you like if I've just done the thing that week I want to have

00:56:38.04 that update so I quickly that's why I quickly make the digging video or I

00:56:41.10 quickly make the misses and hits video just for us to talk about in the episode

00:56:44.22 we should really upload the digging video as well we should just make sure

00:56:48.11 all of these are available I don't think it matters but you also

00:56:52.08 still want me to make bean hole full version

00:56:54.19 as well absolutely yes right edit Eric I need an editor yeah Gavin is uh I'm

00:56:59.18 gonna that's a tremendous amount of work for

00:57:02.21 Gavin who is a tremendous editor but he's also a tremendously busy successful

00:57:08.03 guy who's I we gotta get him some relief on that I can't imagine like I was

00:57:12.11 talking about I felt so bad that after we ate the beans I was like uh on that

00:57:17.09 Sunday I was like well I'm gonna [ __ ]

00:57:19.05 go home and relax I'm gonna go relax now good good day everybody and Gavin goes

00:57:23.22 I'm gonna go home and watch 12 hours of bean and baseball

00:57:27.18 and I was like oh yeah his day's just starting

00:57:30.12 it's fun though I like it I enjoy it that's I'm excited I'm I'm genuinely so

00:57:34.22 excited with the video we're terrible communicating those may or may not be

00:57:38.07 available I'm assuming they'll be available by the time they hear this who

00:57:42.19 knows you can check our Facebook or not Facebook what's that

00:57:46.03 I don't know why my brain I'm gonna be completely honest with you on Facebook

00:57:51.03 no no that's the [ __ ] you talking about this is what happened okay

00:57:55.07 I told the lactating story backwards from what I wanted to I like shot the

00:57:59.11 ball into the sand trap and I've been in the sand trap the whole show I haven't

00:58:03.08 been able to get out of the center it has been a tough time I've taken several

00:58:07.14 swings I'm just going to trap the trap that's one of the places we're digging a

00:58:11.05 bean hole so just yeah oh and you did reference we I think we

00:58:15.07 do have a very clever idea to try to cook beans in a pc we should try to film

00:58:20.06 that as well let's see if a pc gets the beads hotter

00:58:23.02 than my bean hole never got an answer on how you wanted to handle the videos

00:58:28.00 but at least we got pc beads um questions for the previously on okay uh

00:58:33.02 I can I I have my first question can I ask my can I ask my question absolutely

00:58:37.07 have I ever met this person in real life in my life I'm gonna say no

00:58:42.05 okay that's my question is it one of the is it the lawyer guy is it your first

00:58:47.22 legal team or our legal team [Music]

00:58:51.11 no no Eric you get a question no he knows

00:58:54.17 I already know the answer oh well we're going to ask then ask a really good

00:58:59.06 question

00:59:01.05 nick nick is typing nick knows too Eric you plop a mouth you linked it to nick

00:59:08.04 I don't remember did I tell nick dad you son of a [ __ ] I don't weird

00:59:13.03 because I don't remember tell I don't remember telling nick we're usually so

00:59:17.12 good at communicating this stuff I really don't remember telling me about

00:59:22.23 the previously who wait when would I tell nick I don't know

00:59:27.09 I refuse I refuse to believe this was my phone okay no no no no

00:59:33.14 I could be wrong how will I what hang on hang on this guy

00:59:37.22 never talks on the podcast and just unmuted to say I couldn't be wrong

00:59:42.17 he's gonna have to record a pickup from something okay

00:59:47.16 we're gonna you're gonna message me directly nick who you think it is

00:59:52.13 yeah this can't say it this will know yeah yeah go ahead and uh slack Andrew

00:59:59.08 who you think me right now I think it is.

01:00:05.16 I'll tell you what I I panicked and I said yes uh I do not know what it is

01:00:10.21 I was like I gotta get recorded what are you talking about you didn't

01:00:15.10 remember where you heard it but you don't know dissolved no I totally I had a

01:00:19.21 moment of like oh you know what I'm just

01:00:21.22 saying I know so I don't have to turn on this mic and do all this stuff

01:00:26.04 now the lie has gone too far it's gone is it too deep all right well now you

01:00:30.13 can give a guess yeah now you gotta ask your question go ahead oh is it um

01:00:35.16 is that the person who wrote the variety article is it oh my god no he wasn't

01:00:40.15 there for the last episode

01:00:52.04 imagine being a fan of this podcast the last 15 minutes have been insane

01:00:59.20 this is a good example of the communication thing

01:01:03.03 dude we're falling apart we're full 100

01:01:06.11 episodes in we're worse than ever we need to release a supplemental

01:01:11.16 contact like Eric Eric does his job that's just face communicates [Laughter]

01:01:19.05 oh man are you guys excited for next week it's our it's our 100th episode

01:01:24.00 that's quite a milestone I'm very are we still in season four

01:01:28.21 across the house yeah what are we doing no season four goes for a while we just

01:01:34.14 started season four okay yeah is there a way we can on the website

01:01:39.16 actually reflect the the seasons accurately on our show pages

01:01:44.08 just so it makes no sense to like I can I can try and see what I can do put the

01:01:50.06 one episode or like one and a half episodes or whatever

01:01:55.03 yeah I'll see what I can do yeah awesome so so now Andrew you have

01:01:59.21 stuff planned for episode 100 you have multiple things or just one thing I I

01:02:04.13 have multiple things that I'm on the fence about doing so I might have

01:02:07.21 nothing I either have a lot or nothing that's fair and Gavin you have a story

01:02:11.17 you want to tell is that all you have planned for 100 uh yeah I just I just

01:02:15.05 remembered a story the other day I realized I'd never told it and I thought

01:02:18.12 maybe I'll maybe if there's time on episode 100 I'll tell that one okay

01:02:22.01 I don't want to build it up too much it's just a story but I just want to say

01:02:24.04 so you're what you're saying is this is the best story you will have ever told

01:02:28.06 you don't want to you don't want to build up

01:02:30.17 yet you'll tease it in the two episodes leading up I don't want to tease it you

01:02:34.13 brought it up

01:02:37.05 oh my god I can't wait for this story uh I'll be telling you

01:02:41.05 maybe six out of 10 stories

01:02:45.11 hey maybe he landed the sand trap with me I'll show you how not to get out of

01:02:50.00 it oh man oh I couldn't tell you were rolling around the sand trap up the

01:02:55.05 whole episode oh oh it was pretty hot he was flailing yeah I was flustered I

01:03:00.18 picked up on it uh oh I should say one little piece of

01:03:05.00 housekeeping uh a little kudos I don't know if you guys saw it but um

01:03:09.20 we had another little uh period of growth the last two episodes have uh

01:03:15.00 done like have had been boosted uh in views somehow do we do this in the

01:03:19.10 episode now we discussed the performance yeah I'm just saying like the last

01:03:22.17 couple episodes did really well so we must be on to something

01:03:25.06 you say that like it's a weird thing literally essentially all I hear about

01:03:28.20 the performance of the show is in the episode that's the world's time to get

01:03:32.18 any update ever yeah well you maybe used some of your pleasantries time

01:03:37.10 we uh there was a period I don't know if

01:03:39.07 we've ever talked about it but there was a period where we became uh that we

01:03:42.15 crossed a threshold and became the number one podcast in the company ah and

01:03:46.07 that was ridiculous straight back down again and then we then we dipped and

01:03:49.12 then we dipped for a little bit but now we're boo now we're coming back up again

01:03:54.06 interesting yeah interesting so whatever we did to dip we shouldn't

01:03:59.03 do again and whatever we did to grow we should all only do that

01:04:02.02 ah what do we do to dip I have no clue I don't know I don't know what we did to

01:04:06.01 grow to be honest with you hmm hmm the whole thing was whole thing is

01:04:11.09 perplexing to me I hope the audience likes beef paste

01:04:15.18 well this is how we're gonna cement ourselves with the uk audience right

01:04:20.17 yes Andrew if I send you bother for the next for episode 100 will you drink it

01:04:26.00 or okay I will do whatever you want me to

01:04:28.15 do with it I think we should make a hot bottle and you should drink it I think

01:04:34.00 that's the purest uh can I use my curry to make it oh maybe [Laughter]

01:04:38.19 did I put it in one of my pods I mean it's a tool tools are meant to be used I

01:04:44.10 wonder if bother will make like k-cups and curate things let me look

01:04:49.20 I feel extremely like that's not likely with beef bottle cake oh [ __ ] dude

01:04:56.10 gear heads what the [ __ ] is that uh no it doesn't look like it that's too

01:05:02.13 bad it does look [ __ ] gross though beefy oh you can buy it on amazon oh

01:05:08.15 [ __ ] awesome ew why is god damn dude no offense but some of the

01:05:15.16 some of the graphic design in the uk is still in the 1980s you guys have to

01:05:21.12 modernize post it let me let me look all right hold on copy image does that

01:05:27.01 mean that jack when he's doing the next time on he's going to have to work both

01:05:30.17 really into two different faces like that does not look like something

01:05:34.14 that was designed in the last 20 years well it probably was a dozen what year

01:05:38.03 was that but it looks good update your [ __ ] logo copy image let me do this

01:05:42.17 one this one's a little better I like this one better but it still looks old

01:05:45.17 as [ __ ] it looks like something I would

01:05:48.00 have bought it looks like the canister I would have bought in 1984. I mean I've

01:05:51.07 never seen in that form yeah I've seen that I've seen it in like the tub I've

01:05:54.15 not seen it in the squeeze tube powdered chicken bottle

01:05:59.09 that's the chicken bottle beefy above right is that even

01:06:05.22 is that the same thing right that's a competitor I guess um

01:06:10.17 what is where does bob what is the name bovine real what's the real

01:06:16.10 I have no idea I'm trying to process do you think they

01:06:20.02 went in thinking it would be meat and vegetable extract

01:06:23.18 or like they just started with meat extract they're like we need to extract

01:06:27.20 more extract what else are we going to pull from vegetables

01:06:32.12 it is 42 dollars to buy it is 2.68 cents an ounce for bovrel on

01:06:39.22 amazon good lord Andrew if I ship do you need anything

01:06:43.22 else because it's shipping like just one

01:06:44.19 thing above real to Canada it's gonna be a waste do you need a phone what do you

01:06:48.18 need [Laughter]

01:06:51.01 no I'm good okay you do this is a brick box thing you go with a few other

01:06:56.06 other items if you want could we ever send Andrew an iPhone someday so that he

01:07:01.15 can be blue on our text chains and the [ __ ] images don't come through his

01:07:05.12 postage stamps we can just get on whatsapp I guess I guess so

01:07:10.23 I don't mind because I don't deal with that at all that's not an issue for me

01:07:15.15 honestly it I I don't know how it's still so bad if you send us if anyone on

01:07:20.04 that chain sends a video it's literally like 60 pixels wide yeah it's

01:07:25.14 unbelievable that's great it looks fine for me.

01:07:30.10 [Music]

01:07:31.22 That's a really dumb prop the only issue I have is for some reason when I text

01:07:36.22 when I I don't remember if it's either you Geoff or Gavin one of you pops out as

01:07:41.21 a g as a click able g in my thing and and it's you look the same your

01:07:46.08 symbol is the exact same for me so if I'm texting you both simultaneously it is

01:07:51.10 very risky for me to not accidentally text why don't you just assign a picture

01:07:54.15 to it I probably should that would solve that

01:07:56.14 issue but it's I don't know it's a little it's kind of fun there's that one

01:07:59.18 time where I pitched an idea to Gavin thinking I was talking to Geoff like it's

01:08:03.12 yeah then then I asked you and then you're like sorry I pitched it to the

01:08:06.10 wrong guy and I was like well you can pitch it to me now and you're like no

01:08:11.01 I'll let Gavin pitch you I'll give you the intro Gary can finish it

01:08:16.13 all right we should probably wrap up uh this was the 99th time

01:08:20.19 uh we've done this and uh it just keeps getting dumber so

01:08:25.09 guess I'll finish that video though yeah tune in tune in next week when we do it
