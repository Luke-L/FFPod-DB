00:00:01.01 [Music]

00:00:05.03 Previously on face [Music]

00:00:16.13 hello and welcome to episode 98 of the F**kFuckFacePodcast my name is Geoff Ramsey and

00:00:24.00 with me as always two people one of them is a friend one of them is a co-worker

00:00:29.14 I'll let you figure that out Gavin free and Andrew panton how's it going boys

00:00:34.12 good thanks Audrey which one do you think you are right now well considering

00:00:39.07 that in the description of this show I'm not listed as the friend it would be

00:00:43.09 like just a ridiculous upset if I was the friend and not go with him if I have

00:00:47.20 somehow elevated to Fred during the 98

00:00:50.10 episodes of the show that'd be ridiculous everyone involved with this show has

00:00:55.18 been my friend at one point or another always at the same time I would be

00:01:00.20 gutted because I would consider to this day to this hour Geoff my best friend on

00:01:05.17 the earth and uh if I was relegated to co-worker it'd be very one-sided and I'd

00:01:11.05 be upset I have definitely also considered you my best friend on earth

00:01:14.13 many many times why you said in the past

00:01:16.20 tense not not in the entirety of my life

00:01:19.03 but at different times uh hey by the way speaking of you said gutted speaking of

00:01:23.12 gut Eric our producer extraordinaire how

00:01:25.16 many hot dogs can you eat in one sitting uh it wasn't really a sitting there was

00:01:30.11 a lot of walking and walking around and eating more hot dogs last night I ate

00:01:35.18 four regular hot dogs and one grilled cheese hot dog um that doesn't seem like

00:01:41.07 a lot but I also had like three 32-ounce beers and peanuts it was so full

00:01:45.05 regulation hot dogs and you had you had jalapenos on them right I put jalapenos

00:01:49.08 on every single one of them and I don't feel good so I might be running back and

00:01:53.03 forth during this but please proceed like I'm here the whole time

00:01:55.22 huh running back and forth to [ __ ]

00:01:58.13 uh uh is what you're saying okay yeah I think there's all sorts of implied

00:02:03.16 things that could happen in that scenario

00:02:06.22 why imply let's get into these women I don't think he knows

00:02:11.04 why did you do that to your body because it's hot dog what do you mean why don't

00:02:15.07 dollar hot dog dude what are you gonna do last night was

00:02:18.21 the round rock express a local aaa baseball team is opening week

00:02:23.10 they're playing the el Paso chihuahuas and I was dollar hot dog and soda night

00:02:28.20 and so I had to take advan I walked in walked right to the counter and I said

00:02:33.22 give me two of those bad boys and a 32

00:02:38.04 ounce budweiser and I gotta say as the only uh American of the main

00:02:43.07 three in this podcast uh I I I gotta commiserate with Eric I

00:02:47.03 don't know what it's like in your countries but if you go to a baseball

00:02:50.15 any sporting event in america and they have dollar hot dog night you are

00:02:54.20 legally required as an American to eat at least four I think I would have gone

00:02:59.03 six or seven probably definitely because how do you say no to that is there a

00:03:03.09 Canadian or a British equivalent uh I don't know where I would go to

00:03:06.23 watch baseball but I feel like any any sport I'd find hot dogs for like eight

00:03:11.13 quid so I think if if there was one there for a pound I would I would go ape

00:03:15.09 [ __ ] on him so when you go to a Tottenham hot spurs game that's your

00:03:20.04 team up in england uh and they have like what what are the

00:03:23.10 do they do they have hot dogs what's the food at a soccer game or sorry a footy

00:03:28.03 game in england uh I used to go for like

00:03:30.10 a burger or kebab outside the stadium to save a bit of money uh you can get a

00:03:33.22 little cup of bothering or something if you want what the [ __ ] is what is what

00:03:39.03 a little hot bathroom well I don't know what that what the [ __ ] what hot

00:03:44.17 barrel yeah above real I don't think I could

00:03:47.07 spell that based on how you're saying it it sounds different every time you say

00:03:51.05 it I don't know it's like a what is bob roll it's like

00:03:56.02 it's like hey if you guys had to guess before Gavin tells us what do you think

00:04:00.19 bo what do you think a couple of hot bobs

00:04:04.15 fantastic I'm imagining something black like it's a black gooey

00:04:08.06 oh it's definitely black okay I'm on the right I'm on the right foot here what

00:04:12.11 about you Geoff do you think it's sweet I

00:04:15.20 think it's savory it has to be savory is it like a some sort of a toddy

00:04:19.16 like um like a mulled wine type thing or is it more of like you guys boil

00:04:23.09 vegemite and drink it I think it's very similar to vegetable I think it's like

00:04:26.17 yeast and meat lip paste liquid

00:04:30.19 it's like a like uh it's like a beefy tea everything in your country sounds

00:04:37.18 hideous nobody hideous a beefy tea oh eric's written

00:04:42.15 bother it was the treadmill name of a thick and salty meat extract paste

00:04:47.11 similar to yeast extract yeah so you put you you get that um and you pour hot

00:04:54.00 water in it it's like uh beef paste tea I am so sad I guess that's essentially

00:04:59.11 correct oh god you nailed it oh I mean isn't that sort of just broth

00:05:04.02 you're just eating broth uh yeah it's really good it warms you up on

00:05:09.13 a nice you know cold winter evening at the footy I think we've

00:05:13.14 I think we bumped that to the top of the list for Andrew to try

00:05:17.20 yeah a nice cup of hot bother did they ever have like one quid boverle

00:05:22.11 night where people are just like down five six seven bob rolls and then

00:05:27.07 they're at work the next day going like oh I'm having a bit of a bubble gut from

00:05:33.14 my bar roll I don't know I'm not sure it's

00:05:36.17 physically possible to spend more than a pound.

00:05:41.22 I had nine bottles oh god I'm [ __ ] and straight paste

00:05:47.18 I've just googled it and it says in quotes this fluid of beef fed an army

00:05:53.16 and makes a hearty team.

00:05:59.11 I it is it never ceases to amaze me the off-ramps these conversations take that

00:06:05.22 I just don't see coming I I could easily

00:06:08.21 have gone the rest of my life not having ever heard of bob roll

00:06:13.18 if it weren't for Eric coming in going like I'm going to be on the toilet most

00:06:18.17 of the episode I remember it finally because uh when I used to go to

00:06:23.06 my dad's work as a kid one of the vending machines bob row land you could

00:06:28.21 just dispense I'd be all over that be my little bob real spot [Music]

00:06:36.02 oh this looks terrible

00:06:41.18 [ __ ] gross how is that real I uh oh what's the Canadian version of a hot

00:06:49.07 dog or bob roll Andrew like when you go to a hockey game when you go see the

00:06:54.04 canucks play I don't I don't feel like there is like all that different of a

00:06:59.13 food experience from Canada to america as far as sporting events guests

00:07:04.02 I and like I've never been to a baseball game as a Canadian I fantasize about

00:07:08.06 like I'm going to go to the baseball game I'm going to get hot dogs like when

00:07:12.09 I think about baseball the experience of the game is very secondary to what I'm

00:07:17.11 excited about everything I'm excited about is drinking you'd be outside enjoy

00:07:21.07 the sun eat some hot dogs so I don't have a bottle we wouldn't let bob roll

00:07:26.00 in I don't I I I'm right there with you I think more

00:07:29.17 than any other professional sport and I've I think I've been fortunate enough

00:07:33.13 to attend all the main players uh now that I've been to an f1 game as

00:07:37.13 well uh I think more than any other professional sport a major league

00:07:43.01 baseball game is a day-long experience yes where you take in so much more than

00:07:47.00 the actual game the game is in some ways secondary to everything else that's

00:07:51.02 going on and food and drink is a huge part of that so you like really long

00:07:55.22 games maybe not on tv but definitely in person

00:07:59.03 so you'd like cricket then like a test match ah what do they eat

00:08:04.21 usually in the summer so I probably wouldn't be good for the bob room

00:08:09.16 nice chilled bob roll frosted bob summer bob both really nice

00:08:16.08 oh like a slurpee can we do like a slurpee bomb roll a meat slappy bob pops

00:08:27.05 that's the new face invention I'm gonna freeze I'm gonna freeze meat paste bob

00:08:33.04 pop oh I hate it cool down while you heat up I hate it

00:08:37.22 like a slurpee or not um uh freezy like a freeze freeze tube

00:08:42.15 just having to like push out the paste you know it'll be funny if we filled a

00:08:48.01 grown tube uh with bother or some other drink so that when you drink it

00:08:53.09 that's what we should do we should make we should make

00:08:56.21 we don't have our [ __ ] grown tubes yet because we can't get them made

00:09:02.02 thanks to the supply chain so let's combine them

00:09:05.14 a grown tube that also dispenses drink oh I feel like you're thinking of one of

00:09:09.19 those cups you know like you tilt over and it would moo like a cow like mug

00:09:15.01 type thing but it's just the grown tube noise I think

00:09:17.14 I think this is feasible if I was a cow and I got liquefied into a hot paste and

00:09:22.09 then the sound that I made when I was a live play when someone drank it I'd be

00:09:26.02 livid can we make the sound just go instead of

00:09:29.14 the traditional sound can it just go gross

00:09:34.00 every time you drink it I'm excited to drink a nice hot bottle out of the do

00:09:39.05 you uh gurpler can you imagine a leader of bob roll oh

00:09:44.23 god I feel like a full meal how many calories would be in a liter of

00:09:50.12 above real it's like a third of a cow probably I'm blown away that I've Geoff

00:09:55.20 I've known you for you know the better part of

00:09:58.12 a decade and a half two decades and we've never talked about your life buddy

00:10:03.11 yeah yeah I we've known each other more than half of your life [Laughter]

00:10:08.12 and we've never discussed barrel not once thank god thank god it was today so

00:10:13.18 who's the co-worker that's a great question uh maybe the

00:10:17.02 audience can figure it out uh what else you guys want to talk about today what

00:10:20.21 do you got going on I have a question for Andrew oh okay

00:10:25.08 I'm excited what are you doing

00:10:29.12 like in this moment or no no just face each other what have you done

00:10:35.05 what have you done to it I don't know what that means

00:10:39.20 you're putting [ __ ] like I I'll get a review cut

00:10:43.12 right it's not the final cut oh you've been adding [ __ ] to it

00:10:49.12 what's the beginning what's happened to the beginning of face we've talked about

00:10:55.04 it it's previously on it's a previously on voice

00:10:58.06 yeah but who is it and well that's that's what I figured would be a great

00:11:02.11 mystery for you to find out I thought maybe we could do like a thing where you

00:11:05.16 could ask a question an episode or something about oh okay

00:11:09.11 can I ask the first question can I say first question go ahead right now yeah

00:11:13.09 who's the voice nah I can't say that it's uh you're that's a [ __ ] game

00:11:17.09 Geoff just like asking a genie for more wishes that doesn't count it's illegal

00:11:21.22 we were in the airport getting our luggage as part of our tour and and um

00:11:26.17 my league friend jack walked up to both of us and was like who does the uh

00:11:30.04 previously on voice on Facebook and Geoff and I were like huh because I just

00:11:35.05 you know I just approved the first cut of the episode where there was no

00:11:39.00 previously on voice Andrew and um I was I was like huh and I listen I had to

00:11:43.01 listen to the version that came out Geoff and I listened to it and we were just

00:11:46.09 like looking at each other like what and then I started writing out a slack

00:11:50.06 being like uh does anyone like how did this and then I realized this is a

00:11:55.05 question for content I'm not gonna waste this over slack

00:11:59.01 but it sounds like andrew's not going to tell us no

00:12:01.19 this is a whole mystery I already established this this is long

00:12:06.10 established it's not my fault we talked about this before I wanted to bring in

00:12:09.20 the the variety guy uh to do the voice and that didn't pan out so they kept at

00:12:14.14 it and I didn't remember your idea being to have you know previously on face but

00:12:18.21 it it's the entire episode like it doesn't actually it's the previous one

00:12:22.09 this is just confusing it's really more of a currently like presently happening

00:12:26.19 on this face yeah that's exactly it so I was just as I was

00:12:30.21 interested to see if you two could figure out who it is it's somebody I'll

00:12:34.12 say someone in the universe of the show I didn't just pull a random person

00:12:39.09 everyone's aware of this person and they're in our universe is it the same

00:12:44.15 person every episode it's yeah yes yes it is okay

00:12:47.11 well I my question mike I already used my question for the week so Gavin

00:12:51.16 do you want to take one question um yeah what do I want to know that he's

00:12:55.20 going to answer though I will say I'd love to hear Eric said

00:13:00.00 put Eric is the only other person who knows who it is okay okay well let me

00:13:04.04 ask you this then okay can I have a hint I feel like I already gave it I was

00:13:08.15 going to say I think you already got the hint with it's someone in the scene in

00:13:11.20 the universe I feel like so it's the variety guy or it's the director of the

00:13:15.22 tuxedo or it's I mean he already said it's not the variety guy right oh so

00:13:20.19 it's the director of the tuxedo that was fast is that your official guess

00:13:25.16 is it the director of the tuxedo no so we get one guess per episode one gets

00:13:30.17 per episode brilliant we'll see how long it takes I think it'd

00:13:34.05 take a while I'm excited for this to all be over I accidentally revealed who it

00:13:37.20 is to Eric because I'm an idiot and that'll be fun to talk about we get to

00:13:41.07 the end I thought that Eric was genius when I I said to him

00:13:46.19 uh I'm just dumb it's a dumb mistake I was nervous though Gavin I didn't know

00:13:51.18 what you're talking about it's like what do you mean what have I done

00:13:55.20 did you now is I guess I can't ask any more questions till next week damn it I

00:14:00.05 have so many questions okay next week have an ongoing bet it would be really

00:14:03.16 funny if you if one of you would have just guessed it immediately I would have

00:14:08.00 ruined everything all of my plans everything out the window no point for it

00:14:12.23 who have we talked about so many people we've talked about a lot of people

00:14:17.10 a lot of discussion I think maybe you should go over the keane and kell rap

00:14:20.23 there's a lot of people there just even within that [Laughter]

00:14:24.13 well most people are not dead so that's true

00:14:27.10 but that would be one hell of a pull if I got that is that a thing where uh if

00:14:31.18 Keenan and kell rap about you you will die soon no I don't think so

00:14:36.08 um wait was the key and cal didn't do the rap it's coolia oh yeah that's true

00:14:40.08 I don't know I'm not of your generation we have talked about it like six times

00:14:45.11 on the show though yeah whatever regardless of generation

00:14:49.11 if you got cool here to do it it would be amazing it would that would be really

00:14:55.18 cool does not sound like coolio what if um I'm not going to give anything what

00:15:01.02 well I um let's try and finish this episode

00:15:03.12 because we're double that we're double recording today so I can ask another

00:15:07.16 question in 45 minutes oh yeah I'm just going to stop preparing my next guess

00:15:12.11 so last time we recorded one of these we were very proud of ourselves that we

00:15:16.09 tied up a lot of loose ends that we're like we did it we're typically so bad we

00:15:21.14 set things up we forget about them we move through yeah we did baseballs we

00:15:26.13 did bean hole we we're all excited about it we miss one thing

00:15:30.08 we miss one thing that is important it's a vital thing

00:15:34.01 I was gonna say what the item of clothing Gavin had to wear was yeah I'm

00:15:37.15 really glad you missed it because now every podcast I'm on everyone's just

00:15:41.08 screaming at me that I'm not wearing 64

00:15:43.16 pieces of clothes well we all forgot it I don't think

00:15:46.03 that's fully my fault we were all we threw like a [ __ ] parade of we did it

00:15:50.08 we covered everything uh and we just missed it so this is I'm

00:15:53.15 gonna I'll put in the group chat right now I'll link to we well what words

00:15:57.20 we're all part of the show yeah but you're the one coming up with

00:16:01.02 it that's fair but in my defense also I wanted to collaborate with Geoff on it so

00:16:05.03 that was that was for the idea he did it he didn't collaborate with me is it

00:16:09.14 because he's a co-worker and it was outside of ours um

00:16:13.16 I strongly disagree with this tag by Geoff

00:16:15.13 it was open I said I want him to send me some stuff he was like I think that's

00:16:18.18 perfect I said him one thing he's like I

00:16:20.21 think that's good so we're gonna go with the thing oh I did like is that the

00:16:23.19 thing I did like it that's what I just assumed yeah there's no other discourse

00:16:27.12 about it I mean there are other suggestions that were sent I thought it

00:16:31.22 was on brand this is the one item I'm suggesting just the hat doesn't have to

00:16:35.17 be the tie you undo the tie that's fine just the head piece although I I

00:16:40.09 wouldn't say no to an additional tie to go with all my ties

00:16:44.18 the headpiece is my pick there were a lot of suggest people were really mean

00:16:48.21 Gavin

00:16:52.23 don't know what I rejected people wanted straight jackets people wanted wetsuits

00:16:58.17 like there were clothing it's like handcuffs being clothing

00:17:03.16 I think handcuffs are an accessory I wanted to put you in a sandwich board

00:17:08.04 that says Geoff is awesome thank you how am I gonna sit down you won't

00:17:14.23 so I didn't want to be too mean I just wanted I wanted something on brand I

00:17:19.06 thought it connected well there are all sorts of angles we could

00:17:23.01 have went sandwich board idea is very funny

00:17:25.09 I mean technically like a mascot outfit is a singular piece of clothing

00:17:29.05 depending on how it's designed yeah you don't want to cover up all the

00:17:32.07 other clothes though I mean if there was if we had this talk before I would have

00:17:36.17 seen if I could get like a giant bobble suit just like a mascot

00:17:41.06 that you have to work through but if bother wants to sponsor my appearance on

00:17:46.10 that podcast though I'd be open to it so then

00:17:49.22 Gavin you have to wear the donkey Kong hat or headpiece and 63 other pieces of

00:17:54.05 clothing is that how this shakes out of your choice how it streaks out yeah okay

00:17:59.05 I'm excited to see what you did the audience uh cut Gavin some slack he

00:18:02.21 can't put the donkey Kong hat on until it comes in the mail so yeah it's gonna

00:18:06.09 take some time it'll take some oh yeah I want to get this out of the way as soon

00:18:09.22 as I can so it's such a burden I like that it's just getting 10 degrees

00:18:14.12 hotter in Texas every week that you don't do this [Laughter]

00:18:19.05 [Music]

00:18:20.08 That's great can we talk about I I wasn't even going

00:18:22.23 to necessarily bring this up but we were talking about bovrel sponsoring I found

00:18:27.02 a sponsorship opportunity for us that I'm very excited about

00:18:30.15 I don't think there's any way it will will happen but like sporting events and

00:18:36.08 sponsorship I was reading the news the other day and I saw this

00:18:40.10 story that was like the name of buccaneers have a new owner

00:18:43.18 and I'm like who the [ __ ] are the buccaneers I've lived here my whole life

00:18:47.08 I've never heard of the buccaneers they're a junior hockey team

00:18:52.00 I guess they just sold they won one game last season

00:18:56.10 they lost they played 48 they had one win [Laughter]

00:19:00.19 I'd love to know how much that team sold for

00:19:04.08 it uh it was purchased by I I guess like people moving to the area anyway they

00:19:10.15 have a sponsorship opportunities tab on their website and so it's looking

00:19:14.18 through because I kind of want to get fully invested in the nanaimo buccaneers

00:19:18.17 for their next season just to see if they can get two wins I'm all about two

00:19:22.17 wins so I was considering and I thought I could run it by you guys

00:19:27.09 one of these sponsorship packages to see if we can officially get sponsored or

00:19:32.19 sponsored sponsorship opportunities now a lot of them are sold out

00:19:37.08 but there are some good ones like the face off

00:19:40.16 there is a uh let me scroll down oh dude these are affordable they're very

00:19:45.18 affordable and there's there's some good ones

00:19:48.19 I think the opening face-off is a strong

00:19:52.06 one and I'm assuming it's for the season and not a game based on the premise of

00:19:56.13 sold out helmet 750 dollars how do we put face Eric brings up a good point how

00:20:02.05 do we put face on a junior hockey team that's the hurdle I could see them being

00:20:06.19 very resistant to that but I do like the

00:20:10.00 idea of this opening face off is brought to you by face opening face off oh

00:20:15.07 what if it's uh what if it's uniform or the gurpler itself

00:20:20.12 that is well okay I mean I I thought about that and then I I thought it was

00:20:26.02 funnier if it was face but there is something to be said

00:20:29.18 if we like trojan horse face in through uniform yeah just if they if they if

00:20:35.09 they shut down face immediately because uh why wouldn't they

00:20:40.13 then we should be prepared for a backup I guess the problem I didn't really

00:20:45.07 think about this if we do the face off they have to say [ __ ] at the start of

00:20:51.01 every game there's no way around it I'm so I'm so used to our censorship

00:20:56.00 oh we can send Eric said they can bleep it that's we could send one of our

00:20:59.11 buttons they could push the button at the same time

00:21:05.01 we can sponsor this but you have to update your audio system

00:21:09.15 your pa system to use it we will not pay for that

00:21:13.15 but we will pay for the the opening opening face-off yeah I guess face is

00:21:18.23 even less viable than I considered because in my head it's always the hmm

00:21:22.19 so we might have to go uniform but I'd like to I don't know I thought this

00:21:26.00 would be a funny thing to get invested in I'm blown away at how much is sold

00:21:30.15 out there's a lot of stuff you can't get like the jersey the shoulder patch

00:21:34.15 the pant shell whatever that is I feel like

00:21:38.03 I feel like it has to be the opening face off because I don't think the logo

00:21:41.22 on the helmet would be that big but for the announcer to be like this

00:21:46.19 face-off is brought to you by unifarm or whatever I think it's very funny

00:21:50.11 oh my god can can we make him say the full spiel too like this face off is

00:21:54.12 brought to you by uniform uniform combining the power of one with the

00:21:57.12 fabric of the farm uniform go or however you start off do you start

00:22:02.15 a hockey game with ghosts start a hockey game by yelling go go.

00:22:13.01 I'm so for this idea I love this idea same and I can't believe the prices yeah

00:22:19.20 I was so excited about it because like I clicked it thinking like uh this is

00:22:24.17 gonna be way out of our price range but uh it's it feels viable feels like a

00:22:29.12 thing we could do let me see if I could pull up their record for the league

00:22:33.18 their league standings from the regular season of this year okay nanaimo

00:22:39.11 buccaneers 48 games played one win 43 losses in regulation

00:22:43.16 three losses in overtime one shootout loss

00:22:49.07 isn't this kind of how the mighty ducks started though like we're one

00:22:54.22 of us away from being a kick-ass kid so dude

00:22:58.19 they got some crowd advertising to an average attendance of 400 to 600 people

00:23:04.00 that's more people to listen to this podcast.

00:23:08.06 I would love to hmm I guess they'd never find us because of uniform but it would

00:23:13.09 be how many if we could do face do you think we'd convert two people into

00:23:19.03 listening yes like at least I think that

00:23:21.12 would be that should be our our our goal for return on investment is we should

00:23:27.12 pay 1500 to acquire two listeners [Laughter]

00:23:31.22 and uh just to like to put into perspective so

00:23:35.01 they got six points so they got two points for a win and then four one

00:23:39.18 points for the overtime losses the the second to worst team in the

00:23:44.16 league had 33 points it's 16 wins there's a gap there's a

00:23:49.10 large gap between them and even the like the next worst team oh this is

00:23:54.04 can we see a game while we're there I'd love to I don't know when their schedule

00:23:57.15 is I need to look more into that I'm gonna maybe uh

00:24:01.12 depending on what time it is crabbing in the morning and buccaneers

00:24:06.00 and then we'll celebrate with some bagels oh I really I really like this

00:24:11.04 if you can get that schedule maybe we can plan our trip around that schedule

00:24:14.17 their their hockey schedule absolutely I'll look into that but I should I

00:24:17.18 should talk about bagels please talk about bagels I've been I don't know

00:24:21.05 about Gavin but I've been waiting uh for

00:24:23.04 all week to hear about this I don't know

00:24:24.21 how much Gavin knows about bagels I know you know a little bit more Geoff this is

00:24:29.14 this has been I need to thank let me pull up my notes first of all I need to

00:24:33.03 thank Jeremy jenny almond specifically because she accidentally put all this

00:24:37.16 into motion so last we left off I talked about I accidentally followed them on

00:24:42.01 the pod account and I started following them and uh they had 23 followers at the

00:24:47.18 time I believe on twitter uh and I was like oh man I

00:24:52.01 hope they fall back or something happens earlier

00:24:56.08 uh last week I got a dm from jenny and she was like hey I emailed them and told

00:25:00.17 them about the show because I was curious if there was

00:25:03.18 anything I could buy like I live in america like if there's a way I could

00:25:07.12 support them in some way and so I just talked to them and I thought oh [ __ ]

00:25:11.05 like they have somebody has now interacted with them that is from the

00:25:16.04 audience like they now are absolutely aware that we exist in some capacity yeah

00:25:21.22 it's I guess it's great in based on all of your previous correspondence and all

00:25:27.05 of like as a podcast I'm terrified now I'm terrified of where it goes from here

00:25:30.17 absolutely well I was nervous it's like well did you think they would listen do

00:25:34.14 you think they just like looked at I don't know what would they do because

00:25:38.17 now they know they're mentioned and then that evening they followed the Facebook

00:25:42.19 twitter account and I was so excited then they followed me it's the most

00:25:47.12 excited I've been to get any notification ever I was losing my mind

00:25:51.05 that I got on my hubby's bagel follow then they dm the podcast account and I

00:25:56.05 was I was too star struck and nervous to reply that evening it felt

00:26:01.01 I don't know if you've seen the movie swingers you know like when john favreau

00:26:05.07 gets the number and they're all like you gotta wait two days to reply you can't

00:26:08.19 seem over eager like heather graham's number right I think so yeah yeah in the

00:26:13.09 movie I had that experience but it was just like I'm too excited about this to

00:26:17.09 like actually reply because they wrote a

00:26:19.11 super sweet message they had never heard of the show they had no concept of our

00:26:24.13 awareness or rooster teeth existence they're very confused by all of it but

00:26:30.02 in like a nice way um so then we started going back and

00:26:33.22 forth and we've become like friends over like the past two weeks or texting

00:26:37.12 it's been great and it's been very we've talked about how this is a show that is

00:26:43.12 a deep lore about nothing and I've never had to try to explain some of that lore

00:26:47.19 to somebody completely removed from it and boy has it been a time just like a

00:26:52.06 normal person a normal member of society yes a normal it is so hard cause

00:26:57.22 somebody I tweeted about it and so replied like

00:27:00.07 I guess I'm going out order here they uh they said that I will get to name a

00:27:04.10 regulation bagel so I'll get to come up with a name for a bagel and it'll be the

00:27:08.06 regulation bagel it'll be something that anybody can get if they go into the

00:27:11.20 store they can order the regulations you're saying the name of the bagel is

00:27:15.11 the regulation bagel it's well I'm still working out the specifics of it I think

00:27:20.09 what it's gonna be is like a menu item that you could like if you're a fan of

00:27:23.20 the show and you go to my hubby's bagels you can order the regulation bagel they

00:27:27.05 will know what it means and it will be a specific thing it's like it's even

00:27:30.19 better than being on them on the board it's like uh it's like a secret menu

00:27:34.11 item this is exactly a sort of I think we're leaning as the secret that was

00:27:39.05 such a funny uh because they said that and then a few days went by and uh the

00:27:43.15 person uh drew who I was talking to his name is drew which is very funny uh was

00:27:48.12 like yeah I'm I'm kind of I'm trying to struggling to figure out like how to

00:27:53.20 incorporate regulation into this into this menu I'm working on and uh I

00:27:58.12 was like oh you know that's that's fine like I I would

00:28:02.02 be so much happier if you had a menu that you were excited about and fully

00:28:05.17 happy with than you trying to shoehorn regulation in if you don't see a fit

00:28:10.03 like just do it like makes you happy and he's like yeah I'm not having a hard

00:28:13.21 time with the regulation it's trying to get face on there that I'm struggling

00:28:18.15 with and I was like no you don't have to nobody

00:28:22.02 nobody expected it to be called the face regulation bagel you don't need to do

00:28:28.02 that we can just move on from that just regulation bagel's great and then

00:28:33.18 we came up yeah we should make a clip like

00:28:36.21 don't pivot your own business we'll bend to you yeah you don't need to work we

00:28:40.19 don't even say our own name it's fine so then like trying to I always have to

00:28:44.14 feel like when you start those conversations explaining why we're

00:28:47.19 called what we're called and then somebody replied to when they said that

00:28:51.12 I could name a bagel someone was like andrew's gonna salad cream these bagels

00:28:57.05 and then they replied I should really learn what that means

00:29:00.14 before I let him into my store

00:29:03.20 and I'm like that's terrible so then I had to explain to a normal person

00:29:09.14 what salad creamed means and how it makes sense it's like trying to teach a

00:29:14.20 different language yeah I like that you're having to

00:29:18.16 explain what salad creaming as a verb means yeah not what's salad cream

00:29:24.09 we need we need a handy face pocket dictionary that we can give out yeah we

00:29:29.14 do to help translate we need a stationary so I I had to explain that

00:29:34.00 and then there was a time so they're getting ready to open

00:29:37.19 and then all of their burners there's something wrong with their burners and

00:29:40.22 like the electrical wasn't going as planned so they couldn't make bagels and

00:29:44.22 they learned this while they were like preparing to open so it seemed like

00:29:48.16 there was there's a window of time in which it it seemed like they were gonna

00:29:52.01 have to open up without the ability to cook or make bagels

00:29:55.11 so they would be a bagel shop that couldn't sell bagels I'm like you guys

00:30:00.12 are perfect this is the greatest like face integration ever a bagel shop that

00:30:06.04 can't make or sell bagels we're all about this um they luckily they figured

00:30:10.08 it out so I explained they're like so what does salad cream mean and I'm like

00:30:13.17 uh salad cream it sort of is like when you screw up an anticipated moment and

00:30:19.05 they immediately replied I guess we salad creamed our opening and I'm like

00:30:24.15 yeah that's perfect oh my god it's inadvertently you found the perfect

00:30:30.11 people what a great sort of unwritten partnership they're they're incredible

00:30:35.09 they've been so sweet and their food is absurd it is so good I

00:30:40.01 talked about before like not wanting to commit to like doing a review or talking

00:30:43.12 about it because I wouldn't want the audience to interpret that as like I

00:30:47.12 didn't like it or whatever it's incredible so you went down there I they

00:30:51.13 had a soft open yesterday I went down there they're nice enough to bring some

00:30:55.23 challah earlier in the week to try they brought me some coffee they have a

00:30:59.11 coffee partnership I have a cup of cof I'm going to have my first coffee in a

00:31:05.01 moment like a proper as part of the redemption year I forgot I did this but

00:31:09.06 I made a monstrosity of a coffee at one point on this show and I've never tried

00:31:13.12 it again well didn't you make like cheerios with coffee or something

00:31:18.11 it was it was like I had a cured keurig pod that was like vanilla walnut Italy

00:31:24.04 was the flavor like it didn't make sense and then it didn't taste good so then I

00:31:29.07 dumped the sugar cookie in it and I poured in a bag sour patch kids watermelon

00:31:34.17 it was a mess it was terrible animal well I was just trying to salvage I was

00:31:39.16 like this is bitter I don't have any sugar here's some sugar cookies have

00:31:43.09 some sugar cookies I like that you did that with the coffee you also did that

00:31:47.12 with your salad

00:31:49.16 well the salad I think those were different issues I see here I see your point

00:31:55.05 trying to think am I missing they're the biggest uh the coffee I have

00:31:59.19 the the thing uh that was fun I had another one where

00:32:03.14 like a few days after we're texting where he was like yeah I had to delete a

00:32:07.00 comment uh from our Facebook because they were like cursing and stuff and

00:32:10.11 talking about the Vancouver child kicker like well I don't know what that is

00:32:14.12 and then having to explain the downside is that the other associations are out

00:32:17.23 of context and horrendous can I just take a second to speak to it to our

00:32:21.12 wonderful audience be very kind audience to my hubby's

00:32:25.12 bagels and all businesses if you're if you're speaking on them uh to them on

00:32:30.17 behalf of face uh we are a wholesome podcast we are about uplifting and and

00:32:35.19 and uh shining a light on local businesses and

00:32:39.11 supporting them not deriding them in any way so let's make sure that we're any

00:32:43.22 interactions we have with uh any bagel company that we like or any coffee

00:32:48.12 company for that matter let's make sure they're positive yeah and it's important

00:32:51.17 to also remember that anyone we talk about or mention they didn't necessarily

00:32:56.19 choose to be mentioned by us absolutely yes

00:32:59.22 yeah I felt I felt they I've tripped into their world but it ended up being

00:33:04.19 like great they're the most wonderful people their food is absurdly good their

00:33:08.22 cream cheese is ridic it's all it's all some of like the best food I've ever had

00:33:12.22 like genuinely it's incredible well that's good it would it would it would

00:33:17.14 have sucked if we had to pretend to like this it would have

00:33:23.02 it would have been a problem [Applause]

00:34:34.09 physical symptoms like headaches teeth grinding and even digestive issues can

00:34:37.21 be indicators of stress now let's not forget about doom scrolling sleeping too

00:34:41.17 little sleeping too much under eating and overeating uh my personal experience

00:34:46.03 with stress I'm sure it's very similar to many people like there's always

00:34:50.23 different stresses in your life whether it be financial work family

00:34:56.13 all sort of I feel relatable complex issues that are stressful in so many ways

00:35:02.12 to so many varying degrees as well stress shows up in all kinds of ways and

00:35:06.12 in a world that's telling you to do more

00:35:08.13 sleep less and grind all the time here's your reminder to take care of yourself

00:35:14.04 do less and maybe try some therapy all great things to consider it's so easy to

00:35:19.06 burn out or stretch yourself too thin and there are real consequences to doing

00:35:24.21 those things at least in my personal experience I know with stress especially

00:35:29.08 there are times where I've been dealing with certain things that have felt so

00:35:32.23 overwhelming and also trying to fight against those feelings of by talking to

00:35:37.12 them with friends or family that is burning them in some way which it never

00:35:41.09 is like it's you're never burned to discuss your feelings with people but

00:35:45.07 that is an area in which I found therapy to be

00:35:48.15 super helpful is just being able to talk about these things and not just

00:35:53.05 live with them kind of eating at me internally it's just so much healthier

00:35:57.14 to go through that process everybody has different things they'll work for them

00:36:00.19 but therapy is the thing that has been super helpful to me better help is a

00:36:04.17 customized online therapy that offers video phone and even live chat sessions

00:39:19.12 the coffee I don't know if we could put a link or something to the coffee they

00:39:23.13 sell or whatever I have their blend I'm about to try this is my do you have

00:39:28.13 any any tips well first off let's read the notes on

00:39:31.04 the coffee what kind of will it tell me about the flavor that's a that's a great

00:39:35.00 that's a great question I should have I don't have the bag with me you think I

00:39:39.22 would do that uh it's uh give me a second I'll pull I'll pull it

00:39:43.19 up I put sugar in it I bought one of those custom pods that you could put in

00:39:48.02 a keurig still still keurig coffee well what's a custom

00:39:52.14 like you make your own pot yeah yeah like it's a reusable pod where you can

00:39:56.08 grind coffee beans because it's a bean based coffee so grounded the beans up

00:40:02.00 and uh put it in porter filter almost yeah exactly did you just did you just

00:40:07.14 say it's a bean based coffee well you know like it's it's

00:40:11.18 is it missed that completely am I am I [ __ ] stupid or is that is that are you

00:40:15.15 is it all coffee bean based I don't buy coffee I'm assuming there are some

00:40:19.23 coffees you can buy that are pre-grind that are already grinded for you I don't

00:40:25.12 know if that's a thing from beans yeah it's an unnecessary I meant un not

00:40:29.08 grinded is what I was going for they sent you ground by the way they sent you

00:40:34.06 full beans and then you had to grind them down yes okay exactly

00:40:39.12 Eric is big into grinding to eliminate any confusion this coffee does come from

00:40:44.16 coffee beans this is the most insane conversation like this is f I'm I'm like

00:40:49.16 I'm [ __ ] grinding my teeth listening to it this is nuts

00:40:53.18 I don't I'm not a coffee person I'm trying yeah clearly

00:40:58.15 we can throw some beans in eric's mouth and then he just spits it into the

00:41:04.02 custom carrot cup and we're ready to go uh okay so it's it's a Guatemalan

00:41:09.16 chocolate berry is okay there is their blend

00:41:13.22 um so it's gonna be chocolaty and fruity yes

00:41:17.11 it's a chocolatey fruity that sounds good it's pretty good pretty good I put

00:41:22.21 a little bit of sugar in nothing else I didn't get crazy just a

00:41:25.17 little bit no cream no milk nothing like that just sugar and coffee no cream no

00:41:30.21 chow mein just champagne no no ramen noodles nothing like that

00:41:35.11 you're okay okay I'm gonna I'm gonna take a sip this is a big moment of I'm

00:41:39.00 like I'm actually trying real coffee this is a documented moment of my life

00:41:44.08 I want you to like it too I want you to become a coffee I wanna like like Eric

00:41:50.04 it smells great and it takes it that's actually really good

00:41:54.06 yeah yeah I could get I could get into this

00:41:56.22 that's that's not bad at all yeah that's way better than what I made he did

00:42:01.22 pretty there's a probably a reason it's like a

00:42:05.06 multi-multi-billion dollar industry that's delicious what have I I've been

00:42:11.04 [ __ ] up why have I not yeah this is amazing

00:42:14.04 I've been telling you to drink coffee for a very long time it's [ __ ]

00:42:17.12 amazing this is very good I think I think we could potentially talk to them

00:42:23.14 about um being nanaimo's exclusive bovril vendor as well.

00:42:33.09 I don't think nanaimo needs that I think we got enough no it's it's cold there

00:42:38.16 sometimes right uh yeah no it gets cold do you look a cup of bobrow in the snow

00:42:44.04 oh amazing oh while we're while we're watching our hockey team go dudes.

00:42:48.19 [Laughter]

00:42:49.23 Blue owl coffee roasters in the naimo Vancouver island it's a cute logo it's a

00:42:54.08 very cute logo very happy owl he looks wise but whimsical at the same time

00:42:59.13 I'll actually lead to the blind but yeah that that's been I'm in the process of

00:43:03.12 finalizing the regulation bagel their food is amazing if you're ever in the

00:43:07.11 area I'd highly recommend checking out my hubby's bagels they're delicious

00:43:13.09 well I gotta say Andrew on a scale of uh salad creaming

00:43:17.01 to ten I give you a tin on drinking that coffee thank you I'm glad

00:43:21.07 it's terrifying like there's a weird pressure with

00:43:23.20 because they're so sweet and I wanted to

00:43:25.16 like accurately represent all this stuff

00:43:28.02 yeah you don't wanna you don't wanna lie right no absolutely not you gotta you

00:43:31.16 gotta stay true to yourself yeah and just also just like describing it poorly

00:43:34.23 or like I don't know it feels I'm okay making myself look like a total idiot

00:43:39.14 they don't deserve that the stakes are higher when other people are involved

00:43:43.19 yeah that's really good I'm injuring more of this coffee you should drink it

00:43:48.13 every day until you die like most people I have a quick question about um

00:43:53.07 urinal etiquette or urinal etiquette okay if you say you've got like a bank of

00:43:59.04 five pisses right and you've got a guy on the left one where do you go

00:44:04.01 the rightmost uh yes that's correct right the wait the

00:44:08.07 one well is it now it depends is it a stranger or is it you because if I walk

00:44:11.18 into a urinal and you're pissing I'm getting as close to you as possible to

00:44:15.16 me that's true no it's a stranger okay okay furthest right

00:44:19.02 and then the next person goes middle and then the next person who comes in

00:44:23.11 has a real evaluation they need to make that's where the choice gets tough once

00:44:28.04 there's three people in the stall I have switched up my urinal etiquette what

00:44:34.04 okay well I was I was pissing at the alamo the other day and um what movie uh

00:44:39.20 what did I watch everything everywhere all at once oh uh you're in that

00:44:44.13 apparently I don't know oh I gave them a clip yeah but it's you're

00:44:49.07 even in the summer guys in the credits that's very cool buddy congratulations

00:44:52.21 nice though um there was a that was five

00:44:56.22 and just a big old puddle of piss under the the right most three so I thought I

00:45:02.22 could either stand in all the piss or I could stand at the one that's right next

00:45:07.05 to the guy on the left yeah yeah and I went for it I thought

00:45:10.06 you know what I'm going to stand on dry ground and piss right next to this guy

00:45:13.21 and I think he may have been confused but what would you do in that situation

00:45:18.02 I mean I think you're a lunatic immediately it's my initial response really

00:45:23.04 yeah I have a lot of questions because there are a lot of variables to this

00:45:26.19 that may change my opinion on what you're talking about how badly did you

00:45:30.02 need to pee was there no ability to hold well I don't think I need it that bad

00:45:33.06 but you know you get that thing when you're when you're in eye shot of a

00:45:37.12 toilet you just absolutely yeah it was it was on the brink I was it

00:45:40.16 was coming I get it yeah there's no hold with me once I enter the bathroom

00:45:44.04 there's we gotta it's going there's no but I thought you know I don't need to

00:45:48.13 conform to this social norm over getting my shoes covered in

00:45:52.23 loads of piss see this is this is where I think there's two layers to this it's

00:45:58.20 not I think a social norm as much as it is a basic decency

00:46:02.23 someone would still stand if there were four people at the other five sure

00:46:07.18 someone would go there so it's not like an insane move it's it's a normal move

00:46:13.13 under different circumstances yeah it's I think it's I understand what you're

00:46:17.03 saying my other question would be are there toilets in that bathroom

00:46:21.18 like were there stools yes were there available stalls uh yeah but you know

00:46:26.12 you're uh you've lost

00:46:32.12 you got to touch what do you mean you got to touch a seat toilet like public

00:46:36.14 toilets don't have seats what are you talking about not a touch of flusher

00:46:39.18 then I don't know I didn't go in there damn the public toilets have seats you

00:46:42.18 gotta leave what are you talking about yeah well there's like the seat you sit

00:46:47.05 on but not the cover seat yeah but what if it was up well

00:46:51.16 why wouldn't that was down at me well he's gotta be precise you don't

00:46:55.01 wanna um that's rude smells small well what are you what are you doing in this

00:46:58.13 situation then Andrew I'm definitely going to the the toilet I'm not going to

00:47:03.12 stand next to here I would do one of two things

00:47:07.05 the stores are gone there's no stores okay yeah there are no stalls and I'm

00:47:10.13 I'm as I'm I'm matching your level of need to pee but I can hold it for a

00:47:15.12 little bit I'm okay I'm not gonna explode the only scenario in which I'm

00:47:19.08 I'm using the urinal next to the guy is if I'm going to explode so you're gonna

00:47:24.09 well I guess this is very fitting of piss boy you're gonna stand there and

00:47:27.11 watch a guy piss no no this is what I'm gonna do I'm gonna go to the sink and

00:47:31.17 I'm gonna like wash my hands I'm gonna do something I'm gonna pretend that I

00:47:35.06 have busy work to do at the sink you're gonna pre-wash your hands I mean I get

00:47:39.08 it you don't want to touch your dick with dinner I need to do something in

00:47:42.08 that room so I'm not just waiting as Gavin said just watching this guy

00:47:46.04 waiting to finish I would I would go to the sink and I would kill some time for

00:47:50.17 a minute I'd wash my hands I'd probably really need to pee and there's an uh

00:47:54.04 there's open there's four open urinals yeah I mean I'm saying in case of in an

00:47:59.08 event of an emergency I completely understand why you did what you did but

00:48:04.21 outside of that I would never do that Gavin I'm gonna I'm gonna say

00:48:10.02 that I think what you did was a hundred percent correct and I would have done

00:48:14.19 the same thing the idea the idea I'm not

00:48:18.10 at a point in my life where I wanna hold where I wanna I want to I want to hold

00:48:24.00 back and create discomfort in my own body to make it convenient for somebody

00:48:28.00 else and I can like the idea of standing in somebody else's stale piss makes me

00:48:32.06 want to vomit I sit crisscross applesauce most of my life I'm sitting

00:48:36.16 crisscross applesauce right now and basically

00:48:39.14 that's that's just asking to get dirty pee on the sides of your legs I couldn't

00:48:43.07 do it so I would and I'm not and I'm not gonna

00:48:46.08 I assume I don't know who this [ __ ]

00:48:49.08 person is and I'll never in my life see this person again

00:48:52.20 probably so I'm gonna go up and I'm gonna stand next to them and I'm gonna

00:48:56.04 use the urinal that's there to be used interesting what about Eric I just use

00:49:01.03 the urinal just pissed just what are we doing which one though

00:49:05.17 far right like it at that point you're gonna stand in pitch stand in the piss

00:49:10.01 it doesn't matter you're it's hey I don't know how clean you think the rest

00:49:13.19 of the bathroom is but it's not that's a great point it's cleaner than standing

00:49:18.06 in a standing wedding then spread your feet a little bit for like

00:49:22.12 to me it's like you're going in the bathroom already don't intentionally

00:49:26.07 step in the piss there's a way to stand where you're not stepping directly in

00:49:30.10 the piss but but to get so hung up about like

00:49:33.15 I don't I don't know if I'm gonna go walk over there bro where do you think

00:49:37.07 you are what do you think has happened in that bathroom because it's been way

00:49:41.12 worse than that I like the idea of doing like a trick

00:49:44.06 shot like standing behind the p yeah he's getting no he's turning into a

00:49:48.01 [ __ ] contortionist trying to do like complicated moves I'll just take two

00:49:52.04 steps back and rainbow it in you know what I mean it'll just stand just stand

00:49:57.07 next to another human being doing the same thing you're doing

00:50:01.12 the piss in from a distance to just piss

00:50:04.05 in a clean urinal yeah you know you just yeah you just arc it stand on my toes

00:50:09.07 lean back a little you know just if I was pissing on the far left

00:50:13.14 and then I just saw a load of piss land in the urinal

00:50:17.12 without seeing the guy I'd be like this is way worse than a guy kissing you know

00:50:23.05 I take my pants all the way down to my ankles and then I just I arc it back and

00:50:29.01 I rainbow it in can you imagine you're just peeing at

00:50:31.20 the urinal and you turn to your right and somebody's being held up like

00:50:35.09 [ __ ] simba pissing into the urinal at a distance

00:50:42.08 yeah you just just go to the clean toilet and pee next to the guy yeah I

00:50:47.09 thought I didn't really make a it wasn't really a huge

00:50:50.07 decision time but it was a little bit of a dilemma in my head and I and it was a

00:50:53.20 slightly guilty piss one of my guiltier pisses that I've had when you go let me

00:50:57.07 ask you a question cause I was thinking about this the other day we were in uh

00:51:01.07 [ __ ] where were we gav I think we were at the event in san Francisco and I was

00:51:06.11 peeing in the bat one of the bathrooms there and there were a row of your

00:51:09.23 urinals I almost said it the weird way you do there were a row of urinals

00:51:14.00 and uh and I went to the I was like the closest one to the door

00:51:17.05 was the you know was to the left and then there were like five or six that

00:51:20.11 went all the way to the right and it was

00:51:22.07 kind of like dark and out of the way the far right one and I I was wondering to

00:51:27.11 myself I wonder if you could see urinal usage over time like has the far

00:51:32.07 left one has this been peed in one million times but the far right we've

00:51:36.10 been peed in 45 times like I want to see the heat map

00:51:40.06 yeah the heat map that's great absolutely the halo heat map I want to

00:51:44.05 see the halo bungee heat map of like how people piss

00:51:48.02 and which stalls are just getting hammered which are relatively use you

00:51:53.04 know just use-free yeah it's got to be the left one I feel like in an

00:51:56.22 English-speaking country you've you start left like you'd read a book I

00:52:01.16 think everyone goes to that one on a completely empty set oh okay for me it's

00:52:06.01 actually dependent on where the door is I want to be pissing as far away from

00:52:10.13 the entrance as possible oh interesting okay yeah I want space I want space and

00:52:15.12 I feel like I'm freeing up all the lanes

00:52:17.08 for anybody who comes in after me what I

00:52:19.08 feel like you don't get as quite as much in this country is just the big piss

00:52:23.01 troughs no football stadium you get those a lot at uh

00:52:28.17 at like venues where you go to see bands

00:52:32.12 like like uh bars like if you go to emos you're pissing in a trough probably in

00:52:36.23 Austin uh or if you go to like some sporting events I've definitely been to

00:52:40.13 some football games where you just like I went to see the lions and I'm pretty

00:52:44.02 sure uh people just straight trough pissing in that one if I remember

00:52:49.07 and that's even worse because they just pour a bunch of ice into the trough so

00:52:54.12 you're like pissing hot piss on ice and watching like it's a good game isn't it

00:53:01.01 piss missed yeah they make steam sometimes yeah it makes you're in scheme

00:53:05.02 and you're just breathing some guys piss next to you like the worst survivor

00:53:09.14 challenge ever to get immunity this week one block of ice per side [Laughter]

00:53:18.04 do you think you could piss if you had like an ice cube say the size of a mug

00:53:23.12 could you piss a hole straight through it

00:53:27.22 my gut says yes but I have nothing to back that on I drink a lot of water

00:53:34.00 every day I feel like I pee enough that I could do some damage to that oh cause

00:53:39.11 isn't that the purpose of the ice actually isn't that to prevent steam

00:53:42.11 like it stops the steam on a cold day what's the point of ice I I think it

00:53:47.20 knocks the smell down to cool it and knock the heat smell down piss

00:53:52.08 piss smells worse the hotter it is yeah.

00:53:55.11 I bet I could piss through a mug yeah what about like one of those giant

00:54:00.02 circular well hold on do you do now do you care

00:54:03.22 because I could freeze up a mug real fast do you care to place a wager on

00:54:08.13 that like what would you do if uh what are you prepared to to bet uh

00:54:13.12 yeah I just it's a volume thing for me I'm not sure my blood is

00:54:16.21 I don't think because I don't think you can do it I think it would I think it

00:54:20.10 would melt far too slowly yeah I've thought of the times you pour like you

00:54:24.02 turn on the hot tap on ice and it does take quite a while doesn't it yeah it

00:54:27.16 does it does I feel like much like burgers

00:54:30.17 like a half second into your piss you would realize like

00:54:34.22 I've made a terrible switch yeah that'd be interesting though what if we

00:54:39.09 had when we all meet up we'll get four frozen mugs and we see

00:54:43.08 we'll stick a stick into the dent that you made and measure see who went the

00:54:47.22 furthest in who has the hottest piss will it be piss boy or will it be one of

00:54:51.13 his friends or co-workers

00:54:57.09 now that's interesting if we do a temperature test and see who's got the

00:55:02.00 hottest piss yeah because one of us will have hotter piss than the other oh

00:55:08.00 guaranteed guaranteed well we need three thermometers

00:55:10.12 and uh we might as well get to fill up some mugs with ice too

00:55:14.05 thank you needs to get off this [ __ ]

00:55:17.09 [ __ ]

00:55:18.11 What is craig's problem today he heard about all this piss talk and he

00:55:22.15 wanted out of here but nick dragged him back kicking it do you have a problem

00:55:26.03 with the piss content in this episode Eric I don't personally have a problem

00:55:30.12 with the piss content but I am thinking about how we're supposed to sponsor a

00:55:34.19 junior hockey team and this is a very pissed episode

00:55:38.08 well maybe this isn't the episode we show them oh and and Geoff which episode

00:55:43.20 do we show them I think we just did all of like the my hubby's bagel thing

00:55:47.17 put it as its own fake length so here oh my god your plan is to show them all

00:55:51.22 this stuff that's just local to your town and then they think it's just like

00:55:55.21 a local podcast I'm trying to think of a whole system then we have the piss

00:55:58.23 review I'm trying to think of what's the most

00:56:01.13 wholesome block it would be interesting to do like an hour of wholesome face

00:56:05.23 what that sounds like and what that is where is that like I don't I'm not sure

00:56:10.09 I'm sure there's enough moments across 98 episodes to do that I just don't know

00:56:15.07 what it would sound like this is heavy piss talk that only

00:56:18.12 potentially half of all people on earth can relate to as well because it's

00:56:22.16 it's male piss talk but we could have female like a a woman could pee through

00:56:26.19 a mug yeah but it you know the the urinal

00:56:30.01 etiquette doesn't come into play that's just unrelated it's true totally true

00:56:34.08 totally true I wonder how ah man it's too bad we

00:56:37.06 don't do we don't have guests or interviews on those podcasts I'd love to

00:56:41.03 interview uh a female about how what the etiquette's

00:56:44.16 like in in women's bathrooms I I mean you can just I mean do that I

00:56:49.16 don't see what I don't like like there has to be a precedent for this on this

00:56:54.23 [ __ ] show I don't know that you need a structure of a show to

00:56:59.14 have that conversation you could just get that info yeah

00:57:03.08 absolute operation like we need to find ourselves a female to talk

00:57:07.21 well I mean this episode is about bovril

00:57:11.01 you can do whatever the [ __ ] you want in this show I guess that's true yeah

00:57:14.19 I don't know if I care that much

00:57:20.06 oh man the bottle saga who saw that coming I

00:57:24.23 didn't know it existed Andrew you should go across the street and see if they

00:57:30.08 they have any I should actually should look yeah I'll go to that store

00:57:34.06 I'll look it up.

00:57:36.19 I don't think there's a thing I would enjoy less and paste

00:57:41.07 like if you gave me an option of putting a thing in paste

00:57:45.18 meat would be pretty low-tier it's just like an edible thing yeah me and fish

00:57:50.06 I can't think of anything else that you when I googled it there's images of it

00:57:54.21 being spread on toast and also images of

00:57:57.05 people drinking it I can't think of many

00:57:58.22 products where it's a spread engine yeah I don't think I've ever had like the

00:58:01.21 both real spread okay we're talking poverty again I tuned out for a second

00:58:05.09 and then we were talking about putting piss on toast okay got it

00:58:11.07 you got to melt the butter some way Geoff oh man

00:58:16.06 well I think I'm both rolled out I don't think I have any more butter or content

00:58:20.23 do you guys uh here's a question for you because uh we're about to record and

00:58:24.07 we're about to record episode 99 we're about to jump right into it do you guys

00:58:27.14 have stuff for it if you guys got any [ __ ] you want to talk about 99 I have a

00:58:31.09 little thing I I've something I want to talk about in this episode that I just I

00:58:36.00 remembered that we should absolutely what I have stuff for next episode

00:58:39.23 uh I know this is a tiny thing just [ __ ] calm down Eric you're gonna see

00:58:43.16 this but this one's no because this happens all the time no I understand

00:58:49.05 specifically with you that's fair I hear you this is a tiny thing it's

00:58:52.15 going to fit it's not tiny but it'll fit

00:58:54.19 within this the the significance of it I

00:58:57.01 want to thank everybody that put us into

00:58:59.11 Reddit place that was really cool to see oh [ __ ]

00:59:02.17 there's a whole thing that was going on I wasn't as involved with it as I'd like

00:59:06.18 to be Reddit place was this I I don't even know if necessarily I'm qualified

00:59:10.11 to explain it if if I say this wrong if you know more feel free to correct me it

00:59:14.00 is a thing that Reddit brought back for April fools it was like this giant wall

00:59:18.15 where people could submit tiles of colors and make art on it but you can

00:59:22.17 only do it once every five minutes and it was this board that had limited

00:59:26.13 spaces so people were like fighting for spaces it got strangely political where

00:59:30.18 like from what I could tell the thing they made they made alliances with the

00:59:34.19 halo people and the doom people and like another subreddit like it was Poland

00:59:39.10 ball people I think as well yeah I think Poland was involved like it's this very

00:59:44.08 interesting thing that is awesome in the sense of it it makes other communities

00:59:49.09 that would never interact become friends and kind of unite over a period of time

00:59:53.06 and uh face was on I should have grabbed the screens hot of our

00:59:57.04 place oh that'd be if you could post it that'd be awesome but I just wanted to

01:00:00.13 thank all the people that spent it was like a three or four day thing where

01:00:04.06 like they had to rally and fight people against like defend the space

01:00:07.14 is very cool yeah I was um I wasn't like in the discord discussing it and all

01:00:11.17 that [ __ ] but I was it was when we were on tour Gavin and so I had it up on my

01:00:16.06 phone the entire time we were on tour and I was helping defend not only face I

01:00:20.18 was also helping defend red versus blue and ruby because they were on there as

01:00:24.23 well and uh it was so much fun it was like I had alerts set up so that every

01:00:28.13 five minutes my phone would ding and it would remind me to go like put another

01:00:31.20 tile down because there was a couple there was like a full two days there

01:00:33.22 where people were just trying to [ __ ]

01:00:36.23 with rvb and I was like trying to hold that back but

01:00:39.15 the face community was was awesome they were really cool it was wonderful all

01:00:44.04 the people that did that thank you so much

01:00:46.04 it was funny too because I I didn't so I

01:00:48.05 was sort of like you Geoff where I was in and out of it I didn't really know what

01:00:51.12 was going on they added so we had a border where it

01:00:55.03 said the name of our show and then it was surrounded by pencils and then they

01:00:58.20 added another pencil and so I looked at it and I was like oh that pencil has

01:01:02.21 like it's missing a piece I have a tile I'll put the piece back so I put it back

01:01:07.00 what I didn't realize is that that pencil was made against an alliance I

01:01:11.05 think was Poland it went against the polish alliance yeah and so they're

01:01:15.04 trying to get rid of the pencil and I had just further stated it and then

01:01:18.17 people were like well andrew's building the pencil like [ __ ] the alliance like

01:01:22.10 we got to keep I accidentally created all this conflict because I'm dumb and

01:01:26.04 so then I had to step in and be like no just get rid of the follow the alliances

01:01:30.10 I don't know anything either you trying to accidentally invaded Poland I

01:01:35.03 accidentally led a charge in continuing to invade Poland

01:01:39.05 historically a bad move yeah not great the and I I will say that the

01:01:42.22 final form of the face was the face logo with the pencil border and then one

01:01:47.10 giant pencil with the bite taken out of it and I thought that was phenomenal

01:01:51.14 very funny very good very good it was nice to see a lot of uh
