00:00:18.15 [Music]

00:00:23.23 [Music]

00:00:26.17 [Applause]

00:00:31.05 Has there been a big appearance by heroin since breaking bad and that arc

00:00:36.20 was heroin a big part of breaking bad no I think it was math I'm not saying the

00:00:41.16 drug he made I'm we're talking about heroin uh and uh

00:00:45.13 jesse's girlfriend and Jessie got they were super into heroin for like a season

00:00:50.15 and then she dies at the overdose oh yeah uh [ __ ]

00:00:54.05 krista ritter yeah the marvel character right

00:00:57.15 yeah yeah Chris Kristen ritter yeah that's like maybe the best scene in that

00:01:01.19 show well I think that scene is like really that's where everything's

00:01:06.10 different like that's that's a very like easy marked emotionally like that whole

00:01:10.10 show that is a huge moral turning point right there yeah where where you're like

00:01:15.10 you're rooting and you can root but then that happens and you go oh not the

00:01:19.14 character that I thought this was and then that that's really where the show I

00:01:22.22 don't think you're wrong I just wouldn't have instinctually thought that I

00:01:26.05 wouldn't have even put that my top 10 of memorable breaking bad moments hmm oh I

00:01:30.07 just think I just think that's where the show we took him breaking bad

00:01:34.11 well I guess he did yeah it's just right

00:01:36.09 yeah yeah what are you talking about the

00:01:38.09 heroine I said maybe like the one of the

00:01:40.03 like the best moment of that [ __ ] like the show where

00:01:44.02 it marks a real turning point is when he watches when

00:01:47.03 Walt watches uh jesse's girlfriend die from heroin like she has like an

00:01:50.10 overdose she's [ __ ] like choking and he just like lets her die because that's

00:01:55.18 for purely for personal gain and it to me really marks a shift in that

00:02:00.06 show and yeah shift in the objective as well as him mowing that guy down and

00:02:04.04 then shooting him in the head was also like a okay he's he's all the way yeah

00:02:09.14 he's all in I think like the first moment for that

00:02:12.04 with me is when he chokes the guy out in the basement with the thing and he's

00:02:15.12 like trying to stab him with the play like it's just so messy and like it's

00:02:19.14 such a you cannot come back from this moment there's no reversing at this

00:02:23.13 point you are gone down a path I was talking about Gavin to nick how I feel you

00:02:28.15 gave one of the worst takes I've ever heard and I'd forgotten all about it

00:02:35.02 which led to a heroin.

00:02:38.05 [Laughter]

00:02:48.08 Yeah we typically we always do we it's not an episode if we don't start it

00:02:54.00 right we always we pride ourselves on yeah we must only have like 26 episodes

00:03:00.08 that's a great question like how many intros have we done

00:03:05.03 hello and welcome to another episode of face my name is Geoff Ramsey and with me

00:03:10.19 as always Andrew panton from Canada and uh Gavin free from england

00:03:15.12 uh and then also somewhere back there uh

00:03:18.12 nick and Eric are giving each other hand

00:03:21.03 jobs while we talk this is episode 76 go where is nick from I know where Eric is

00:03:26.09 from at least I feel like I do Santa okay hey there we go why did we do the

00:03:30.16 locations Geoff what was what's the inspiration for that today I think it's

00:03:33.21 interesting I think it's the most interesting thing about either of you

00:03:37.00 really the the place yeah I can get I can get down I can I can set a tone

00:03:40.10 immediately now people people know something about you that it instantly

00:03:44.23 points uh I mean it's pretty clear that I'm from

00:03:47.19 america based on my brash uh manner of speaking uh an accent uh but then now

00:03:52.12 they immediately put a frame in their head they see a triangle of england

00:03:55.22 in the united states a great English-speaking triangle I feel like

00:03:59.12 the england the england part is obvious the the Canadian aspect of the show is

00:04:04.08 less obvious I'll be honest with you Gavin I don't know that you're

00:04:08.23 this podcast takes place in america uh mostly where and uh I would say that

00:04:13.01 well I am excited to report we have a global audience I would say a large

00:04:17.04 portion of our audience is america and to your average American Australians

00:04:21.16 brits and south africans all are kind of interchangeable uh-huh I don't

00:04:26.13 I don't think that's true in terms of access yeah yeah yeah

00:04:30.08 there's a lot of Americans that could not tell you if their life depended on

00:04:33.08 it the difference between a south African or a British accent

00:04:37.03 yeah I would agree eric's bat eric's backing me up in the in the comments

00:04:42.05 I I agree too they're very simple they're not like

00:04:46.05 once you know the difference you know you know like I feel like charlton

00:04:49.23 copely was a really big deal for this south African accent I feel like that

00:04:53.21 really highlighted it outside of that I can't think of anybody who is like

00:04:58.01 popular actor-wise that was like south African and like Charlotte

00:05:01.13 is south Africa I know but not I don't I

00:05:03.20 don't feel like she has an accent in the same way

00:05:06.13 not as noticeable to me but maybe I'm just proving the point I can't hear it I

00:05:09.20 don't see it yeah it's like trying to tell difference between Australia and

00:05:13.14 new Zealand it's very similar for us it's it's it's hard to do they are

00:05:17.09 pretty similar Eric says yeah Gavin you sound like tycho ytd to me.

00:05:25.19 [Laughter]

00:05:27.16 [Music]

00:05:29.03 I don't think Kevin saw any of that coming uh we do have a lot to talk about uh

00:05:36.06 just a quick rundown uh we uh Andrew you conducted an experiment you

00:05:42.11 you went up against the Denver night you went up in I guess an entire nba team

00:05:47.12 one of the better definitely a top 12 team uh in the nba

00:05:52.08 reigning mvp uh plays for that team and you took them on uh without four friends

00:05:56.11 but by yourself then uh I uh the other one Gavin and I we threw

00:06:00.07 baseballs so we got all that to talk about uh I would also like to mention

00:06:03.22 that uh we just talked about Gavin had his first

00:06:07.12 route 44 uh and that was a very exciting and hilarious experience uh that we

00:06:12.14 should also get it to as well and maybe he can even share the video with you

00:06:15.22 guys although I doubt he'll put it online I what is a route 44

00:06:20.04 that's what I thought we should get to it in the in the

00:06:23.16 natural course of things so I think we should start with the nuggets are we

00:06:27.23 doing chocolate today oh right oh we got

00:06:30.02 chocolate today holy [ __ ] [ __ ] shot we

00:06:33.12 have too much mention that Andrew moved the recording it's it was a rare one for

00:06:37.07 Andrew he was feeling a bit poorly uh yeah but totally blue balls to me for

00:06:42.14 what's it been four days five days I apologize I think it's funny I don't

00:06:46.19 worry about it I was just I'm really really excited about the chocolate

00:06:50.11 I gotta say the the the temperature on social chocolate confidence is through

00:06:55.00 the roof amongst the audience the comment levers are all independently

00:06:58.22 working they're up working up their chocolate tolerance to build their

00:07:02.14 confidence I'm amazed at how well this is like the people have latched on I'm

00:07:06.17 honestly blown away like the just just from what I've seen on the Instagram

00:07:10.15 stories the uh face Instagram stories everyone has been buying this chocolate

00:07:15.07 I can't imagine like that being like an ad read I spent like 10 minutes [ __ ]

00:07:20.23 on how bad that chocolate was and it's caused so many sales I'm blown away by

00:07:25.01 it I'm so excited I I almost bought some just because I saw it at the store

00:07:30.01 and I went oh there's the chocolate I should get no wait I'm not doing this

00:07:34.00 [ __ ] them but you didn't buy it no because it's not my it's not my

00:07:37.22 content no that's fair that's fair we'll see how I feel after I mean we have

00:07:42.04 there's another thing that I I think you guys probably possibly even forgot were

00:07:46.20 prototypes you wanted a prototype I've got mine ready oh yeah you got you guys

00:07:50.15 ready I filmed a video oh this is this is very

00:07:54.13 exciting did you do one Audrey oh I you you bet I did I got I'm wearing mine

00:07:58.12 right now we have so much going on I got my prototype going right now what do we

00:08:02.00 want to start with here's the thing we have too much episode we can't

00:08:06.03 we can't get all this into one episode we might as well just acknowledge that

00:08:09.02 and admit we're going to have to cut some of this stuff and move it to

00:08:12.13 thursday's recording oh for sure uh what do we want to talk about the most

00:08:16.14 because we should do that now I think the the nuggets are probably the most

00:08:19.16 time sensitive I think the nuggets is a thing to mention I I feel like we kind

00:08:23.21 of talked a bit already do we just go into gavin's worst take of all time go

00:08:28.00 for it so I turn my phone on Saturday like 6 p.m

00:08:31.14 my time having a great day so weird what's weird everything you just said

00:08:36.17 was weird I turned my phone on is weird 6 p.m is weird okay listen I'm not funny

00:08:44.17 my phone does not own me Geoff okay my phone died the previous evening okay

00:08:51.16 I'm not a big phone guy not a big phone guy don't use it all that much don't

00:08:56.23 need it really didn't expect anything on it

00:09:00.04 it was back of my mind all day I was having the greatest [ __ ] day it was

00:09:04.18 sunny out it started because we were doing we were doing baseball stuff we

00:09:09.18 were talking about the baseball plan and Andrew just chimes in 6 p.m on Saturday

00:09:13.20 turning my phone on to these texts it's like waking up to Christmas morning

00:09:18.11 immediately I did I was not interested in the baseball stuff anymore I just

00:09:22.00 wrote who turns on their phone at 600

00:09:23.22 p.m okay so here's the problem when my phone

00:09:27.03 turns on and I get text messages it tells me when it turned on not when they

00:09:30.14 were sent so I have no point of reference for when your conversation happened

00:09:35.12 I didn't know there was any baseball talk to be had end of day charge you my

00:09:39.14 phone I'm like I'll I'll turn it on I'll just check see what's going on if I got

00:09:43.12 any messages I get all those genuinely was so excited I didn't know the

00:09:47.01 baseball throw was happening didn't expect it it was as I said it was like

00:09:51.13 waking up not knowing it was Christmas morning and they're all these gifts as

00:09:56.17 messages of this throws happening I'm now excited for the next day I was

00:10:02.00 trying to just share my enthusiasm with the two of you of how excited I was we

00:10:07.03 jumped down your throat immediately I I Gavin replies I don't know why I'm

00:10:10.20 saying this you should say you're the one who sent it this is done by me to

00:10:14.12 interject would you want me to read out just this brief part yeah go ahead

00:10:18.19 I said who turns on their phone at 6pm you just you said I just did I said that

00:10:23.22 is the most disturbing thing ever like you just came off a heroine bender you

00:10:27.15 said what I said you heard you said you are ridiculous

00:10:31.07 this might be the worst take you have ever had

00:10:34.12 I don't understand why that's weird I don't use my phone a lot I have no point

00:10:39.18 of using the phone well firstly who turns off a phone to be honest

00:10:45.03 smart phone it died it died I didn't turn it off it died as a

00:10:49.20 battery life you're in your what late 20s how do you have no

00:10:53.09 responsibilities anywhere that you could just sit with your phone off all day

00:10:57.21 what if there's an emergency I'd find out the following day listen I have an

00:11:02.04 email there are ways you can reach me if you

00:11:06.04 need to reach me I just am not a big phone guy I get very few calls

00:11:10.00 almost no texts can I ask you a question yeah does uh does Raymond so mayor turn

00:11:14.20 his phone off as well or does that one stay on I was always on

00:11:19.09 that's an always-on point it looks as though Eric doesn't agree with you Eric

00:11:24.21 it's a terrible take I don't I just don't understand how that's the worst

00:11:29.14 take that Gavin can have okay well I mean like very what's that

00:11:33.09 but he but I agree with him I agree it's like oh it's like you just got off a

00:11:36.14 heroine but there's so many people that I know that are just like yeah I just

00:11:40.12 had a crate like an insane weekend and just on stuff and not wanting to be

00:11:44.12 around their phones so it reads that way to me too so I I don't know I think I

00:11:48.13 suppose I think I just live in a different [ __ ] world I like I'm not

00:11:53.16 I'm not gonna part like you would think I'm on a bender I don't really drink I'm

00:11:58.21 not a party guy at all like I would just never think that so it was insane

00:12:03.12 you also did text in in the same chain because I was on it as well and I have

00:12:07.07 pulled it up you said this seems like a good time to reveal I'm a big heroin guy

00:12:11.15 yeah well I mean that's just a joke because I was I thought this was oh

00:12:15.00 you're not actually yeah I mean no I'm not pointing out too mine was also a

00:12:19.09 joke I actually didn't think you were on heroin all night

00:12:23.18 but it was a weird thing to even apply it

00:12:27.06 yeah imagining someone waking up at six that's that's all I was comparing it to

00:12:31.09 I would I would never well there's no indication I woke up at six like that's

00:12:35.12 a huge leap for me to even like when you

00:12:39.01 say that I got up at like 7 a.m that day I had a full day

00:12:42.23 I just hadn't had my phone on you were up for 11 hours yeah on a Saturday

00:12:47.22 without a phone yeah I mean I think it's awesome people used to do it I used to

00:12:51.21 do it before cell phones yeah uh I just don't remember what it was like in it

00:12:56.03 like how was it it was Saturday like I don't understand like that's what you do

00:12:59.20 what'd you do that day well how did you how did you asked by your 11 hours what

00:13:03.19 did I do on Saturday uh uh [ __ ] what did

00:13:05.21 I had your phone with you you could have taken a photo and then you'd be oh

00:13:10.23 I um I think I'd clean my closet out on Saturday that may have been a Sunday

00:13:16.08 thing yeah I spent a whole day either on Saturday I don't remember this isn't

00:13:21.05 really helping my argument against like it's a pretty uneventful day I think I

00:13:26.10 played games I think I was playing far cry

00:13:28.06 of Saturday it's a good game that far cry yeah it's fine it's another one of

00:13:32.15 those they made a really big deal about gus

00:13:35.07 being in it and he's like barely in it it's fine it's a decent game

00:13:39.11 yeah but uneventful I just thought it was a crazy take maybe I'm wrong maybe I

00:13:43.07 just I'm like so disconnected from like party world that it would never cross my

00:13:48.04 mind I was honestly worried because you reacted so strongly to it I was like oh

00:13:51.12 maybe I've touched on something here maybe you used to be a heroin addict and

00:13:54.19 I've just brought up something that you don't want to talk or like like

00:13:58.02 he had a he had a twin brother who died of a heroin overdose so we just did

00:14:01.16 something like that yeah I'm right there with you see I had

00:14:04.15 a different anxiety approach where I was like I'm very against this take but not

00:14:08.06 really like it's a crazy take in my head

00:14:10.01 but I'm not upset by this in any way but it's just fun to argue in this context

00:14:14.07 I was like I hope you don't think I'm actually mad oh no that was my approach

00:14:17.21 hey you know what I think we covered that topic pretty well do you want to

00:14:22.06 move on to another one no time we got no time okay we're

00:14:25.20 moving right along we're talking about the nuggets yeah let's talk about the

00:14:30.19 nuggets didn't go well didn't win the nugget thing

00:14:35.14 I didn't so we had a plan we talked about recording it in some aspect and uh

00:14:40.23 all I ended up doing was recording an intro for it which I haven't gotten rid

00:14:45.15 of but I was like yeah this is gonna be easy I feel great about this I felt so

00:14:50.01 [ __ ] sick by the end of the first quarter I was going through quarterly

00:14:52.23 updates it's like I just I have no words there's no words for me to say

00:14:56.20 it was brutal uh the time of possession was an issue a thing that I did not

00:15:00.22 consider which was like really like where you got you got to get your

00:15:05.07 nuggets in free throws because Dallas maintains the ball and

00:15:08.09 it's like a long kind of slow stretch that's a good time it's really the pace

00:15:12.12 that gets you is the problem is what I learned well having to stuff them in

00:15:16.20 while your team well the possession yeah like that was the really the really

00:15:20.13 tough part and because you feel like so pressured to like I gotta get more

00:15:25.05 nuggets in at this time there's no break

00:15:27.22 like it's mentally exhausting as well as

00:15:30.13 the physical being full I ate like a box of 20 I want to say in three minutes

00:15:33.22 so should should we point out at this point that

00:15:38.04 that adherence to that rule is all you none of us wanted you to only eat during

00:15:43.22 the Dallas possession we all thought you should eat the whole time well I think

00:15:47.07 it only makes I mean I guess it makes sense to you but you you're making it

00:15:51.03 harder on yourself for no it's all right monumental that's all these hands

00:15:55.20 additional handicap it I just it's the confidence so I

00:15:59.04 believed they didn't think it would be that bad he's Eric with all the skulls

00:16:02.04 on [Laughter]

00:16:04.04 you're doing you're doing lasso nuggets man

00:16:10.12 that's [ __ ] merch

00:16:15.05 nuggets all skulls on

00:16:19.12 we have to set that to the same font and design as the NASA logo [Laughter]

00:16:27.06 [Music]

00:16:29.22 Please please let's make a Nassau [ __ ]

00:16:34.12 speaking of which where's the damn I I I don't want to get off on a tangent but

00:16:39.20 real quick while we're in that part of it uh where's the goddamn go go now

00:16:44.15 uh welcome mat for houses and the go go now shark shirt and weren't we going to

00:16:49.20 make about we have some scheme content jet ski

00:16:56.06 we got I don't know what happened to the I don't know if I should talk about

00:17:00.20 there was a certain uh drinking apparatus that I feel like has been in

00:17:04.01 the works for quite a long time yeah we got to join with that I believe we had a

00:17:08.10 conversation about making ping pong balls that say 19 on them too

00:17:13.05 whatever that I think was what we should do we talked uh there is a mode of

00:17:18.03 transportation that uh is I don't know when that will that will release

00:17:23.07 that's the thing okay so anyway you ate nuggets in the

00:17:27.08 first three minutes I like yeah I like what is your mindset after that like

00:17:31.12 that first 20 nuggets how do you feel uh honestly not too bad so I just want

00:17:36.00 to caveat something I didn't even consider a great part of this currently

00:17:40.10 mcdonald's Canada is doing their monopoly promotion I got so many [ __ ]

00:17:44.16 game pieces every 20 bucks had four the drink had like two I got a few different

00:17:49.09 things I even got a fries I was so confident I'm like ah I'll get a little

00:17:53.05 snack on the side I want some fries down the 20 nuggets I would felt pretty

00:17:58.04 good at that point well I know that because the burgers you said you knew

00:18:02.11 immediately that you're in trouble like did you do 20 nuggets before you

00:18:06.02 realized you're in trouble I was so confident so I first I got like 110

00:18:11.09 nuggets in the first run and then I hand

00:18:14.02 counted each box uh and one of the boxes they gave me 21. I just ate the nugget

00:18:17.14 on the spot I was like I just want a little snack because I was hungry

00:18:20.10 that was the worst part so there are so many strategic mistakes I made one I

00:18:25.05 ordered the nuggets like 45 minutes before tip-off and the game started late

00:18:28.21 so by the time the second quarter rolled around I got cold kind of rubbery

00:18:34.00 nuggets and just texturally it was less a space thing and more of a

00:18:39.03 rhythm of eating with the possession and also just the texture being the same

00:18:45.11 shitty texture on every nugget Eric brought up in the chat a fantastic

00:18:49.01 question of did I use sauce not only did I use sauce okay I went

00:18:53.04 into my own supply I pulled out some of those bts sauces I went through like

00:18:58.13 five or six sweet chili bts sauces it's fantastic

00:19:04.00 Eric what's the game of bar and go oh you were telling people about the nug

00:19:09.04 that was going on the nug challenge I went I was in san Diego for the weekend

00:19:13.16 and we were going to a concert before the concert we went to a bar the bar had

00:19:18.05 the game on and I told everyone about this it was

00:19:21.20 we got to like the third quarter before we had to go and the third quarter felt

00:19:26.01 like that's when they went on a tear and it was like it was just a bar full

00:19:31.06 of people going like oh your poor friend [Laughter]

00:19:34.17 so what was the final what was the final score then I ended up eating 67 nuggets

00:19:40.18 uh and then and that was not enough to beat the Denver nuggets that was not 108

00:19:45.19 uh 106. Yeah the nuggets scored 106. I almost outnuggeted the mavericks who had

00:19:51.20 75. So that legendarily bad game too they did what broke me and I feel like

00:19:57.01 this is just a fascinating because like as a fan you watch and it's

00:20:01.11 heartbreaking sometimes but you don't physically feel

00:20:05.06 the toll of when a team goes on a run in the nba I had like a 14 nugget lead 15

00:20:10.17 nugget league going into the end of the the half like at the end of the second

00:20:16.06 quarter there's like I don't know maybe seven minutes left in it the nuggets

00:20:20.00 went on like a 14-point run where they scored just constantly without pause and

00:20:25.03 it blew my lead I only ended up having a

00:20:27.03 one-nugget advantage at the half I think I had I eaten like 55 and they had

00:20:31.06 scored 54 points or something like that that was demoralizing that was really

00:20:36.13 like the nail in the coffin of I had been eating so quickly

00:20:39.14 with like no pause just trying to get a lead I just mentally needed a little bit

00:20:44.06 of a gap because I knew I'd slow down and the fact that they brought it to

00:20:48.03 within one going into the half and I can't eat nuggets at that point I just

00:20:51.22 have to sit there and be like well I hope Dallas gets the ball or else I'm

00:20:55.17 immediately behind him did you uh at that point like during the half time did

00:20:59.16 you do any kind of like stretching exercises or try to burn any calories or

00:21:03.15 like I don't know move around to kind of adjust the food I'm gonna tell you what

00:21:08.03 I did okay okay this is this is the this is just like a sign of how how dead I

00:21:13.01 was because I think I ate like 55

00:21:15.05 nuggets going into the half and I ended up with 67 nuggets I was just broken by

00:21:19.10 that point didn't eat a lot of nuggets third quarter so in the first half you

00:21:24.08 ate 55 the second half you ate 12. Yeah essentially something like that

00:21:28.02 I uh hit the half I I walked went on a little walk stood

00:21:32.01 outside for a little bit during the break then I grabbed my boxes and nuggets

00:21:36.17 walked into the bathroom just that I spent the end of the game in

00:21:40.21 my bathtub eating the nuggets just demoralized

00:21:44.17 sitting in the dark like two nugget boxes eating when I can

00:21:49.06 are you wearing clothes are you in the bathtub oh no I'm fully in the tub I'm

00:21:54.09 stretched out I'm trying to get as comfy as I can your Xbox live headset

00:22:00.00 no didn't have a headset I was just sitting there I was so sad and like I

00:22:04.19 think I tweeted at the end of the first quarter I'm on I'm on a pace to set an

00:22:10.01 nba scoring record because I need like 26 nuggets because yeah I think well

00:22:14.04 chamberlain scored 100 points I think it's the record for points scored at a

00:22:18.05 game I'm like I'm at 26. I'm feeling great like I'm gonna beat wilt

00:22:21.14 chamberlain and then it just collapsed that second quarter

00:22:25.02 really demoralized I'm worried that you went to the bath because the bath is

00:22:29.07 typically your happy place but I feel like recently it's been where you've had

00:22:32.23 bad news of like the outskirts um level being beat and now it's where you go

00:22:37.01 when you're sad with nugs it was just I needed a place a comfort Gavin I needed

00:22:41.19 refuge and so I grabbed my boxes and I walked in

00:22:45.01 I just slowly ate I was just trying to get numbers I conceded by the middle of

00:22:48.19 the third quarter because I feel like it was just the worst quarter basketball

00:22:53.07 I've seen any team ever play dallas's third quarter was horrendous uh

00:22:58.10 I failed I honestly I'm dumb though like I

00:23:02.00 by Sunday night I was like you know what maybe some strategic adjustments

00:23:07.07 I think I could do this I looked Monday there was a game I was like

00:23:12.09 do I do this again I think monday's too s too soon but I I would imagine you you

00:23:17.09 would have learned enough on the first attempt that you could uh you could

00:23:22.10 you know uh the problem is differently the second

00:23:25.07 time around assuming that this goes the same way as the burger confidence

00:23:28.14 attempt number two will be my best attempt and I would probably eat like 80

00:23:32.04 nuggets at that point which probably still isn't enough

00:23:35.01 and then the third attempt would be the thing that gets me into nugget

00:23:38.02 retirement you just need to be really wise with

00:23:41.20 your second attempt like let's like Jamal Murray is out right now he tore an

00:23:46.17 acl last year I think so that's good for you what you need to do is wait to it

00:23:52.03 like a load management night when they're resting uh

00:23:56.14 the joker and he's not in maybe mpj is like got some calf stiffness or

00:24:01.01 something he's not playing and then you strike that's a game you want to play a

00:24:04.12 game when the nuggets are down two or three of their best offensive players

00:24:08.17 and they're just you know they're just treading water

00:24:11.05 I what honestly the problem was is it looked like the nuggets were gonna score

00:24:14.12 a million points and I would need to order more nuggets and I just didn't

00:24:18.00 have it in me could not get more nuggets delivered that was really a breaking

00:24:21.16 point so nick's right it needs to be against a

00:24:24.16 team with a really good defense as well yeah so I was upset I feel like we

00:24:28.21 should bring this up I learned after the fact I guess before the run

00:24:33.12 so we pushed a recording back because I was sick

00:24:36.00 uh and I found out the next day that Geoff had this whole prank lined up and I

00:24:40.16 put prank in quotations I would have never been happier to get pranked by

00:24:44.20 anybody well I know fantastic so what we were gonna do and I don't

00:24:48.19 think I had actually clued anybody in yet because I wanted everybody to be

00:24:52.02 surprised when it happened and I and I I was actually trying to

00:24:54.21 find your address on my phone when I was reading the slack that we were gonna

00:24:58.08 postpone so the timing was perfect I was going to

00:25:02.04 throughout the day I was thinking like every

00:25:05.18 one hour to 90 minutes I wanted 20 fresh hot mcdonald's chicken nuggets to show

00:25:10.09 up on your front door and definitely during the podcast I wanted to overwhelm

00:25:15.08 you with nuggets leading up to the event because who can

00:25:19.15 say no to nuggets first of all and b I think just having your your entire

00:25:23.16 neighborhood would smell so intensely of nuggets that I thought psychologically

00:25:27.08 it would completely and totally throw you off your game turns out I didn't

00:25:30.23 need to but I really did want to do that I'm really bummed I didn't get to do it

00:25:34.16 I'm bummed too I would have loved to have free nuggets for a day that sounds

00:25:38.12 fantastic it was just like there's gonna be a endless supply are you going to

00:25:42.16 drown in nuggets the day before your nugget competition I don't think they

00:25:46.12 would have done anything either because the next day I finished the nuggets for

00:25:51.05 lunch and like dinner nuggets all the next day I said that in

00:25:55.09 the recording that I don't think we'll do anything with if I was the first of

00:25:59.01 anything for me my first guy thing I was I'm the biggest chicken guy [ __ ] love

00:26:04.10 chicken ever since those little number one food huge chicken guy I did the

00:26:08.21 chicken dinner challenge love chicken can go a whole month just eating chicken

00:26:12.20 no problem it's fantastic is there any chicken in those isn't it all chicken

00:26:17.19 well there's definitely there's some chicken in there for sure

00:26:21.20 do me a favor rank the major meat from best to from favorites least

00:26:26.10 favorite for me it's chicken by like six miles and then whatever else like I'm

00:26:30.13 kind of indifferent to everything else so you're different to like beef and

00:26:35.03 pork like cow I guess like I would go beef too and

00:26:38.12 then pork three but chicken is so far ahead of both of them that it doesn't

00:26:43.01 matter it does it doesn't matter I have a brief question about if you are to

00:26:48.21 tackle this again have you considered just doing it from inside a mcdonald's

00:26:52.17 no can I tell you can I tell you how I thought about salad creaming it though

00:26:57.16 okay I thought about ordering like popcorn chicken from like kfc

00:27:02.04 they're technically nugget they're smaller I could eat 200 of those

00:27:07.05 I bet you I just didn't want to deal with the blow back nugget

00:27:11.16 you don't want nugget blow back no man well I think I think 62 is a is a

00:27:18.20 valiant valiant if 67 sorry 67 is a valiant effort and if you uh if it didn't

00:27:27.11 cause any uh long-term health effects then I think it was a great experiment

00:27:33.08 and I would love to see you try it again uh assuming that it doesn't kill you

00:27:38.09 yeah that's I think realistically maybe way down the road I need to think about

00:27:42.05 it more there needs to be some strategic adjustments could I do it in a

00:27:45.15 mcdonald's does the mcdonald's have wi-fi that's my biggest question

00:27:48.23 definitely of course it will I'm not sure I also think uh oh yeah we should

00:27:53.00 definitely shout that dude out thank you Eric I also think that next time we do

00:27:57.11 it we should do it on mic like this we should just be listening in and having

00:28:00.16 that conversation okay like we can provide moral support well like that

00:28:04.14 face eats [ __ ] yeah face eat [ __ ] right

00:28:06.12 so like when Andrew was doing it but we wouldn't we wouldn't record the game

00:28:09.17 audio or anything but just like this just the game's on in the background and

00:28:13.07 andrew's just eating he's probably not eating into the mic but you know we're

00:28:16.08 we're like hey you one more Andrew you can do it chew harder yeah yeah I think

00:28:21.06 the motivation will help yeah I think so I think so I think

00:28:24.20 that's the way that the other work I think that would be that would be useful

00:28:29.11 I just didn't yeah there was also a guy uh uh on Reddit whose username is

00:28:32.20 chupaloop he uh I guess lives in Denver and he uh is a nuggets fan he went to

00:28:39.01 the game he held up a giant eat the pencil Andrew sign with a big pencil on

00:28:43.16 it he I literally I looked for him all game we never got to see him in this

00:28:48.00 town it was so much fun it was like a second game going on within the game

00:28:52.15 there was so many there were so many nested ways to enter to enjoy this

00:28:56.17 nuggets game uh the one that I was having the most fun with was trying to

00:29:00.10 find this sign uh so to believe that was brilliant he said that um people around

00:29:05.05 him were so confused and kept asking him what the hell the sign was about and he

00:29:08.23 was like you have no idea how hard it is to explain this podcast to people and I

00:29:12.06 was like oh it's my entire career buddy tell me about it but uh yeah it was a

00:29:15.19 very very very funny very funny thing to do and was super appreciated so a hell

00:29:19.18 of a couple I like that Andrea was eating nuggets but the sign said eat the

00:29:23.19 pencil like the pencil still trumps

00:29:27.03 well it's become like it's become a like a phrase that doesn't

00:29:31.20 mean anything anymore it's like hey now eat the pencil you know doesn't mean

00:29:36.00 anything what hey now does it mean anything I feel like no I feel like yeah

00:29:41.18 we're not going to do an old we're not going to do an old Larry sanders show

00:29:46.08 bit but okay the point is it doesn't mean anything [Applause]

00:29:51.18 using the internet without expressvpn is like leaving your keys in your car

00:29:57.09 while you run into a gas station for a snack most of the time you're going to

00:30:02.09 come back and there will be a car there and you will recognize that car is yours

00:30:05.21 but every once in a while like what happened to my friend mike and his dad

00:30:10.00 in high school when they went inside to buy cigarettes uh you'll come out and

00:30:14.17 that car is not there anymore that's what people do to your internet rarely

00:30:18.16 but it happens every time you connect to an unencrypted network cafe a hotel an

00:30:23.18 airport any other place where you would connect

00:30:26.06 to an unencry you know where you connect to unencrypted networks you don't need

00:30:30.00 me to tell you you don't need the list from me

00:30:32.02 any hacker on that network can gain access to your personal data and it

00:30:35.13 doesn't take much technical knowledge to

00:30:37.17 hack someone any smart 12 year old could do it or maybe like a reasonably

00:30:42.00 intelligent 16 year old or a kind of dumb 24 year old your data is valuable

00:30:47.11 hackers can make up to a thousand dollars per person just selling your

00:30:50.17 boring lame data on the dark web that's why you want something like expressvpn

00:30:54.20 it creates a secure encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet not

00:30:59.04 big enough to drive uh not not one of those tunnels that you could drive like

00:31:02.20 a Tesla through but a secure internet tunnel and all of your data going in and

00:31:07.03 out of that tunnel is going to be as safe and as cryptid as you and one of

00:31:11.03 those teslas zipping around under is it las Vegas I

00:31:14.09 think probably it's also super secure it would take a hacker with a super

00:31:18.23 computer over a billion years to get past expressvpn's encryption those are

00:31:22.15 their words not mine I haven't done the math on that I haven't done the ch I

00:31:26.19 will I'm gonna they wrote it down so I'm gonna assume they fact checked it so

00:31:31.01 there you go uh one billion years easy to use you just fire up the app click a

00:31:35.11 button and you get protected and it works everywhere your phone your laptop

00:31:40.06 your tablet yada yada yada that way you can stay secure wherever you go I like

00:31:45.11 expressvpn because I like to keep my my collectible purchases a secret you've

00:31:49.01 heard me talk about the evil uh spoon and thimble cabal uh I'm in sort of a

00:31:53.23 constant battle of good and evil with them uh right and wrong as it were and I

00:31:59.11 like to use expressvpn to keep my thimble and

00:32:02.11 spoon purchases or not purchases safe secure your online data today by

00:32:06.20 visiting expressvpn.com face that's e-x-p-r-e-s-s-vpn.com

00:32:12.02 face and you can get an extra three months free

00:32:15.21 expressvpn.com face pretty sure I spelled it all correctly

00:32:21.01 this podcast is sponsored by better help online therapy I think the best way to

00:32:26.09 think about therapy is through an analogy we get an oil change for our car

00:32:31.06 to prevent a bigger issue down the road I have had a piston seize up before and

00:32:36.20 it is way more expensive to unfreeze an engine than it is to get the prescribed

00:32:42.11 occasional oil change trust me don't run out of oil in your car don't run out of

00:32:46.23 oil in your brain we see the doctor and we go to the gym to take care of our

00:32:50.15 bodies to prevent injury and disease we do these chores regular some of us do

00:32:54.15 them regularly to avoid a messy house I do personally I don't like mess I don't

00:32:58.21 like clutter in my house in my brain anywhere and going to therapy is kind of

00:33:02.12 like that it's routine maintenance for your mental and emotional wellness

00:33:06.18 and it helps prevent bigger issues down the road and I can personally attest to

00:33:10.21 this as someone who's been in therapy for

00:33:12.19 more than a decade now it also doesn't mean something's wrong with you it just

00:33:16.00 means that you're investing in yourself to keep yourself healthy better help is

00:33:20.13 customized online therapy that offers video phone and even live chat sessions

00:33:25.02 with your therapist so you don't have to see anyone on camera if you don't want

00:33:59.01 do we move on to the ball or do we move on to prototypes

00:34:04.00 oh I'm less excited about well here's what I want to talk about

00:34:09.22 okay if I want prototypes I will be furious with you because I want to talk

00:34:15.18 prototypes I want to talk about the route 44.

00:34:20.21 I want you guys to watch I want Gavin to

00:34:24.17 send you guys the video of the route 40.

00:34:27.08 What is the route 44

00:34:29.07 okay so we went on Sunday we went to a park uh

00:34:33.12 we Emily and Millie and I picked up Gavin we went to a sports store we

00:34:38.22 bought a uh radar an official radar gun by the way guys congratulations face

00:34:44.04 owns a radar gun now we can clock the speed of a lot of [ __ ] I spent real

00:34:47.22 money on it it's [ __ ] nice we're good fantastic uh bought a bun we got we got

00:34:52.06 two baseball gloves now face has we're gonna be able to field a team

00:34:55.20 pretty soon the only thing we're gonna need is players

00:34:58.18 we're gonna have all the equipment right uh anyway so after we could talk about

00:35:02.12 the whether you guys want to talk about throwing the baseball or not it's not

00:35:05.14 important we can do that if we need to but I I sense I'm getting a sense that

00:35:08.21 we probably don't want to however on the way home we thought we would celebrate

00:35:12.17 you know like when you uh when you go to the big baseball fin

00:35:16.19 little league world series or whatever it is in your town and you uh you hit

00:35:22.13 the the you win the game and then everybody goes to like dairy queen

00:35:27.08 blizzards or whatever well we went to uh our tradition on sun days is to go to

00:35:32.06 sonic and get a route 44. A route 44 is a drink at sonic that's a cherry

00:35:36.21 lemonade and it's got real cherries and real or cherry limeade it's got real

00:35:40.23 cherries and real lime in it it's called

00:35:44.02 a route 44 because it's 44 ounces we get the diet and then we just just

00:35:48.06 bathe in it essentially and Gavin had never heard of her diet route 44.

00:35:52.07 So we were like let's get route 44's on the way home to celebrate all the

00:35:55.12 baseball throwing and so we went through and we got it he was uh uh uh well I'll

00:35:59.07 let him speak it out he was over the moon with it but uh but

00:36:03.09 then he got out of the car

00:36:10.00 do you want to explain what happened together

00:36:14.00 oh well uh what happened Geoff uh thanks for asking I was carrying the camera at

00:36:18.21 the tripod quite big so I had to just like have my hand over

00:36:23.15 the top of the lid of the drink but the drink is is a big old American size

00:36:29.16 44 ounces yeah so obviously it slipped uh it the the

00:36:33.12 lid came away I I ended up throwing it basically up the side of my house and in

00:36:38.12 my lawn and a bright

00:36:44.04 but as soon as it happens you can hear if you turn the volume all the way up

00:36:50.03 you can hear a very muffled Geoff losing his [ __ ] laughing and then he

00:36:55.14 proceeds to roll the window down and cackle out into the street

00:37:00.12 I wonder if I should just because we can't post the video but I can I can

00:37:05.04 play the audio yeah play the audio we can't play the video because it shows

00:37:09.11 your house but yeah play the audio nick maybe nick could just cut the audio in

00:37:13.00 about now.

00:37:18.03 [Laughter]

00:37:21.05 It's the most honest laughter I've ever had

00:37:25.22 there was that and then at one point Emily we were driving and I pointed out

00:37:31.03 a crazy lady on the side of the road to Emily and she turned right as we hit a

00:37:35.10 speed bump so she hit it full speed and gavin's head hit the back of the car the

00:37:39.10 roof in the back of the car he said he thought he swallowed his tongue and that

00:37:43.15 was very funny too I I've watched this 20 times at this point this is

00:37:48.10 I don't think I've ever seen Geoff happier to be honest

00:37:52.06 it might have been the best day of Geoff's life

00:37:57.21 oh man it really is the hardest I've laughed in a long long

00:38:04.15 long time oh that was pure pure joy oh my god did Millie see it yeah

00:38:13.05 [ __ ] it doesn't matter what we do gav or where we go

00:38:16.21 if we hang out something that funny happens every time I don't understand it

00:38:21.22 it's it's like a hundred percent reliability at this point yeah

00:38:26.21 you thought we were fine you were on your way to your front door you were

00:38:31.16 like no pickles [Laughter]

00:38:39.12 oh my god it's like I [ __ ] somehow you've captured the

00:38:44.06 essence of dawn zimmer eating [ __ I by dropping a cup like it's the same

00:38:53.18 there's so many layers did the car stop Geoff to laugh at Gavin to like we were

00:39:01.20 still in his driveway oh you're laughing I started laughing then I rolled my

00:39:06.21 window down to point at them and laugh and that's why I think what you're

00:39:11.06 hearing at the end [Laughter]

00:39:20.12 I just like that the crappy security mic inside a car like that's how loud.

00:39:29.09 [Music]

00:39:32.00 It was pretty [ __ ] funny I like to imagine the cucumber lady was

00:39:37.00 walking by like terrible throwing form the worst throwing form at that door

00:39:41.09 I've ever seen just god these guys are weird

00:39:47.11 so have you tried to Kevin will you ever

00:39:50.11 try it is this like what is you've never had it still I'm guessing no I I I'm in

00:39:56.02 the car oh how was it what's your review of a of a diet cherry limeade route 44.

00:40:00.08 I mean I don't I don't typically go for like giant vats of sugary trash but it's

00:40:04.20 pretty good it was actually yeah it's quite nice I didn't have well I mean I

00:40:09.09 obviously didn't finish it my lawn did but it was pretty good

00:40:13.22 Eric said you got a route six or seven.

00:40:22.23 I wasn't uh I wasn't gonna bring this up but I all you're not the only one who

00:40:28.14 spilled a beverage in the last few days I uh I heard about it I got some burger

00:40:34.08 king delivered uh and I was walking up the stairs and

00:40:37.07 you know like when you're planning ahead I'm like okay I'm gonna plate this here

00:40:41.05 I'm gonna have this all nice I'm gonna set it up all great tripped over the

00:40:46.12 last stair going up the stairs fell sodas flew out of my hands I had like

00:40:52.15 two two big drinks slid across the floor

00:40:55.16 one of them ended up perfectly face down

00:40:57.18 like the lid was down on the floor and I was like that's the worst [ __ ] angle

00:41:01.12 that that could have landed so I like panicked quickly grabbed it it spilled

00:41:07.07 all over the [ __ ] wall it's in bedroom it's like your [ __ ] smoothie

00:41:10.20 Geoff it covered so many walls I get to the kitchen I put them all down I

00:41:15.03 realized that the [ __ ] lids are taped I forgot burger king an issue I had in

00:41:20.02 the past they taped the [ __ ] things down it was totally fine the way it was

00:41:24.04 that it was my violent rip up upwards is what [ __ ] everything up and launched

00:41:29.07 it if I was just delicate wouldn't have been a problem

00:41:32.01 coated my walls I'm still cleaning that was on like Friday I'm still cleaning

00:41:36.16 soda stain from my wall like oh [ __ ]

00:41:38.23 it's wrong it's still there terrible man that is funny so I don't I don't

00:41:43.05 like do we um I don't know if we necessarily want to get into it I want

00:41:46.18 to know which throw is less impressive gavin's drink thrower Geoff with a

00:41:50.18 baseball I really don't know oh you know what else we should get into real fast

00:41:55.05 on the way to that because this came up on the drive over there okay no

00:42:00.04 uh I think it's pretty clear I I don't wanna I'm not trying to to belabor a

00:42:03.17 point but everybody knows that I'm uh recently a pastrami guy I actually had a

00:42:08.15 pastrami sandwich for lunch today it was phenomenal about an hour ago uh and and

00:42:14.12 as we know I'm I'm becoming a koozie guy as well I'm actually going hard in

00:42:18.00 jacuzzis and yeah I've decided the 2020

00:42:20.12 22 is going to be like a real bit it's going to be real heavy pastrami and

00:42:24.06 koozie uh the forecast calls for heavy pastrami

00:42:27.16 and koozies yeah uh for 2022 for sure I've also been thinking about flirting

00:42:32.17 with uh being an arm out the window when I drive kind of guy although we've had

00:42:36.19 some some mixed results over the last week or so with other obnoxious people

00:42:41.03 with their windows down while we were discussing this Gavin has

00:42:44.09 decided and I wanted to bring this up so

00:42:46.12 it doesn't get lost because I think it's a great idea Gavin wants to move into

00:42:50.08 the area of being a cereal on the front porch guy eating cereal on the front

00:42:55.06 porch yeah I saw wait I was in the car with Geoff and I just saw a guy out on

00:42:58.15 his front porch sat in a nice little chair just eating cereal and I just

00:43:02.05 thought that just looks really nice that just like that looks like a really nice

00:43:06.23 place to eat cereal maybe maybe I should try that front porch more than a back

00:43:11.01 porch I think so I think like

00:43:15.09 yeah is it the world in front like I don't

00:43:18.10 I don't know I mean that guy saw us we were on our way to go through baseball

00:43:22.19 yeah that was the highlight of his cereal eat yeah he had a front row seat

00:43:28.12 the best part of that day was uh you taking us to every baseball field in

00:43:33.05 Austin and uh we get there and they're all in use so we end up doing it next to

00:43:38.04 a baseball field just on some grass we could have done it anyway as far as

00:43:42.05 regulation uh as far as regulation baseball diamonds go this was not a

00:43:46.23 regular it was pretty face regulation for sure uh

00:43:49.20 yeah I mean I don't really know what you

00:43:51.22 guys I don't know that there's much of a story there

00:43:54.10 we we all piled into the car I told you the funny part about hitting the speed

00:43:58.19 bump I told you the thing about the cereal well did we all give our guesses uh

00:44:03.08 I reinforced the pistol yeah then we went we threw the ball and then

00:44:07.14 Gavin spilled the drink I really feel like we got we covered most of it I

00:44:11.22 I I feel like what was your prediction I'm sure I

00:44:15.14 remember if I made an official prediction before I would guess that Geoff throws

00:44:21.20 57. I'm going to say we learned a lot about a lot of things oh interest my

00:44:27.12 guess Andrew was 585857

00:44:29.12 wow really your price is right Eric what was yours

00:44:31.20 Eric and nick you know I didn't think you were breaking like for your first

00:44:35.16 throw for like the first time out there I didn't think you were breaking like

00:44:39.16 62.62.

00:44:41.05 Nick says around 60.

00:44:43.17 So I feel like you guys have I feel like

00:44:44.17 you guys have inflated all these numbers over time these feel a little higher

00:44:48.19 than the last time I remember them but okay

00:44:50.15 I'm just I'm curiou did he uh did Geoff throw one ball how many balls did Geoff

00:44:54.22 throw for this I would say eight or nine we had two balls eight or nine okay and

00:45:00.21 do you remember which ball was the fastest and we

00:45:09.11 and what was what was that attempt on was that like two and a half second and

00:45:14.10 last attempt I think okay that would be a video I would say I probably

00:45:19.20 probably threw it at least 12 times through it at least 12 times a second.

00:45:25.16 I would be confident if I were you the fact that shows you got a little stamina

00:45:30.17 second throw and last throw I gotta say uh assuming I didn't hit like assuming

00:45:35.22 this continues right like obviously if I threw the ball at 80

00:45:38.16 miles an hour we're done boring segment it's over I did what I said I was gonna

00:45:42.18 do a bit of a letdown if I'm being honest with you because we thought that

00:45:45.23 it would be fun to watch me build my way up uh so if I through with the 80 then

00:45:50.08 that sucks we're done but if I didn't then we get to watch the the three-month

00:45:54.00 journey of me building it up and I'm happy to report that if that's the case

00:45:57.12 my arm feels fine I didn't have any ill effects at all now

00:46:00.17 I don't know what this number is I I read I don't remember I apologize not

00:46:05.03 giving proper credit to the person I saw somebody suggest

00:46:07.20 that we do a nugget first speed off that I have to eat more nuggets than

00:46:12.12 whatever your pitch count we don't I'm not sure what the number is

00:46:15.17 for that what did Geoff throw do we talk about it now do we is this a reveal what

00:46:21.20 did you throw well do do we do we wanna we'll say Milly we'll see everybody

00:46:27.05 through emily's fastest was 16

00:46:30.04 I think 16 miles an hour uh Millie was able to throw it 26 miles an

00:46:35.03 hour Gavin through he got a recorded time third a few times do you feel

00:46:39.07 comfortable telling selling telling well I should say that I was very nervous

00:46:42.19 about throwing the ball because the last time I threw a baseball I hit Millie in

00:46:46.00 the face straight in her face do you want to send them the photo of

00:46:49.16 what happened when you threw the ball this time okay let me uh let me put this

00:46:53.19 in the display wait so send that [ __ ]

00:46:56.01 photo uh yeah I'll tell you what's happened is kevin's magnetically

00:46:59.13 attracted to being an [ __ ] to my daughter no is accuracy a consideration

00:47:03.19 at all or was it just pure no accuracy didn't matter

00:47:07.08 and that actually made it a little difficult because it was nothing to throw to

00:47:12.00 so if you zoom in you can see so gavin's supposed to be all right in

00:47:16.03 this photo you see Emily my girlfriend taking a photo you see Millie hauling

00:47:21.05 ass because there's a ball going straight for her head

00:47:24.09 to the left on the extreme left you'll see a tripod with a camera on it Gavin

00:47:29.06 is supposed to be throwing left of that I would better be winging that camera

00:47:34.15 it went straight towards millie's head she had

00:47:38.01 to run out of the way immediately and uh that is her running in abject fear

00:47:43.09 thank god for her teenage reflexes I was not I wasn't even facing her I

00:47:51.14 couldn't believe it um she was I think she was not happy and I think slightly

00:47:56.23 more worried afterwards but uh I hate I hate because of that sort of uh slip

00:48:02.10 release um I I failed to throw it very fast my my number was uh 43 I would

00:48:07.18 argue that turns out 43 is pretty fast I mean not

00:48:11.14 so fast Milly couldn't dodge it thank Christ

00:48:15.05 uh but 43 is a fast ball I gotta say I gotta say it's pretty fast yeah Eric can

00:48:20.17 back that up 43. It's uh it's that's it's more heat it's more heat than I had

00:48:26.06 anticipated Eric said yeah it is about half as fast as 80.

00:48:30.02 Yeah he's right that's technically correct yeah so Geoff what was your

00:48:33.15 number well I'll tell you what what did you throw it at 43. All right well I'll

00:48:39.12 say this uh I I beat 43. That's true better than that at 46

00:48:44.02 uh coming off of a myriad of a lifetime of injuries

00:48:48.17 and and no preparation I managed to still throw it faster than a 30 what

00:48:54.07 three year old uh British man so I feel pretty good about that uh

00:48:59.01 that's a good hey I'm gonna be honest with you I didn't

00:49:02.16 hit 80. Yeah I I thought I would I knew I thought I had like a 5050 shot

00:49:07.12 didn't quite get there fell a little short but I see room for improvement and

00:49:12.11 uh I I haven't started yet obviously because we hadn't had this conversation

00:49:16.15 so I'll begin the training now I guess we'll say 90 days from November 2nd you

00:49:22.10 know we'll try again uh and what I was even thinking is uh

00:49:25.13 would be fun kind of like how they did on top gear we could have like a

00:49:28.12 leader board we could have friends of face throw the ball and see how fast

00:49:31.17 they can do we can see you can have the best time in like the face family I

00:49:35.20 think it'd be a lot of fun we'll get you in there

00:49:37.21 uh Andrew we'll get we get nick we'll get Eric uh it'll be a grand old time

00:49:42.08 we'll have a little leader board it'll be great so are we still aiming for you to

00:49:46.11 get 80 is that still the goal I'd like to get I'd like to get there

00:49:49.15 I'd like to get that I got a little bit of I got a little bit of room uh I got a

00:49:53.16 little bit of room to improve but I I think I think you could hit 60

00:49:58.10 with some training I would I would like to agree with you I'm a little I'm a

00:50:03.12 little off of 60. Uh my my top speed which I hit twice so there was some

00:50:08.06 consistency there uh was 49

00:50:10.20 miles so [ __ ] you're so high

00:50:15.12 turns out 49 is really fast and really hard that was the I think.

00:50:23.22 I got I ran over to the radar gun that Emily was holding

00:50:27.20 and before she even caught out I just burst out laughing because it said

00:50:32.12 it said 42 on it and Geoff was just like all right well you

00:50:37.14 know I'm gonna throw it again it's just like not demoralizing

00:50:41.20 but never breached 50

00:50:44.04 all day so tried so hard tried so hard I couldn't do it definitely gonna break

00:50:49.05 50.

00:50:51.05 I'd like to break was there a feeling of like 60 was in the air before Geoff

00:50:55.04 through was their anticipation what was that moment like before uh there was a

00:50:59.12 moment there was a moment when Emily was we

00:51:02.12 were testing out the gun and she was like just throw it that way a little bit

00:51:05.18 and we just like tossed it back and forth and she clocked that at like 30

00:51:09.16 miles an hour and we were like oh that was nothing we weren't even throwing it

00:51:12.20 hard easy so we were all like well we're gonna

00:51:15.04 throw this thing like 70 miles an hour if we throw it hard and then it turns

00:51:18.07 out the difference between 30 the effort to require to throw 30 and uh 49 it's

00:51:23.01 tremendous uh and it's yeah so uh anyway definitely going to hit 50.

00:51:28.04 I think I can probably hit 60.80 we're going to shoot for

00:51:31.15 not positive I'm going to get there 90

00:51:34.00 days it might take a little bit longer but that's what we determined so that's

00:51:37.16 what we're going to go for although I imagine if I don't hit 80 I'll probably

00:51:41.09 just be just continuing the journey you won't hit 60 if given a year

00:51:45.23 I was gonna say let's get to the 90 days first wait you said hey okay hang on

00:51:52.04 you say you can hit 80 if given a little bit longer how much how

00:51:56.15 what do you need to like play triple a ball like what do you well we're gonna

00:52:01.16 see we're gonna see uh we got 90 days we'll

00:52:05.04 see a how good is my training regimen right like does it work did I pick the

00:52:09.03 right one have I invested in the right people hopefully the answer is yes

00:52:12.17 hopefully I make progress another big thing you got to worry about in my age

00:52:15.16 am I going to suffer any training setbacks due to injuries a lot of people

00:52:19.15 get hurt in the weight room doing doing workouts doing training and so I got to

00:52:23.01 watch that so it's you know it's a delicate balance assuming all conditions

00:52:27.02 is going to hit the weight assuming all assuming all conditions are met I'm

00:52:30.13 going to have to I'm going to train five days a week to throw this ball 80 miles

00:52:34.23 an hour uh I mean ah duh I don't obviously I feel like 80's dead I would bet

00:52:42.12 anything you can't throw higher than my nugget number I bet anything that you

00:52:47.07 can't throw a 68. I don't I think we should go with the nuggets and I don't

00:52:51.10 think I think you'll out-nugget the ball

00:52:53.12 I think I can be no absolutely I think I can hit 80. I don't know that I will in

00:52:57.01 90 days but I think given enough time I can however there's a zero Geoffy you

00:53:01.06 realize the more time that passes the harder it gets for you you're not

00:53:04.17 getting younger like I'm just training dude age is a state of mind I don't

00:53:08.15 think age of state of mind I'm already faster than Gavin yeah but to be honest

00:53:11.23 I don't even think I can move my arm 80

00:53:13.23 miles an hour like empty I would love to know what speed that that drink was

00:53:17.22 flying on your hand at that looked like a solid 20.

00:53:23.16 That's what we should I even started standing in the way so I was like Geoff

00:53:28.08 maybe if you aim at me it'll go faster didn't really help here's what's gonna

00:53:32.05 happen uh we're gonna check back in on January 31st and I'll throw the ball

00:53:36.20 again and we'll see if I show any kind of improvement or not one or two things

00:53:40.11 is gonna happen I'm gonna take this very seriously and I'm going to train hard I

00:53:44.05 have a trunk full of gear that leads me to believe that things are headed that

00:53:48.19 way however I also have 46 years of uh intimate knowledge of myself and so I

00:53:53.06 think there's a really good chance I forget about it tomorrow and I don't

00:53:56.21 think about it again until we talk about it on January 31st so one of those two

00:54:00.10 things is going to happen I'm not sure which but it's either I'm either going

00:54:04.00 to go slower or way faster next time you were just talking about having a

00:54:08.07 leader board surely you'd be reminded if well we can already make this we can

00:54:11.18 already make the leader yes sir people just gotta throw the ball all

00:54:14.16 right so that I'm saying I gotta say that was bull so now we got prototypes

00:54:18.13 then chocolate is that right we do I feel like I think we should have to

00:54:21.22 close yeah we'll have to end on chocolate and what not

00:54:37.01 that no when it hits your available isn't it okay can I prep the chocolate for

00:54:43.22 for that by prepping you mean snapping it and putting it in your mouth then

00:54:48.12 yeah okay so I can prep I'm gonna start prepping the chocolate then while you're

00:54:52.04 doing that uh I think we should push prototypes because I still got photos to

00:54:55.21 edit and stuff oh um although I could get it together if we needed to but if

00:54:59.04 you want to do pro to like what's wrong Andrew it's just this is this there's a

00:55:03.03 lot more chocolate than that yeah I think I think I think we've got a

00:55:07.03 solid episode here we'll cover prototypes in two days when we talk again uh

00:55:11.17 but I have a question for you guys so a lot there's a merch related question not

00:55:15.02 to circle back to merch but I I wanna I wanna check the temperature on something

00:55:19.05 uh a lot of people have requested and suggested that we make baseball jerseys

00:55:24.08 I have resisted that because I would never it just seems hokey to me a little

00:55:28.16 bit um and as as it's correctly pointed out over and over again we are not a

00:55:32.15 baseball podcast we are a fruit uh podcast if or anything these days so you

00:55:37.12 know however uh what if we made is there do you guys want to make a

00:55:42.19 baseball jersey and if you did what would you think about this idea because

00:55:46.05 I think the thing that people like about face merch is that it's unique and it's

00:55:51.16 uh well it's been it's it's been dipped in my misery a lot of the time and I

00:55:55.09 think that's a selling point too but uh exclusivity is also helpful what if we

00:55:58.20 made like you know how like when you're on a

00:56:01.09 little league team you get your your jersey with your number and your name on

00:56:04.23 the back of it and you get to pick your number right and then

00:56:09.12 uh so what if you don't get to pick your name but what if we just made 99 number

00:56:13.09 zero zero to 99 jerseys and that's all that there are and depending on which

00:56:17.15 size you order is which number you get and that's just what it is and there's

00:56:21.04 only 99 and so every jersey is a one-of-a-kind yeah that's fine I like it

00:56:25.13 maybe the uh is that I wonder if that's feasible I wonder if we could do that

00:56:29.11 maybe the sponsor of the jersey should be NASA

00:56:31.15 Nassau now oh nasso oh yeah we don't wanna we don't wanna

00:56:35.12 maybe get the smashing sportsman on there somewhere

00:56:38.21 if that's possible we gotta get the audience uh supporting the smashing

00:56:43.13 sportsman yeah oh yeah we're gonna have a good point uniform should definitely

00:56:46.19 be able to acquire him it should definitely be a sponsor uniform's gonna

00:56:51.12 be in there thank me later maybe we got a lot of ads thank me later later

00:56:55.11 too spicy icy we got the beef bracelet we got there's a lot of yeah dude this

00:56:59.05 is a this is gonna look like a Nascar [Laughter]

00:57:06.10 I um how do I wanna approach this is really orally

00:57:11.14 okay so we're officially pushing prototypes to next episode and we'll

00:57:16.05 just end on I mean we're not we're like an hour in and yeah we're 50 okay I'm

00:57:21.16 gonna start at 55 minutes of my recording which isn't why I can start

00:57:26.08 the timer for you I was just visually okay okay three two one go go go oh no.

00:57:35.18 I have water oh he just goes not

00:57:46.17 how much did you put in how's your first bite how many squares [Laughter]

00:57:54.06 so he put half of a bar of a hundred this is 100 chocolate

00:57:59.07 100 cocoa content chocolate let me ask you a question I was thinking about this

00:58:04.10 the other day while he's suffering if like if a

00:58:07.06 chocolate bar is a hundred percent like he's eating pure chocolate right now

00:58:10.20 right what is it what if it's if he's eating the 70 what's the other 30

00:58:15.03 percent no this is fine what do you mean it's fine I'm fine [Music]

00:58:22.21 is it really not effective I had I had like one line

00:58:26.10 of squares and it was one of the worst things I ever ate I'm miserable right

00:58:31.05 now but this is totally doable wow your handling is so I'm so surprised

00:58:49.01 no sugar apparently that 30 percent of other ingredients is the part that makes

00:58:53.20 people like chocolate yeah it turns out all the stuff that's not cocoa beans

00:58:57.13 it's uh yeah it's the good stuff turns out that when you're

00:59:00.09 yeah when you're eating a chocolate bar you're really eating the stuff that

00:59:03.17 binds the chocolate uh is it is it are you slowing down what'd you say

00:59:10.10 well did you say they were lord fauntleroy I'm working

00:59:16.06 all right you're halfway through uh oh no you got five minutes you're at two

00:59:20.08 you've got the time right you've got two minutes you're at two minutes ten

00:59:23.16 mm-hmm can I drink with this or no could you

00:59:26.17 what can I drink am I allowed to have a drink or not yeah at the end but not

00:59:32.06 during I don't think so man nick says no [ __ ] you nick wow lovingly

00:59:37.20 uh what percentage through the bar do you think you are right now um it's hard

00:59:43.07 to answer because there's so much paste in your mouth it's just

00:59:51.09 how much of the bar has not entered into your mouth yet three minutes

00:59:58.21 seven eight like eleven squares maybe why not how many squares did you start

01:00:06.00 with a lot like over half the bar I got like maybe

01:00:09.22 a quarter of the bar left I don't think you have time to be chat about it I

01:00:13.04 think you should be chewing well then stop [ __ ] asking me questions

01:00:17.11 he's got a point you have to get arrested

01:00:26.10 well let me ask you a question Gavin do you think he's gonna you think he's

01:00:31.01 gonna make it it sounds like he might he's got a a minute 20 left oh I don't

01:00:35.22 know what it proved it sounds super gross and it sounds like

01:00:39.07 it's exactly as gross as you said it was well immediately it's not it's not

01:00:42.17 flawed him like it did me it didn't it's not like ruined his day well I think I

01:00:46.01 think what the thing that we're gonna learn here is that Andrew swims in gross

01:00:51.12 in in ways that other people aren't comfortable maybe

01:00:55.11 at this point Andrew is it all in your mouth uh-huh

01:00:59.23 so there's nothing left in the container wow I'm so impressed I'm so impressed

01:01:05.22 I've got enough time what do you say about time he wants to know how much

01:01:10.21 time he's got he's left wrong he's not going to make it

01:01:16.08 he's not going to be he's going to swallow it he can't do it you got it.

01:01:27.09 [Laughter]

01:01:34.17 He's drowning

01:01:39.22 and time five minutes more time

01:01:47.09 more time all right well can you do it within seven oh definitely

01:01:55.14 it just sounds like you're storing it in your face but you're not working to get

01:02:01.00 it down but Brian I could listen to this all day

01:02:13.16 it can't be that bad I'm excited for this review after he's done

01:02:20.21 what's the issue with uh like phys like what's what's holding you up swallowing

01:02:25.15 it [Laughter]

01:02:29.12 I feel like if we give you to seven minutes that counts because we asked you

01:02:34.10 probably two minutes worth of questions we're going you know how in the do you

01:02:39.09 know how like in do you like it you know like NASA

01:02:42.07 merchandise it has like the logo it'll have like a little astronaut and then

01:02:46.02 it'll have the sky and they'll have stars like yeah like

01:02:49.17 should if when we make the Nassau logo should it look like that but it's little

01:02:53.11 nuggets it's like a little I-shaped nuggets yeah I think that's great

01:02:57.20 exactly yeah he's gonna need this 20 seconds till seven minutes

01:03:02.14 boy is Andrew the chocolate how has he got more in his mouth now

01:03:07.11 than when he started

01:03:27.18 don't thank him

01:03:40.17 he's deteriorating

01:03:45.22 it sounds like it's getting wetter maybe maybe there's a lot maybe oh no no

01:03:53.01 you can't do that wow

01:04:08.23 he's gonna come up with 10 minutes with chocolate as well.

01:04:16.00 I would love to see somebody trying to subtitle that

01:04:21.07 oh god it's all over he sound like a head crab on you

01:04:31.16 it's like it's getting thicker in my mouth

01:04:42.13 almost uh almost nine minutes since you started I'm making progress

01:04:47.11 oh wow that sounded pretty clear actually yeah how close are you to

01:04:52.12 finishing would you say uh pretty close so you're setting a world record right

01:04:56.16 now um so when you say it done that'll be the official world record just like

01:05:02.04 the current fastest uh face baseball throw in the world is 49 miles an hour

01:05:06.10 I have the world record at the moment you will have the world record on this

01:05:10.12 I'm so close we should have like a guinness book of records but it's just

01:05:15.16 face records done did it nine and a half minutes

01:05:18.03 930 on the dot yep I think I could hit seven easily I learned a few things in

01:05:22.01 the middle of that what did you what did you learn the only way to

01:05:26.12 ingest it is to treat it like I'm swallowing pills like it's medication

01:05:31.20 that became my approach you're just swallowing full lumps yeah

01:05:35.09 well no like it was I chewed it to the point where it was just like a thick

01:05:39.08 paste it's a chocolatey liquid and that's what it was like mud it was like

01:05:44.03 trying to eat mud and you just have to swal like you will never chew it to

01:05:49.09 a texture that is great did it taste good it tastes awful

01:05:53.09 but it's consistently bad oh it's consistently what

01:05:58.12 bad like once you it's there's it doesn't climb the real problem would

01:06:02.23 have been if you would have made me laugh really hard I would have shot

01:06:07.03 chocolate [ __ ] everywhere and there's no coming back from that

01:06:10.12 yeah you need a new room I would so has it gone up or down then your confidence

01:06:14.21 after that I think I'm a dark chocolate guy

01:06:18.01 we'll have to update the kitchen magnets

01:06:20.07 okay I uh I gotta be honest I don't want to get involved in this

01:06:24.07 in this chocolate game you guys have going on I got I'm gonna put my eyeballs

01:06:27.12 in baseball throws but I feel like I could eat it faster

01:06:30.12 than that I feel like it wouldn't be as hard as yours I'd love to see you try it

01:06:34.00 yeah I think next week to be honest next on Thursday I think you could beat him

01:06:35.22 Geoff I don't trust you saying that but I

01:06:38.00 do think we have a chocolate off I'll do it I don't I don't I think I could do

01:06:41.12 better I don't I definitely don't trust gavin's

01:06:45.02 uh uh motivations uh and I think he's a at least when it comes to me usually a

01:06:49.11 liar so uh but I do honestly personally think I could do better than that

01:06:54.16 I think we should have a chocolate off on Thursday I'm all for this you know

01:06:58.08 what's better than a chocolate off what a chocolate trio we should gather

01:07:02.12 another one and we should all I'd do a three-way oh no there's no way I

01:07:06.12 I need to I'm still working I don't want to ruin my I'm still working up my

01:07:10.19 palette we'll see if we can eat an entire chocolate bar before Gavin gets

01:07:14.01 through one square

01:07:17.20 nick's got a great point low calorie too

01:07:20.21 tight in antioxidants maybe I don't know I did start on uh I started on 70

01:07:25.16 by the way you did honestly I had a piece of seventy

01:07:29.13 percent two and it gave me more chocolate confidence I'm like 30 more of

01:07:34.12 this can't be bad yeah 70 is great I I wonder which percentage it gets uh

01:07:39.14 tremendously awful see I don't like any of it so it's

01:07:42.22 equally bad I think is my advantage then how are you gonna be a dark chocolate

01:07:46.18 guy uh it's like before I'd never even touch it I feel like I just had the most

01:07:51.11 potent dark chocolate you could have and I was okay with it

01:07:54.02 I know what you mean like I at very early on I tasted alcohol and I was like

01:07:58.10 this is [ __ ] disgusting but I definitely can tell I'm gonna be an

01:08:02.21 alcohol guy and then I was so maybe it's like that

01:08:05.04 yeah could be yeah all right that was great I feel like uh hopefully the uh

01:08:09.12 comet levers will be satisfied I feel like we uh we closed a lot of loose ends

01:08:13.07 today uh I I Gavin and I threw a baseball it

01:08:17.01 was pretty uh pretty badass uh everybody was pretty impressed with the results

01:08:21.20 Andrew you were a demon on that chocolate that was fantastic to watch uh

01:08:26.10 oh we had the whole nugget saga who who could forget that what a what a ride

01:08:31.07 that was and uh and the real fun was doing it together

01:08:34.02 uh knowing that the audience was was right there alongside us so we really

01:08:38.06 appreciate that and uh maybe tune in next week and we'll do it again and if

01:08:41.22 you don't uh hopefully nothing bad happened to you in your personal life uh

01:08:45.10 that kept you away from the podcast hopefully you were just forgetful or

01:08:48.15 lazy or whatever but maybe get your [ __ ]

01:08:50.20 together next time have some loyalty all right peace out [Music]
