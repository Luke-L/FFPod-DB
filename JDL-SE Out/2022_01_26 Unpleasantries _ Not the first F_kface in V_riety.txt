00:00:23.08 [Music]

00:00:31.18 I had a realization earlier today it has only been confirmed further by today

00:00:37.11 okay I had I was thinking about it it's laying down I woke up this morning I

00:00:40.21 thought you know what this is a weird thing to wake up to can I ask you a

00:00:43.21 question yeah you said you were thinking about that you were laying down are you

00:00:47.15 still in bed at this point or have you started your day and then gone back to

00:00:51.05 bed no no it was when I woke up it was when I when I first woke up okay through

00:00:56.12 the through the slats of this through no I fixed the bed okay

00:00:59.23 I have actually a thing related to that to talk about today but fix the bed

00:01:04.23 waking up thinking about recording very excited and then I thought about Gavin

00:01:08.17 and and that you always show up on time I think Gavin hates pleasantries yeah I

00:01:13.18 think there's there's nobody that hates pleasantries more than Gavin and I don't

00:01:18.14 think you realize how much joy you're missing in your life by opting out of

00:01:23.22 pleasantries in what it seems to be every scenario name a memorable

00:01:28.17 pleasantry experience I literally just today talked I spent 15 minutes talking

00:01:33.01 with nick maybe not 15 like five talking with nick about things I never knew

00:01:36.15 about him that was super interesting about pleasantries that's the

00:01:40.05 conversation no it's what's the truth that's pleasant hey how's it going there

00:01:44.20 you go no Gavin pleasantries is before we record me being able to say to you

00:01:49.05 how's your day going and just having a little bit of a talk instead of you

00:01:52.04 showing up and immediately recording there's no I would say that the

00:01:56.15 pleasantries led in to a genuine conversation

00:01:58.23 which is what's great about pleasantries you don't you're talking about a thing

00:02:02.06 you don't know pleasantry it's true about that uh pleasantries can lead into

00:02:06.11 a world of entertainment including an inspiring conversation that's the beauty

00:02:10.14 of the pleasantry I also experienced a wonderful conversation of pleasantries

00:02:15.03 this morning uh talking to Geoff yetter and Alan and a bunch of people from work

00:02:19.03 while I was waiting for an executive meeting to start

00:02:23.18 I'm laser focused with Andrew on this one I think you need to

00:02:26.19 adopt like I don't know if you had a bad

00:02:29.16 pleasantry experience I don't know where this started for you I don't know

00:02:34.08 you had unpleasant trees okay I know I've known both of you for

00:02:38.22 many years and we've had many many pleasantries

00:02:42.06 no no we haven't I haven't had a single pleasantry with you on this show [ __ ]

00:02:49.04 not a single one

00:02:52.10 no that is insane for you to think that halo is pleasantries is it no that's

00:02:57.12 ridiculous that's just a social outing pleasantries is the thing before you do

00:03:03.01 the thing it was that's before we play the game I think andrew's right god I

00:03:08.07 hate to pile on Gavin but I gotta think andrew's right I would go even further

00:03:12.21 and I would say that I in my experience because I I I recently I think last

00:03:17.03 weekend I caught a game a couple games of halo with you guys and my friend

00:03:22.15 Trevor and I quickly was reminded that I'm incapable of having any level of

00:03:26.17 conversation with either of you without it turning into a podcast or content

00:03:32.04 really yeah that's odd within two minutes I was in

00:03:35.20 podcast mode so I don't think pleasantries are possible because uh the

00:03:40.12 second our mouths open in my estimation it turns into content well okay I might

00:03:44.12 be maybe I just don't know where the line is drawn at palestry so

00:03:48.17 for example Andrew why don't you have some pleasantries with me right now

00:03:52.22 I can't have pleasantries you can't have pleasantries while we're pleasantries

00:03:56.16 are not for recording pleasantries are like a little hey how's it going how's

00:04:00.11 your day it's a warm-up imagine we weren't recording imagine we were

00:04:05.16 recording okay you can't force pleasantries all right I think

00:04:10.04 I think that's a little extreme Andrew I think you can play pretend no

00:04:15.03 no because you're the king yes and Andrew yes and I disagree

00:04:20.04 strongly because if we do pleasantry thing we're gonna fall right into his

00:04:24.03 hand Geoff and it's gonna be boring as [ __ ] and it's not gonna work at all and

00:04:27.22 we're gonna just feel anxious that we're eating up showtime [ __ ] pleasure

00:04:35.03 with episode 87 of face I'm Gavin that's Geoff and you're

00:04:39.14 untrue Andrew that's very high energy skip the pleasantries next week

00:04:46.08 next week 10 minutes show up 10 minutes early try the plus just try it

00:04:50.19 deliberately stay after we record every week Geoff has to piss off the second we

00:04:56.10 stop I stay for end pleasantries every week but

00:04:59.19 nobody needs the unpleasant trees oh you

00:05:01.18 don't want my pleasantries at the end no they're great I don't have to leave I

00:05:05.07 leave to get away from having pleasantries at the end I thought you

00:05:08.11 have to like frequently get Millie from stuff yeah a lot of times I do a lot of

00:05:12.09 times I'm racing to get Milly but a lot of but other times I just am done

00:05:17.14 talking to you guys that's fair I I understand that completely yeah this

00:05:22.10 is completely gonna be around me for more than an hour no I I had to live

00:05:27.03 with you off and on for a decade I've had a lot of you oh I wasn't so bad

00:05:31.11 surely he threw a stick at you I'm saying you're pretty bad delivered based

00:05:35.19 off of that dude it was one of the it was one of the great joys of my life was

00:05:41.20 every opportunity and I say that without hyperbole or full of hyperbole

00:05:46.19 a full stix worth of hyperbole Geoff you once told me I was you you just out of

00:05:52.07 nowhere said you're very easy to live with and I

00:05:55.20 thought you were taking the piss I thought you were going to be like

00:05:59.03 here's a list of annoying [ __ ] that I do

00:06:00.22 but it was like a genuine comment I was like damn wow thanks

00:06:04.15 I'm going to tell you something right now yeah I do I'm going to tell you

00:06:08.15 something about you right now and you are easy

00:06:12.06 to everything with in my experience and I mean that is a tremendous compliment

00:06:16.20 you are easy to travel with you are easy to live with you are easy to to commute

00:06:21.03 with you're easy to play video games with you're easy to be have a lifelong

00:06:25.14 friendship with you're easy to do all of the one area you are not easy to blank

00:06:29.13 with is schedule you are impossible this is what I tell people all the time

00:06:35.18 everyone's like oh you know your reputation and I'm telling you if I

00:06:40.04 had one job I would be I think I would genuinely be a nice

00:06:43.12 person to interact with

00:06:46.06 but unfortunately I've got a lot going on all the time yes I don't I don't mean

00:06:51.06 it in that like you're a piece of [ __ ]

00:06:53.16 and you're hard to nail down I mean that you're a busy lad and you've got you've

00:06:57.00 got a million fingers and a million pies

00:06:59.01 and you're constantly in motion and it's just hard to it's just hard to nail you

00:07:03.11 down a lot I'll take that that's a nice compliment

00:07:06.08 yeah I would say that was very pleasant um that was quite that was quite a lot

00:07:11.12 of pleasantries that just occurred no conversation

00:07:14.20 yeah show up 10 minutes early you'll get it

00:07:18.08 it's like a secret door you gotta like run through the thing and Hogwarts

00:07:22.21 the last time you frickin made it the last time I showed up 10 minutes early

00:07:26.14 you shout on me for being early for 10

00:07:28.17 minutes that's true that's my fault and I've

00:07:32.12 only further decreased your interest in pleasantries I'll learn that I apologize

00:07:37.02 but I didn't have the perspective I have

00:07:38.20 now I realize you don't get it you don't there's a whole world of pleasantries

00:07:42.03 you're missing you would have loved to hear the things I heard of the

00:07:45.07 pleasantries before this show what what do you miss

00:07:48.05 well it's not mine to share it's not my information so I'm not gonna say it but

00:07:52.02 it was it was a great conversation you missed out on it but you did mention

00:07:55.14 Geoff that we played halo recently all of us yeah and you're like you immediately

00:07:59.15 went into podcast mode and I was like really that's that's interesting and

00:08:03.07 then and I realized I have a block of content for the show based off from that

00:08:06.15 halo session yeah I I learned yeah because we were it was content I learned

00:08:10.14 something that I I didn't realize that Kevin seems very sensitive about there

00:08:16.08 is there's an accusation uh some some may even say a mystery of

00:08:20.21 sorts it's not an accusation or a mystery when Gavin provides the proof of

00:08:26.03 his own one of you would like to get why don't

00:08:28.16 you explain because I feel like you're you're the center of this

00:08:33.09 explain the uh 13 years of [ __ ] I've been listening to yes

00:08:37.07 please uh back back in the day halo 3 came out it had 1000 game of

00:08:42.02 score as many games did and it was sort of uh among the

00:08:46.08 sort of pre-achievement hunter but among the same people we were very excited to

00:08:51.11 be the first person to complete the entire game's achievements but it was

00:08:56.10 very easy in matchmaking to fake some of the multiplayer achievements you just

00:08:59.20 had to convince the lobby to like hey two people stand together and I'll laser

00:09:03.16 through you because if you get two kills with a laser that's an achievement but

00:09:07.12 we were I feel like we were all going for purity it was sort of me it was Geoff

00:09:12.06 it's Bernie at the time and I feel like we were dead set on getting them legit

00:09:17.22 wouldn't you agree Geoff yeah a hundred percent and uh uh

00:09:21.19 that's what makes this so painful yeah the the final two achievements I was

00:09:25.14 after stepping razor triple kill with the sword in matchmaking pretty

00:09:29.22 difficult at the time I felt like and an overkill which um in

00:09:34.22 free-for-all at the time meant killing everyone else in the game because the

00:09:38.18 free-for-all matches were five people you had to kill everyone within what

00:09:42.19 like three or four seconds of each other I got them all perfectly legitimately

00:09:47.11 very proud of it you can tell from the timestamps of the achievements they're

00:09:51.03 quite far apart and uh to this very day neither Bernie

00:09:55.04 nor Geoff believe me that my overkill was

00:09:57.21 legitimate so first off let me uh let me hop in here and say that uh

00:10:03.00 this was not and Gavin is not uh overselling how difficult this

00:10:06.15 achievement was to get uh there have been very few times I've played video

00:10:11.05 games where I was angry enough to physically smash a controller to the

00:10:14.11 point it doesn't work anymore I lost two controllers in the service of this

00:10:19.10 achievement it took me about 45 days after Gavin got his I remember because I

00:10:24.21 got madder and madder the further away we got because especially after I

00:10:28.15 realized that he had cheated and uh and I was still trying to get my

00:10:32.09 legitimately and then and then that [ __ ] bungie on top of that did an

00:10:37.03 extra [ __ ] you to me uh I I eventually about 45 days later I

00:10:40.14 got it uh it was one of the greater moments of my life it was on my third

00:10:44.06 controller uh and uh and I was done I was so happy less than like a month later

00:10:50.10 they upped that game mode to have six people in it and it became

00:10:55.15 instantly easier to get it yeah way way way way way easier to get I think I had

00:10:59.07 to get in a rat's nest if memory serves I can't I can't remember all the map

00:11:03.07 names but uh but the point is uh it was very very hard to get and I think part

00:11:07.20 of the reason why it's so frustrating to me and I know it was so frustrating to

00:11:12.04 Bernie is how hard it was for us to do it legitimately for you to just stand

00:11:18.04 three people in a row and kill them um I was very happy to provide video

00:11:22.23 evidence of my achievements because at the time this is before achievement

00:11:27.05 hunter existed at the time I'd still saved the clips in theater mode of all

00:11:32.00 of the moments I got those achievements so I thought I can just go back to these

00:11:36.07 clips now that achievement hunter exists and make a little achievement guide for

00:11:40.03 achievements that I've already got I've got all the clips I've got step and

00:11:43.20 razor I've got the two for one laser I've got overkill I put it up as a video

00:11:48.12 and all I got was utter [ __ ] for both of these people when's the last time you

00:11:53.07 watched this Geoff the video uh I probably haven't seen it

00:11:56.15 in 10 years I don't know okay why I just clip or if you it is found in it no no

00:12:02.08 this is the real question tell me your feelings on this as you watch this video

00:12:06.17 you mean that that guy that he just hit twice who refused to look at him are you

00:12:10.19 already on the overcoat a little bit yeah I already I already

00:12:14.08 watched it uh I can't play a little while ago I still see uh definitely see

00:12:19.09 you cheating to get this achievement this is a video from October 5th 2008

00:12:23.06 which is I assume when I uploaded it um and the first guy I'll admit in my

00:12:27.04 overkill the first guy just doesn't damage me too he does I don't know if he

00:12:30.19 didn't see me or he's just walking backwards but I had the hammer and it was a

00:12:35.06 I probably still got the entire game as a theater mode file I give you the th I

00:12:40.10 think maybe the third kill is legitimate [Laughter]

00:12:46.02 what do you mean I the rest of them are definitely not

00:12:49.18 it's definitely it's okay man and everybody was doing it why would I give

00:12:55.08 you the video if I cheated I who why would you cheat I mean he

00:12:59.08 already saw it I don't know why that would change anything based off of his

00:13:02.21 his previous opinion but I I had never heard of this conflict this was all new

00:13:07.09 to me and it was clear Gavin was passionate about it

00:13:11.12 and Geoff has talked about wanting to do a mystery show of some kind

00:13:15.20 right do we solve a crime what better crime and or mystery to

00:13:19.21 potentially try to solve than gavin's overkill issue so I went deep I did some

00:13:26.00 research oh and digging now now the problem is the video quality is 240p

00:13:32.21 so when I I started to do my research this is there's a moment in which Gavin

00:13:38.14 shows a screen of players trying to decipher that

00:13:42.11 not easy it's completely blurred you can't really make out anybody's names

00:13:47.12 are you gonna try and like contact these people

00:13:50.02 oh feel free son and now and Gavin's this is what helps Gavin is in like

00:13:54.23 February last year bungie got rid of all of their old stats that they used to

00:13:59.09 have for halo on their website so there's no

00:14:03.05 immediately accessible paper trail to this it's just impossible however

00:14:07.04 Gavin thankfully as he mentioned he recorded these as clips and then put

00:14:12.21 them on his file share so a clean version of all these exist on halo 3 but

00:14:17.22 you need to be in halo 3 to get it and halo 3 servers went down I think

00:14:23.01 yesterday it was the whole thing so like once

00:14:26.07 again the timing of this very convenient for you Gavin but I hopped on I hopped

00:14:31.13 on twitter and I was like hey does anyone happen to have a copy of halo 3

00:14:36.23 and and somebody was [ __ ] kind enough to do it they pulled out

00:14:42.13 a copy of halo 3. They even [ __ ] um had to pull out a 360. They

00:14:47.03 had like four console updates they had to go through Matt king was the the kind

00:14:53.05 enough person to be thank you Matt kang for doing this

00:14:56.19 detective work for us so he booted up his 316. He got everything I needed so

00:15:00.20 these were are the screen shots I got from Matt king

00:15:04.23 of all the different player names in the lobby

00:15:06.22 that Gavin interacted with much clearer I can do research so I went on I went on

00:15:11.06 to investigate wait wait wait wait wait wait wait you don't need to investigate

00:15:14.07 any further you just need to free cam that clip what do you mean well are you

00:15:19.05 saying you pulled the theater the mode clip no he did

00:15:23.05 I don't yeah so he could just he could have just uh free cam med the

00:15:26.18 map and watched everyone else fight without me well that already exists

00:15:30.01 there are moments of that but that doesn't necessarily I mean that's a

00:15:33.12 great argument against it being legitimate there's moments within the

00:15:36.12 clip itself in which there is a fight unrelated to Gavin before he has the

00:15:40.10 hand right uh I what was great is I didn't intend

00:15:44.01 for this to [ __ ] with Gavin Gavin got this achievement on the 18th of October

00:15:48.13 2007.

00:15:50.13 And so I randomly last night texted Gavin what were you doing the night of

00:15:53.19 eight on the 18th of October 2007. And he was very confused in a way that he

00:15:57.12 felt like it felt like you thought I was [ __ ] with you I said I don't know but

00:16:02.23 the day before I went bowling yeah he went confirmation on bowling and he had a

00:16:07.16 photo of a pen up his nose from three days later so a definite criminal yeah

00:16:12.15 do you have anybody to post it uh I don't have it immediately on hand

00:16:16.19 uh but if if I could anyway I looked into these people I have a

00:16:21.09 question for you so were you in england at the time yeah Kevin

00:16:25.12 that makes sense because one of the people I looked up ray con 79

00:16:29.21 uh their this is their their profile their bio maybe you can make sense of it

00:16:33.22 to me I know I don't understand or maybe we'll edit out this is what his bio was

00:16:38.00 if you ma'am's a arsenal fan if your mam's a arsenal fan then she should go

00:16:43.01 to hat free market and buy a bag of cypress spuds

00:16:48.21 like all that confirmed to me is that they were also an English there was one

00:16:53.05 of my people right there that's one of your is that an insult I don't know I

00:16:58.12 didn't know is that pro arsenal or anti-arsenal I don't know

00:17:01.23 what are what are the spuds is there significance to Cyprus spuds Gavin you

00:17:06.12 don't know what a spud is no I know what a spot is I know

00:17:11.01 but what is a cypress bud that's a very specific budget bro no

00:17:14.05 okay so that's just don't British people retire to Cyprus a

00:17:18.15 lot isn't that like a big retirement yeah it's popular location hmm so

00:17:23.22 that's the picture two days after Miami that's not the face of a chia

00:17:30.12 so I looked in all these people sadly and I because I'd love for this to be

00:17:36.15 like undeniable Gavin is guilty sadly most of these people

00:17:40.12 no I'd rather be guilty I think it'd be funnier if I was able to me too uh but

00:17:45.12 all of these people none of them got the achievement they

00:17:49.14 didn't get in on that day and they never got it at all we can now belittle

00:17:53.19 we can belittle gavin's achievement though because most of them have only

00:17:57.13 played halo for like one day these are all people that had no idea what they

00:18:02.12 were doing that explains the behavior in the game I got lucky

00:18:06.02 what what what what it explains to me is Gavin said hey I'm having he messaged

00:18:09.23 some people because he was you know a member of the roosties community at

00:18:13.12 this point there were a lot of people out there we were

00:18:15.21 they were a lot we were amongst a lot of gamers of our ilk I think he made

00:18:19.11 probably turned a couple people said hey would you guys want to hop on and help

00:18:22.19 me get this achievement real fast all you guys got to do is just let me kill

00:18:24.00 you once with this hammer real quick and

00:18:26.14 then just go we'll just have fun playing halo together

00:18:29.08 I don't I don't think that's likely I think it's it's more like I think it's

00:18:32.12 very likely no android you've done tremendous work

00:18:36.02 here well I'm not there I'm not quite so the good news as I said bungie got rid

00:18:40.03 of all their stats there's a community initiative going on where they've pulled

00:18:43.09 all the data from that and they're working on uploading it as like an

00:18:47.05 independent thing and it sounded like that might be

00:18:49.11 available by like the end of this month so I'm hoping to have the game locks

00:18:54.00 because I was able to look into all these people however the most damaging

00:18:58.19 thing about this is by far the most suspicious of the kills is soul leader

00:19:03.01 your first one where he looks at you and then just does nothing and turns back

00:19:07.12 the other way yeah he he does not exist on Xbox I don't know who this person is

00:19:12.14 I reached out to major nelson on twitter about it no reply wasn't able to get

00:19:17.14 clarification for a question I had that's okay busy man but he doesn't

00:19:21.11 exist and that's really like if you wanted anyone to clear your name it is

00:19:26.02 soul leader but the one account that is soul leader

00:19:29.11 on Xbox has only played fantasy star online so it's a different account so

00:19:34.12 either soul eater was suspended or I think more likely they changed their

00:19:38.20 game could be cheating can't rule that out that's why I was

00:19:42.07 trying to get in contact with major nelson to find the back story of soul

00:19:45.09 leader I also love that in the photo soul eater you can see the guy's

00:19:48.12 reflection but like you can't make an id it adds to the mystery of whose soul

00:19:52.13 leader is I spent so much time trying to

00:19:54.19 track that guy down I do think that that first kill is pretty suspect also the

00:19:59.02 last kill when Gavin swings the sword or swings the hammer at the guy the guy

00:20:02.10 looks at Gavin and then looks to the left and then lets Gavin kill him again

00:20:06.06 is pretty [ __ ] suspect there's some definite I'm watching this thing again

00:20:10.17 the first guy uh okay there's a fight going on there's no way

00:20:15.12 this would be yeah smack okay uh I'm in a bubble oh so this isn't the

00:20:19.13 spree I'm I've put a bit of head on this

00:20:21.20 apparently there is a little bit of head on yeah that guy is just not doing

00:20:25.05 anything no he's useless like he he doesn't it's the most suspicious as I

00:20:28.15 said of all them well Gavin only needed him to have that account for one day so

00:20:32.23 that is true most of the accounts feel like they only existed for one day uh

00:20:36.20 the only one that had any history on it was the the man's an arsenal fan guy I

00:20:42.04 messaged several people on his friends list if they had any memory of them and

00:20:45.14 I didn't get a reply back from anybody I tried I did a thorough investigation

00:20:50.07 or at least as thorough as I could get I think there's a really really good

00:20:53.19 chance that uh at least a couple of these accounts are Gavin you think so

00:20:57.11 you think yeah David had a ton of accounts back in the

00:21:00.11 day he had a big thing about like tricking people into changing their

00:21:03.18 gamer tags he's he's he was hyper obsessed with gamer tags and accounts

00:21:08.19 back then a British account two game attacks well that you cop up to

00:21:13.14 yeah that's true you acknowledge as yours of course that you've said are yours

00:21:18.05 I will say this the the uh person that helped on twitter pulled this all

00:21:22.00 together they thought you were undeniably guilty of staging oh my god

00:21:26.11 freaking fire around the map dude fly around everyone's fired

00:21:30.23 they felt very strongly so I know I think it could be interesting the people

00:21:35.17 can watch it is in a video that I linked

00:21:38.04 um I'm sure there will be some way maybe you should just read it's on the site

00:21:41.21 too but it's not the video quality isn't any different it's halo 3

00:21:45.15 overkill step and razor two for one mongoose mowdown guide rooster teeth you

00:21:50.04 can find what happened to that file by the way 240p how did I capture it so low

00:21:54.19 I don't know it's not like hd wasn't already around that must have been

00:21:58.21 captured in at least 720 I would say so there you have it face and there you

00:22:03.07 have it audience uh this is our first and then nick if you could cut in some

00:22:08.13 like law and order or mystery type music right here first mystery

00:22:12.00 face is gonna solve the mystery hopefully with the help of the uh with

00:22:16.06 the comment levers and the regulation listeners is Gavin the cheat that we all

00:22:22.02 suspect he is let's get to the bottom of it

00:22:24.17 okay now we have our 2022 mystery this is our first true crime

00:22:29.01 this is a yeah this is our first it's not a I guess the the mur that it'd be

00:22:33.22 the murder of gavin's uh uh honesty and character okay yes I would say

00:22:38.06 not guilty based on my investigation but maybe people can go out with the the

00:22:42.17 information shared and find stuff I didn't find I fully fully condone

00:22:47.18 delving in as deep as possible to this clip um the truth will be clear

00:22:55.14 as clear as 240p can be yeah you did you did a great job Andrew uh

00:23:03.20 unfortunately the results are inconclusive you end up uh

00:23:07.20 and there's the problem uh I think with well I mean it's a strength and a

00:23:12.20 weakness right I think you tend to see the the good in people uh which is a

00:23:18.02 great human quality but as an investigator it can be can can cloud

00:23:21.12 judgment uh the person that you uh involved that involved in it was

00:23:25.03 convinced Gavin sheeted I am convinced Gavin cheated basically uh everyone

00:23:29.05 that's known Gavin for most of his life is convinced he cheated take that for

00:23:33.15 what it's worth but maybe the audience can help uh can help us elucidate this

00:23:38.05 matter that would be great any additional information would be awesome

00:23:41.04 I hope those things get posted at the end of the month so I could go in and

00:23:44.02 look at specifically the stats because I feel like that could also be a big

00:23:47.22 indicator of thanks but we need here's what we need here's what we need you

00:23:51.13 know how we have the phenomenal Vancouver child kicker poster that that

00:23:55.19 you can put up with information about the Vancouver child kicker if you can

00:23:59.06 contact us we need a did Gavin cheat banner that people can put up like a

00:24:04.04 poster a flyer people could put up at the coffee shops if you have information

00:24:09.18 on Gavin uh whether he cheated or not in this halo

00:24:12.19 game can you email bits at facepod.com or whatever it is I don't even know what

00:24:17.12 our email address is I want I want a just a billboard of the names when Gavin

00:24:22.19 shows the lobby on this thing that 240p pixely thing on a giant billboard

00:24:27.22 just can people complaining it making no

00:24:30.15 sense no context no information just the worst billboard ever made

00:24:35.17 not enough 240p billboards out there

00:24:39.03 that's really I swear it wasn't 240p originally I think youtube's like shut

00:24:44.18 the bed on that video it was like the the base file as you

00:24:49.12 said I think halo 3 was 720p so I think somehow in the transferring process

00:24:54.07 and Gavin was so ahead of the game in tech back then too that the only way

00:24:58.08 that video could be 240p if he knew that that was the only way that he could

00:25:02.01 adequately obscure the tags so that no further investigation could be done.

00:25:08.05 [Applause]

00:29:02.12 I have one other mystery that I've been I've been sitting on a little bit in my

00:29:06.15 personal life so I fixed the bed is fixed I've talked

00:29:10.13 about fix before I just the box spring arrived oh I gained a box spring I lost

00:29:15.08 a bed frame my bed frame is now broken so you're off the slats

00:29:18.20 I'm off the slacks I've I've upgraded from the slats

00:29:22.10 built it like it's all good it was the night it was finished I laid down in bed

00:29:27.07 I was very comfortable and I was just looking at the play store

00:29:30.12 and I decided I'm gonna buy this shitty two dollar mobile game why not this

00:29:34.19 seems like a great time so I go to buy it and they asked me to

00:29:37.20 put in my gmail password for it and I don't remember what it is and I have it

00:29:41.21 saved on my computer but I just didn't feel like getting up out of bed I just

00:29:45.13 laid down I was cozy so I just guessed I was like I'm just gonna guess I've got

00:29:49.07 like six or seven in my head that I think it

00:29:51.23 could be so I just go through the list of those and none of them work and then

00:29:56.02 it gets to the point where it's like hey you've run out of tries you can't you

00:29:59.09 can't try anymore do you want to like reset your password

00:30:02.20 I don't need to reset my password because I can easily like it's fine I

00:30:06.21 don't necessarily need this two-dollar mobile game but I was like you know what

00:30:10.15 I don't even this is how little I feel like getting out of bed right now I'm

00:30:14.07 just gonna reset my password and then it's fine then I can just buy this thing

00:30:18.21 so I reset my password no problem doing it go through the thing ask me to verify

00:30:24.23 code it sends it to my alternate email great awesome new password

00:30:30.00 when you sign out of or change a password on like a gmail account and you

00:30:34.17 have two-factor authentication on it it signs you out everywhere as soon as

00:30:38.07 you do it yeah so I change my password then I go to sign into my account and it

00:30:44.08 says okay we need to verify this is you we have pushed an alert to your your

00:30:47.21 Google pixel click yes and you're in and nothing comes there's there's just

00:30:53.11 nothing shows up on my pixel so I'm like okay that didn't work try

00:30:56.10 again so then it says okay we'll text you

00:30:59.09 we'll text you at this number and then put in the code it's my last phone

00:31:02.20 number for some reason I never changed my phone number it's my previous phone

00:31:06.23 number and I'm like oh [ __ ] okay we'll try again so I click try again and it

00:31:11.14 says okay we're gonna email you a verification code to the email you're

00:31:16.11 locked out of just put that in and then you're all good

00:31:21.05 for some reason has just decided my alternate email doesn't exist I have

00:31:26.15 hacked my own account I cannot get into my gmail I lost access in my gmail

00:31:30.14 Sunday night I have yet to be able to get back in I kept trying to the point

00:31:34.18 where it said you can no longer attempt to even recover this email but I'm in a

00:31:39.03 stage now where I've given them alternate

00:31:41.14 information and they're like we will get back to you after 48 hours which is a

00:31:45.13 really weird phrasing of what we'll get back to you because it could be months

00:31:49.04 from now I don't know when I'm gonna get my personal email back and all I wanted

00:31:55.01 to do was download a two dollar rock star a rock band clone it was a dumb mobile

00:31:58.23 game and I've lost everything all because your bed was too comfy well

00:32:03.12 because my bed was too comfy and I fixed it and I it just it [ __ ] is crazy to

00:32:08.01 me that they will not recognize that I have an email that isn't the fact it

00:32:12.07 keeps saying we'll send you verification

00:32:14.15 code to your email that you're trying to get into is insane and I'm sure that

00:32:19.12 that's my fault I somehow [ __ ] that up at some point but just there's another

00:32:24.05 email there that you asked me for when I changed my password why have you now

00:32:30.02 decided that that isn't valid this has been my pain I don't know what

00:32:33.07 to do I didn't even know I don't ever memorize my own phone number so I didn't

00:32:38.06 remember what the number was so that's why on slack a few days ago I passed I

00:32:42.05 posted hey do any of you guys have a number that ends with these numbers how

00:32:46.10 do you not remember your phone number so I I do do you need it no I remembered

00:32:51.20 that on amazon they have numbers saved with previous

00:32:54.12 addresses so it's able to find it that way the reason why I don't remember my

00:32:59.04 phone number Gavin is because my dad took my number when I was a teenager

00:33:03.16 he was paying for my phone plan and he was getting rid of one phone and he's

00:33:08.01 like yeah I need your number so he just took my phone number

00:33:12.03 and I just have refused to ever learn a number past that

00:33:15.15 ever since that point I just don't they're I have I don't remember it's

00:33:19.13 such an annoyance wouldn't your friends at the time text your dad by accident I

00:33:23.14 know I just I wouldn't use I never use my phone I'm not a phone guy

00:33:27.12 nobody I interacted with would text me use different messaging services for

00:33:31.22 that purpose um there are no texts going on so if I

00:33:35.07 text your old number am I talking to your dad

00:33:38.12 no a number before you never knew that number I don't think I don't think you

00:33:42.13 were aware of that phone number so am I texting if I text that number that you

00:33:46.10 asked that's the thing I don't know and my hope is

00:33:49.20 is that that I don't know if that number is even in service so it's like maybe I

00:33:53.17 should just call the number and see if somebody's there because if I can get

00:33:57.13 the code from them then I'm totally fine I believe I don't think there's any

00:34:01.13 other issues should I call just text that number and say hey can you can you

00:34:05.13 just post the code you're about to get to this number but they can ignore the

00:34:09.19 text like I don't I don't know yeah that they can ignore that text or they could

00:34:14.07 answer it you'll never know but if I just you'll contact anybody on

00:34:18.04 earth you would call you would try to contact the president for an interview

00:34:21.03 if you could but you're scared to contact the owner of your old phone just

00:34:24.15 text them right now well it's the just the texting mechanism

00:34:27.20 is what I don't trust like I don't if it's not act like what if it's just not

00:34:31.11 active I'm just wasting my time and I'm mad at

00:34:34.22 this non-existing person and if it's not active

00:34:38.16 I think I theoretically could get that number back if I went back to the

00:34:44.02 previous company service that's interesting

00:34:46.17 because there have been times where I've been locked out of accounts and then

00:34:49.23 I've just copied the email I recreated the email that didn't exist

00:34:53.13 and then I was able to get in because I was sending it to the new email that I

00:34:55.20 made that was labeled I'm going to call I'm going to call this let's see if this

00:34:59.09 is I'm going to call now yeah okay the number you were calling

00:35:03.14 unavailable please try again later that uh uh oh that's a phone that is

00:35:10.13 off or not in service I think yeah unfortunate okay well no that's

00:35:15.12 actually kind of a positive because I can then

00:35:18.15 yeah if it doesn't have a voicemail it's it's uh it's been gone a while I think

00:35:22.23 yeah probably I'm gonna look into this I'm gonna I'm gonna see if I can get my

00:35:26.20 old number back but that has been my annoyance is the fact that I essentially

00:35:30.15 hacked into my own account and Google is protecting me from getting into my

00:35:34.10 account you should try to get that number quickly

00:35:38.23 as quickly as possible before I get it before how can I figure out how to get

00:35:43.20 it no you would care because you'll never you'll never get that [ __ ] code

00:35:47.10 I guarantee you that [Laughter]

00:35:50.00 I'm hmm I don't know if yeah I don't know if you want to go to war Geoff

00:35:55.05 I'd find a way retaliate I know you would I know you would

00:36:00.00 port-a-potty's just the beginning

00:36:02.15 yeah I wouldn't mess with them that's wave one should I talk about the uh

00:36:08.01 absolute face I did to myself last night in bed

00:36:11.14 oh I'm so excited dude please yeah I just had probably the shortest duration

00:36:17.15 face the most instant face that I've ever experienced

00:36:22.21 go on I was in bed uh trying to watch um

00:36:26.00 not to talk about bo Burnham again but I was trying to watch his

00:36:30.17 show that just went on Netflix for ages ago with meg and the apple tv remote is

00:36:36.06 an utter piece of [ __ ] I don't know if you've experienced this turd

00:36:40.23 um yeah I've had so many experiences where like the skip ahead 10 seconds and

00:36:46.13 skip back 10 seconds on this on the time

00:36:48.12 on the on the sides just stopped working after a while like I've I've had these

00:36:53.03 replaced before I'm at I'm at the point where this one where I'm just like this

00:36:56.20 is so bad you so the clicks on the side stop working so it doesn't skip back 10

00:37:01.12 seconds each time so you end up trying to actually like manually moving the

00:37:05.20 play head on a video around and it's just skipping all over the place and I'm

00:37:08.23 getting annoyed I'm like this shitty thing and meg's laughing at me because I

00:37:12.12 complain about this damn thing constantly so she's making fun of me

00:37:16.19 that I just don't do anything about it um and I like to do things just rat like

00:37:21.12 I like to surprise meg in quite extreme ways sometimes for example she recently

00:37:26.06 told me um that I've been wearing a shirt too long because it had a hole in

00:37:29.20 it and she's been staring this hole for years so I just put my finger through it

00:37:33.08 and just tore the shirt off my body like I hulked out of it and she thought that

00:37:36.22 was funny so I thought you know I'm gonna I'm gonna do something about this

00:37:41.03 apple remote so in the middle of the conversation of me complaining about

00:37:46.10 this apple remote I just out of nowhere snapped it in half I just snapped it

00:37:50.05 right down the middle and what it felt like was that someone threw a cup of

00:37:55.01 sand in my face and then I just heard what sounded like

00:37:59.14 sand raining all over both of us and the bed turns out they're made of glass

00:38:07.18 the whole thing is glass I sho tiny shards of glass into my eyes and face

00:38:16.21 all over both of us raining down on the entire bedroom at like 11 p.m

00:38:23.12 and I'm just sat I'm just sat there with glass in my

00:38:28.13 hair and my chest hair in my in my cup of tea on my nightstand.

00:38:40.15 I'm like wow one actual definition of her face I shot myself in the foot

00:38:46.21 because just for a joke what an idiot I had to strip the bed sheets

00:38:53.18 I'm hoovering up I'm hovering at this tiny like sand glass from the entire

00:38:58.17 room I can't find a single piece of floor that doesn't look like it's

00:39:03.14 covered in glitter changing the sheets we're laughing about at first then after

00:39:08.20 like you know 10 minutes we're just like what a move right like what a

00:39:13.22 turn like winding down for the evening uh so then I'm putting the sheets on and

00:39:18.06 putting the replacement sheets on dragging the sheets over the bottom

00:39:22.06 corner of the bed pushing down suddenly I just hear it and

00:39:27.00 my face hits the bed I tear the brand new bed sheet

00:39:31.07 that's putting it on around the mattress my face hits the bed I'm on my knees at

00:39:36.15 this point and I'm just like I need to go to bed I don't know what's

00:39:40.23 wrong with this sort of 30 minute period but I'm not having a good time in it

00:39:46.19 it's everything's going wrong so those were my uh bed problems my bed face from

00:39:52.07 last night do you do you think do you think they

00:39:55.23 were unrelated or do you think one related to like you connected because of

00:40:01.09 the remote that you somehow you what if your fingers had thousands

00:40:06.15 of tiny microscopic pieces of glass embedded in there and now you just have

00:40:11.14 like razor hands and you ripped the sheets with your little tiny

00:40:14.18 shark tooth Gavin glass hands I honestly had glass all over my hat

00:40:20.10 that thing I highly I highly recommend when you get annoyed

00:40:25.07 at that thing just put it in the bin don't do that too

00:40:29.01 you guys uh you guys got to stay away from your bedrooms they're dangerous

00:40:34.04 how's your bedroom been recently Geoff it's fine totally fine no problems no

00:40:39.00 issues don't even talk about it [Laughter]

00:40:42.11 you [ __ ] cut a hole through your bed with your your glass hands I know that's

00:40:48.10 unbelievable so it's a shitty remote but if you want

00:40:52.04 to turn into wolverine very cheaply all you have to do

00:40:56.10 if you need a weapon quickly just snap one of those puppies

00:41:00.17 you can be it's like you know how like the joker would leave a joker card at

00:41:05.06 the scene of the crime Gavin glass hands slices a hole

00:41:08.22 in the front corner of the bed [Laughter]

00:41:15.22 that didn't disappoint you still seeing stuff though right

00:41:21.18 you don't have glass in your eyes like you you're okay it's a trade

00:41:27.09 you have no vision but you can cut through any bed you want [Laughter]

00:41:32.19 so that's why I text you last night uh I just faced the [ __ ] out of myself you

00:41:38.19 said podcast story I said yes just changed the bedsheets you said

00:41:43.07 tomorrow's gonna be incredible oh and I was right what makes me so happy

00:41:48.21 is I was so cozy in bed when I got that text I was just all comfortable relaxed

00:41:55.00 yeah I was about 20 minutes earlier are you scared now that if you meet bo

00:42:00.05 Burnham he's just gonna die immediately or like something horrible

00:42:04.13 what happened to him like you seem to have this fandom for

00:42:08.12 this person but every engagement you have with them is a negative in some way

00:42:12.17 well this remote has not been working on many

00:42:16.00 more shows than this bo Burnham show though but I don't think they're related

00:42:20.02 what's the breaking point we're going to find out that Gavin is the carrier of a

00:42:23.23 disease that only beau Burnham is susceptible to.

00:42:28.15 I mean just to be sure I'll try and avoid him unfortunately but um yeah as

00:42:33.23 long as I can still watch his according to his content he's had it

00:42:38.02 hard enough man he doesn't need you in his life oh he's like

00:42:45.12 he's like an alien from war of the worlds and Gavin has the one thing

00:42:50.22 that he hasn't been exposed to his next special is just called Gavin can you

00:42:55.08 imagine how disappointed gab would be if he found out that bo Burnham liked the

00:42:59.22 most recent matrix movie that would understand everything it would be

00:43:03.12 nothing more disappointing remember the thing I said about

00:43:07.12 pleasantries never have them with bo barnum spend as little time with him as

00:43:11.17 possible in the future look other people's opinions on movies aren't make

00:43:15.03 or break to the relationship they really mean nothing

00:43:17.23 you said you wouldn't cease to be my friend if I liked that movie I strongly

00:43:21.23 I think you know I was just trying to get you to watch the movie

00:43:26.12 why would that make me want to watch the movie instead an incentive

00:43:31.09 I really didn't say that I was like I'll think less of you as a person no you

00:43:37.05 said it would end our friendship and you

00:43:40.00 would cease to make this podcast yes you did

00:43:42.15 you would disown anybody that thought that that movie was great

00:43:46.11 oh well if you like that movie that's fine I would just write it yeah that's

00:43:50.04 the I just uh I just didn't really like it that's not the thing a lot of people

00:43:55.06 love it a lot of people love it I can see why they do I list when we were

00:43:59.12 playing halo Trevor brought up that he enjoyed it and

00:44:02.08 it sounded like a real tip toe enjoyed because he knew the bear was there the

00:44:05.17 matrix bear was there and he would not tolerate Gavin would not allow him to

00:44:10.00 god the fourth matrix Gavin glass hands would be all over him if he said he

00:44:14.09 enjoyed that film

00:44:16.21 oh I should watch it now well now that I

00:44:20.21 know that it won't enter a friendship I I might watch it no I really I hope you

00:44:25.12 like it I hope you do I'm sad that I didn't maybe that's our next tuxedo

00:44:30.12 watching I still haven't heard back from the director of the tuxedo I sent him

00:44:34.04 one more email yesterday my last one I'm hopeful but I don't I don't think we're

00:44:39.16 gonna get it I'm telling you you have created an enemy

00:44:42.14 I don't want an enemy I want a friend Geoff I'm trying to make a friend

00:44:46.14 well you're going about it in a weird way yeah don't insult someone and give

00:44:49.19 them your phone number that's not how you make friends I do you know the only

00:44:53.09 movie you were lucky enough to make in your life we made fun of it do you want

00:44:58.08 to be my friend I I didn't I didn't that's like I

00:45:02.02 understand what you're saying when you say it on paper it is a terrible idea

00:45:06.04 but genuinely I was hoping for a friendship with the director of the

00:45:09.22 tuxedo and I still think it's possible I still believe I had a movie blunder of

00:45:16.06 my own this week I was yeah I was trying to watch um

00:45:20.06 I wanted to watch beer fest because Geoff said it had that

00:45:23.22 moment where the guy dies and then his brother comes along and but just is that

00:45:29.20 guy sure yeah yeah I was like 80 minutes into the movie and I was like when is

00:45:33.12 this guy gonna show up realized I watched I was watching beer league which

00:45:39.07 is the already laying movie live movie Ralph macchio oh my god I was

00:45:44.01 like 18 minutes into that I was like I oh [ __ ] it was bear fest

00:45:49.21 oh dude you're 80. Wow you're 80 minutes in

00:45:55.11 very similar sounding films yeah no that's true and they came out

00:46:00.13 around the same time too actually yeah purely oh man

00:46:04.12 beer league is no dirty work I'll say that oh oh yeah no it was a dirty work a

00:46:10.02 much better movie hey did we ever talk about how

00:46:13.07 you guys probably killed Betty white ah well I wouldn't take that one

00:46:18.10 yeah that was that's I mean maybe considering the timing of when the

00:46:22.13 episode came out but when we actually talked about Betty white it wasn't

00:46:25.22 really anywhere near that no it was quite a long time ago we

00:46:28.16 killed truly scrumptious no doubt about it that was like the next day but

00:46:33.18 yeah do you think it would be would it be a bad taste to just like say

00:46:38.10 would that be bad [Music]

00:46:40.12 what do you have against no I'm just you know what

00:46:46.06 andrew's trying to [ __ ] kill no guys like a national treasure

00:46:51.11 what are you doing listen I'm not the one with glass all over my hands right

00:46:57.03 now I'm just I'm saying I was just bringing up the name why would you risk it

00:47:02.02 he was the first person to survive coven for christ's sake yeah didn't we use

00:47:07.11 this what we I love well stop saying his name stop saying his name

00:47:12.04 I'm a big fan what's wrong with you I'm a big fan of seriously of all people

00:47:17.16 you could pick you could pick like the most beloved guy in Hollywood oh I was

00:47:22.12 just saying like wouldn't that that would be sad if that what are you doing

00:47:27.01 oh stop why don't you keep saying it uh okay um well who um

00:47:32.02 it doesn't work that way if you want to kill somebody they don't die it's only

00:47:37.22 people that you like and I love it's great I love flop stop saying it

00:47:43.11 uh I haven't liked his most recent films how about that is that okay

00:47:48.09 like I didn't see a lot of them the hologram and the kings I like I

00:47:52.04 didn't see that the circle was that what the the

00:47:55.22 internet movie was that he was in with with oh boy I said another one oh no

00:48:02.00 how do I navigate this I mean it doesn't work intentionally so

00:48:06.07 hopefully he's safe yeah yeah no I'm sure it's fine it's also all [ __ ]

00:48:09.07 none of this matters so I don't know what we're doing well that's true oh

00:48:13.22 it's obviously uh sure obviously obviously complete [ __ ]

00:48:17.02 but still complete but still all that does is say something about you

00:48:24.17 are there anything that you're supernatural about like that like you

00:48:28.17 have a routine like what's what's a routine thing for you that like doesn't

00:48:32.11 actually make sense but you you feel is true something that you

00:48:37.05 believe is dreaming yeah like a little superstition yeah um

00:48:40.17 I mean I don't walk under ladders but that's nothing to do with superstition

00:48:44.15 it's just someone could drop something on your

00:48:47.05 head yeah when a stick has fallen from the sky and hit you I could understand

00:48:51.11 having a general not trust of things from above

00:48:54.21 uh I must have some I just can't think of any really not a single

00:48:59.18 suit not that's born out of fear I do a lot of stuff out of routine like I draw

00:49:05.07 a like a little face in the shower on the wind like in the glass every shower

00:49:10.08 I take and I can't really shower until I do yeah

00:49:13.12 could you recreate the shower outside of the shower can it only be in the shower

00:49:18.02 that you feel it's just only in the steam of a shower then I draw the little

00:49:21.21 little face I've been doing it for years

00:49:24.03 every shower I've taken hmm I don't know

00:49:25.23 why but now I have to do it because I've been doing it you know you like you're

00:49:29.14 like it's been like

00:49:32.02 there's no ears what type of mouth you don't look up in a shower no you do well

00:49:38.19 it depends the if is your back facing like if your back is then looking up is

00:49:44.15 nice yeah it's really positional it's a position to look up

00:49:48.14 but not all scenarios speak you know what hey

00:49:52.04 something I wanted to talk about I don't think Gavin is aware of this

00:49:56.03 we have we have faith speaking of celebrities we have faced our own our

00:50:01.07 own thing our own what we've we've predicted has come true Gavin.

00:50:11.12 I know it's a terrible way of setting that up

00:50:15.05 what is the uh [ __ ] this is so [ __ ]

00:50:18.00 Funny to me this is so funny to me it's very funny so

00:50:22.23 I'm sure it is you gonna say it yeah I'm getting there just give me a minute

00:50:28.07 john cena is making a peacekeeper podcast on on on

00:50:31.12 the rooster teeth network yeah and it was recently reported on by variety

00:50:37.09 uh I'm gonna variety magazine the variety one of the the the high I'd

00:50:42.15 say the highest profile entertainment magazine in in la in Hollywood I would

00:50:48.09 say is that wrong it's definitely top three variety in Hollywood reporter

00:50:52.13 would be the they're the only games in town they're the top ones

00:50:56.05 so it's a mention of that this podcast is going to be made by by rooster teeth

00:50:59.14 and in a part of it there's an extra that says other podcasts from rooster

00:51:05.01 teeth produced from studios in la and Austin Texas include face jam

00:51:09.20 off topic black box down red web and the long running rooster teeth

00:51:14.08 podcast which now numbers more than 500

00:51:18.12 episode we were left off that list we were not

00:51:24.04 really really faced ourselves there I wonder if we should just run an ad for

00:51:29.14 face on the john cena podcast that would

00:51:31.23 can we do that that'd be great if that's a thing we can do I I think going

00:51:35.12 forward any mention of variety nick make sure you believe part of it yeah make

00:51:39.13 sure it's blape we're no longer we got a censor part of their name so like right

00:51:44.21 now I'm saying lady like that doesn't come through unbleeped no there's at

00:51:49.22 least a bleep in it any any time we also should have bleeped all

00:51:55.01 no yeah let's bleep all of going forward this is how they'll be known

00:52:00.00 the star star rioty um I just love the idea that this like

00:52:03.22 prestigious Hollywood writer or company whatever

00:52:07.22 they're looking at a list of things and that they have to decide if they're

00:52:12.08 going to include face or not but the fact that there needs to be

00:52:16.15 some level of dialogue at some stage of this process in which

00:52:19.18 they need to either make the decision to include a podcast named face or not at

00:52:25.20 all when they didn't which I get it understand completely

00:52:29.02 but it's hilarious I told Andrew last night

00:52:32.11 that it or whenever we talked about it that uh

00:52:35.17 it it was kind of a perfect virtuous moment because I got so [ __ ]

00:52:41.12 infuriated like furious like I was gonna yell at people upset that we weren't in

00:52:46.07 it that we didn't get that we got uh one of the you know which no offense to

00:52:49.12 those other podcasts they're all great but you know we're larger than most of

00:52:52.15 them and and we're doing very well for ourselves uh considering uh our name and

00:52:58.06 uh in spite of our name and then I realized

00:53:01.12 that this is why I wanted to name it face because I wanted to face ourselves

00:53:07.12 right and the fact that I got so angry in such a brief little window of time

00:53:13.05 because we were excluded from that moment you actually podcast yeah I was

00:53:18.21 actually angry means that the podcast is

00:53:21.18 so successful that it means this much to me that it made me mad which made me

00:53:24.23 happy because then I thought oh so we've we've arrived we've made it we're

00:53:28.09 successful enough that I'm mad when we don't get mentioned so it was like a

00:53:32.17 perfect moment where I went from anger to bliss in a like that

00:53:37.23 just to I pause Gavin let me continue from from the the the story rooster

00:53:43.03 teeth also operates the roost podcast network which features partners such as

00:53:49.03 the h3 podcast this might get weird with grace held big

00:53:52.23 and memory heart Philip defranco's a conversation with and kind of funny

00:53:56.20 they name every other podcast not even ones directly affiliated with they name

00:54:01.10 all of them and to be clear this isn't for me at all a thing of like we deserve

00:54:05.05 to be on there that's why I'm annoyed by it I love the idea just because of our

00:54:10.06 name alone that we have to be in those conversations

00:54:12.16 and they have to have meetings in which they include do we do we talk about this

00:54:16.14 yeah it's like reading that you know we've been explicitly ignored there's no

00:54:21.21 way they could have listed us undeniably excluded like without a doubt

00:54:27.01 maybe they're just saving it maybe they're going to do an exclusive

00:54:31.18 face interview an article dedicated to the podcast and

00:54:35.12 they're just saving it maybe when uh the the director of the tuxedo directs the

00:54:40.19 child kicker movie we can get into variety through that

00:54:44.09 be the perfect transition Hollywood connection

00:54:48.07 right together it's funny that this name like because the company there are

00:54:52.14 people at the company who have real jobs and doing like you know real analytics

00:54:57.01 trying to see what's working looking at the growth and

00:55:00.06 faces on those like with graphs and stuff and like projections and it's like

00:55:04.15 yeah why it's called face of course it's not gonna be

00:55:08.01 of course it can't be huge what do you want let's read the name [Laughter]

00:55:13.18 it makes me it's the best part it's I think a fair trade of search ability

00:55:18.21 versus the hilarity of anybody having anyone that has to deal with the name of

00:55:24.11 our show or any part of it that is outside of it

00:55:28.05 brings me eternal happiness it makes me laugh every time

00:55:32.00 did you see what nick typed when the director of the tuxedo follows a

00:55:36.05 restraining order against Andrew will finally make it in the video

00:55:40.19 I will say unfortunately we wouldn't be the first face in variety I was curious

00:55:46.11 so I looked on their thing there is one opinion article about something bill

00:55:50.17 maher said in like 2011 in which they quote him as saying

00:55:54.10 so it wouldn't be the first so they're not opposed to writing that at least in

00:56:00.00 2012 they weren't and they didn't even censor it like us classy individuals

00:56:04.01 we've done we've done the work for them we even bleep it in our own show.

00:56:08.15 [Laughter]

00:56:09.17 Couldn't be classier about it I think it's time Andrew that you

00:56:13.01 reached out to uh variety and see uh see

00:56:15.12 what the hell's going on over there yeah gotta investigate I just I'd love

00:56:20.08 war on all media war on all media yeah we talked about that

00:56:24.22 we did we should just write writing an email where that is the subject line war

00:56:30.06 on all media this name keeps delivering it does well

00:56:33.18 preventing deliveries we keep [ __ ]

00:56:36.14 ourselves it's uh it's kind of perfect I enjoy hearing

00:56:40.13 different takes on the name like bleep face some people say bleep face some say

00:56:45.11 f-face some say the actual name of the show

00:56:48.17 hearing the different takes I always find interesting

00:56:52.03 I I'd like to I haven't told many people if you've recommended this podcast in

00:56:56.05 person to somebody I'd like to know what that story is the read like the

00:56:59.20 expression read what telling somebody you should listen to and then name of

00:57:04.17 show am I alone no I was I was just imagining

00:57:08.01 that scenario I realized that that prevented me from saying anything but I

00:57:11.09 was just picturing it no yeah so you guys both you guys both [ __ ] vanished

00:57:16.06 off the face to the point where I thought the law had once again won I

00:57:20.00 thought I was dealing with another live show we were here and I was getting

00:57:23.07 apologies in the moment yeah just listening to you man you're

00:57:26.16 that interesting well I would bring I want to bring up another podcast for a

00:57:30.20 moment Gavin mentioned on the rooster teeth podcast that somebody he knows

00:57:35.03 listen to a really broken episode um because it was like there were talks

00:57:40.12 about it being one of our best episodes so they it was their first experience

00:57:44.00 with it and you brought up so many great points that I didn't even consider

00:57:48.23 where the first 10 minutes of that episode is

00:57:51.22 us yelling about the law a thing that we never talk about within the episode

00:57:56.19 itself you have had to have listened to the previous one that any context we

00:58:01.18 never explain what that is then it transitions into a visual gag

00:58:06.20 yeah car stuff which you can't see then it goes into a discussion about the

00:58:12.08 plane window where we don't explain the original

00:58:16.09 scenario again it's also a holdover from the week before and he was like this is

00:58:20.13 the shittiest podcast anything that's happening

00:58:23.16 for half an hour nothing's happened what are you talking about it's it's a mess

00:58:28.03 and I never even think about that but it's absolutely fair our quote best

00:58:33.12 podcast is probably the worst introductory podcast you could possibly

00:58:37.11 submit it to a friend unless you give a cheat sheet we should make a cheat sheet

00:58:43.07 for that podcast here's what you need to know to listen to this podcast

00:58:47.06 that's like a pop-up video style cheat sheet that's an interesting uh also I

00:58:52.01 think that you I don't remember it was recently I think in a podcast you I

00:58:57.03 thought perfectly nailed it when you described this podcast as deep lore

00:59:00.15 about nothing I can't think of another episode that better exemplifies deep

00:59:05.12 lore about nothing than what you just described yeah yes

00:59:09.20 it's it's great I feel like if you did we even do it I don't think we did we no

00:59:15.02 Kevin David yeah awesome holy [ __ ] you did an intro hey I

00:59:19.09 bet you 10 grand I've done an intro dad wait did we no

00:59:26.04 can someone check the tapes did we put a

00:59:29.22 put a cap to that you can't just do that now there's no way that that's allowed

00:59:35.11 I now owe you a pencil and 10 grand

00:59:40.23 what what's on the uh what continues to be left on the redemption docket are we

00:59:46.06 getting the marathon and the pencil this year what's happening uh

00:59:49.12 marathon is is in the docket it is it's like it's a thing that well honestly the

00:59:53.10 thing of the marathon I want to find a way that I can update my progress live I

00:59:57.12 feel like that'd be the most fun way to track that

01:00:00.08 and I haven't been able to find a device that would do that in a way that anyone

01:00:05.01 could look at like if you could just pull it up like a live

01:00:08.20 distance tracker can't you do the strava app or one of those

01:00:12.22 I don't know what that is something there's like fitness apps that you can

01:00:16.13 record yeah let's track because we like yeah yeah we can get you

01:00:19.12 okay well if you can find me about two bucks on a cell phone uh you're gonna

01:00:22.15 need a Google account though so we'll need to work that out first that is that

01:00:27.20 is an issue I wanna redo donkey Kong country or whatever donkey Kong 64. Yeah

01:00:33.01 on your list Andrew the donkey Kong guy uh and now well I made a face twitch

01:00:38.16 account because you and I were gonna do another halo thing and then you just

01:00:42.04 never you never agreed to another level to work out oh right so it left dormant

01:00:47.18 uh so I'd probably do it on that not Andrew the donkey Kong guy

01:00:52.17 what else is in the redemption is that are those the main things well

01:00:57.14 let me let me put this to you um you know the overkill achievement in halo 3

01:01:02.07 yes did you cheat to get it almost certainly like almost without a doubt

01:01:07.02 like almost undeniably I was probably cheated yeah like without a doubt but

01:01:12.00 I'm not lying about it that's nice neither am I

01:01:15.05 but you're one of the best gamers I know it would be relatively soon

01:01:18.21 I was excited to get it because I'm me and an overkill is like a once a quarter

01:01:24.19 occurrence to me I think I'm trying to remember

01:01:27.05 because there was a time I may have gotten that achievement twice and I

01:01:30.11 think the second time I definitely I'll have to check I'll

01:01:33.14 check my old gamer tag to see if I got it I think I may have got it

01:01:36.15 legitimately on that one but the second time I definitely would have cheated hm

01:01:41.05 I'm all about efficiency when it comes to achievements

01:01:43.18 who cares about the legitimacy of them you guys are going to talk about

01:01:46.17 legitimacy when I carried you through countless destiny rates where you

01:01:51.01 literally that's a weird point we did stuff we

01:01:54.05 shot guns we uh stayed alive so you could do a minor amount of damage yeah

01:01:59.04 yeah so you could respawn

01:02:02.00 we prevented a wipe by standing in a corner is true

01:02:07.05 no look I'll I'll give all of destiny to you but halo 3 or me baby I will say we

01:02:12.12 did give Gavin an opportunity to truly redeem himself because there was like a

01:02:17.10 week when this conversation happened that he could go into halo 3 and try to

01:02:21.07 get another overkill legitimately and as far as I know he didn't boot it up once

01:02:25.22 I even recommended he try that yeah I just don't have a 360 handy

01:02:30.13 you don't need one it's backwards compatible oh

01:02:33.04 don't need one wait what was the point of getting the 360 then uh I don't know

01:02:37.10 why he did that but he did it and I wasn't going to argue about it but he

01:02:40.23 just decided to and I was like that's right I appreciate his effort I

01:02:44.19 absolutely without a doubt I'll get one I'll do it all right

01:02:49.01 now the servers are down what yeah but I can't get it I could get it in master

01:02:53.18 chief collection I don't know if that's the same how's that not the same

01:02:57.18 I don't know like I'm not it's the same I'm not saying the whole

01:03:00.19 reason it was I was impressed the time is that the lone wolf was five

01:03:04.22 let me clarify my point before you get mad at me further I literally don't know

01:03:09.03 if it's the same like I'm not saying it isn't the same it's very possible it's

01:03:12.14 just like it's I don't know if it's yeah like it's a different engine like I

01:03:16.02 don't know what the yeah I'm not sure about the exact conversion of those

01:03:19.15 things or if it's like a different halo engine is what I'm saying if you get it

01:03:23.19 I'd love to see it next week I want to see an overkill from

01:03:28.02 you and hale on the map next week I'm very good at halo

01:03:31.20 get out you're really you're good at halo we almost you [ __ ] platinum one the

01:03:37.17 race the race we did was very competitive I thought you were gonna win honestly

01:03:43.16 I got lucky I think you say you're platinum one like that doesn't mean

01:03:48.09 something I'm rubble four [Laughter]

01:03:51.01 like platinum one sounds amazing to me glass three yeah that's behind a pay wall

01:03:59.12 oh yeah yeah well I this seems like uh probably a place

01:04:04.13 where we should stop talking now that we did uh we did a pretty good one there I

01:04:09.04 think that was fun oh yeah I liked it did everybody talk about everything they

01:04:12.13 wanted to talk about um I have a thing but it's kind of tied

01:04:16.09 to my email account so I can't actually discuss it but is is is that why you

01:04:21.18 haven't heard back from uh Donovan thank god I'm emailing him on my work

01:04:27.07 email oh okay oh good that would be horrendous if it was on my personal I'd

01:04:30.18 be much more upset about losing that if it was personal I uh I have a couple

01:04:34.17 things that they're pretty well one of them's pretty long so we'll get into it

01:04:38.12 at some other yeah why don't we yeah remind me to talk about the

01:04:41.20 infinity pie that's easy and then sonic branding uh but I will say uh

01:04:46.23 I assume you guys saw the kids eat free unzim day picture that came out recently

01:04:51.01 yeah which is the greatest image I've ever seen in my entire life Gavin are you

01:04:56.15 familiar with this let me find it there so I was trying to

01:05:00.10 look into what zim day is from my understanding every

01:05:04.02 every home game in the 82 season was zim day so I've been meaning to update my

01:05:08.13 calendar to make sure I have every sim day listed so I can appropriately

01:05:12.02 celebrate how many zoom days in it yeah how many home games are there in a

01:05:16.04 baseball season Geoff uh there'd be 82

01:05:19.07 so there's 82 zim days in a year how many baseball games in a season total

01:05:25.15 double 64164 I think yeah oh my god are

01:05:28.15 you serious here let me put yes yeah I'm gonna put this thing play a lot of

01:05:32.02 baseball yeah they play a lot of these imagine having a season ticket

01:05:35.12 I mean it basically starts it starts in April and it ends in uh

01:05:39.11 like at the end of October but you could be committing basically

01:05:44.04 every other day of the year I like that gavin's perspective of of it

01:05:48.12 being difficult is from the fans angle not the athlete

01:05:52.08 not that like having to physically participate in that many games he's like

01:05:56.15 how do you have the time to go watch these things well I mean most of the

01:06:01.20 world are the fans not the players look at that photo Gavin don simmer chicken

01:06:07.07 chicken wing in one hand bowl of chicken wing in the other some

01:06:12.12 popcorn under the elbow kids pointing at something shock

01:06:15.17 all the kids seem shocked by what's happening and zimmers just couldn't be

01:06:19.12 happier giant grin on his face they're looking at different [ __ ]

01:06:24.08 yeah no they're all slightly it's funny to think that those kids are

01:06:29.05 older than us oh my god I wonder if we can find out who they are and what ask

01:06:34.06 what it was like to say that's such a good idea the next mystery to solve

01:06:40.10 I would have been seven so these kids are probably in the 10 to 12 range right

01:06:45.12 so you could have been one of these kids if you were in the right place I was a

01:06:49.04 little young but yeah I guess I could have been if I'd have been a Texas

01:06:52.03 rangers fan back in the day and living in Texas god I want something okay

01:06:56.00 though I just it's disturbing that I can see his chair but the kid

01:07:01.11 to the right of him doesn't have one has a very like they're in heaven vibe

01:07:07.01 which is not what you want to go with they've all died it feels like default

01:07:11.22 this is zimmer in heaven right now eating chicken wings laughing at Gavin

01:07:16.06 breaking his apple ii remote covering himself.

01:07:21.01 [Music]

01:07:22.04 That kid is pointing at the hole that Gavin just created in the bottom can you

01:07:27.20 believe he just broke his bed down too

01:07:33.01 we should make sure they're side by side in the Instagram post

01:07:37.11 I love the idea that somewhere in heaven

01:07:40.04 don zimmer is sitting on white bleachers with a bunch of little kids eating

01:07:44.12 chicken wings and just watching Gavin go through life laughing and pointing at

01:07:49.14 every interesting thing that happens he ordered another
