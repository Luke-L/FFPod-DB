00:00:36.04 Hello and welcome to another episode of the F**kFuckFacePodcast I believe this is

00:00:42.04 number 95 is that correct are you serious is it 96

00:00:46.08 it's a 96. Can you not keep the chat up oh I had it switched over when I hit

00:00:51.16 record I see it now hello and welcome to the episode 96 of the F**kFuckFacePodcast

00:00:57.05 nick says ha ha ha ha ha see I'm looking in the chat now so I get all the

00:01:02.19 important information uh season four year two episode 96. Andrew

00:01:06.23 Gavin go ahead hello I expected you to just open this by

00:01:10.19 yelling [ __ ] glass because you were very you're very passionate about it

00:01:16.05 last episode man yeah I'm [ __ ]

00:01:20.15 what do y'all want to talk about what you guys got going on Andrew what's been

00:01:24.06 happening with you well I mean I want to

00:01:26.01 know about [ __ ] less is what I'd like to

00:01:28.11 know if you're if you're open to talking about I want to go deeper yeah I'll go

00:01:31.12 we'll go into the glass talk if you want I just realized though before you get

00:01:34.23 onto glass we didn't do the thing that we said we were going to do last time

00:01:38.13 god what was damn it we didn't talk about ants in Geoff's bike

00:01:43.05 so let me okay we're gonna go behind the curtain no we're gonna go behind the

00:01:48.06 curtain on this so I listened to it and I took down all the notes I texted

00:01:52.23 beside this ideas cause jack always does the next time on and he

00:01:56.23 bases it on our discord conversation and the photos that we exchange while we

00:02:00.20 record but we hadn't had anything recorded so jack just made up a bunch of

00:02:06.10 stuff so I said it would be funny if we use jack's made up outline

00:02:09.13 as sort of our show that we covered everything jack talked about so this

00:02:13.00 outline would end up being correct I then realized I hadn't spoken to

00:02:17.01 either of you guys in a month and I didn't want to do I just wanted to talk

00:02:20.08 to both so I stepped away from it oh okay well

00:02:23.19 you know what yeah we faced ourselves by not doing it because our friendship is

00:02:27.13 more important and isn't that the spirit of the show anyway and then I

00:02:31.12 thought about bringing it back up again for like four episodes from now because

00:02:36.04 that would also be very funny if we randomly covered all those things okay

00:02:42.01 so I've got to try and smuggle something Geoff needs to start an ant colony in a

00:02:46.05 bike yeah based on the way you're talking before you left I thought a butt

00:02:50.11 plug may be smuggled back and in some way you're asking about medals it seemed

00:02:55.20 like you had something planned Gavin do you own a butt plug no

00:03:00.21 I've never owned it but what instantly was too slow yeah it wasn't instantly

00:03:05.06 I think he's got butt plug planned this is what he has I think he probably rents

00:03:09.22 them so he doesn't have to say he owns them

00:03:12.12 imagine a blockbuster for buttplugs yeah

00:03:14.06 that's just what I was thinking that the late fees on a bump plug would be

00:03:17.18 horrendous butt buster uh what would be like you have to clean be

00:03:22.02 kind clean like what would be the be kind rewind of the butt plug

00:03:25.19 be kind give it a wipe it doesn't quite roll off the tongue but

00:03:29.10 it's like that's there's something there we have something

00:03:36.00 be kind to others behind well that's doesn't help the next renter does it be

00:03:42.03 kind to others behind I mean I guess if you're cleaning the butt plug you are

00:03:46.03 being kind of there behind because they're getting it you know all

00:03:50.10 right you'll give that one to nick gross fluids

00:03:53.01 you know injected into you or vice versa I'm really I don't know maybe I have

00:03:56.18 built up in my head but the way you were

00:03:59.05 talking before Gavin it sounded like you were going to be [ __ ] tony stark in a

00:04:03.05 cave building a butt plug is the the tone I got from you're asking about

00:04:07.11 medals and yeah making the titanium butt plug yeah yeah I'm excited I'm

00:04:11.12 anticipating that being a thing at some point I need to give your mum something

00:04:15.04 for her birthday I don't like that you're tying it to that at all it

00:04:19.07 doesn't need to be a gift she likes the slightest high-end extravagant things

00:04:24.13 that is that is true I can't argue that point

00:04:29.03 and I've gotta we gotta have a gift when we get there oh okay I love where this

00:04:35.05 is going Andrew is not into this this is

00:04:37.10 great no I'm not into this at all that's okay I'll bite that for a minute.

00:04:48.00 I can add to the list Geoff doesn't even know what I've planned for

00:04:54.20 him I gotta think I can't wait to talk about the show Geoff

00:04:59.16 Geoff completely [ __ ] me over and I can't talk about why yet but Geoff

00:05:04.23 without even knowing it got me didn't he cause I'm an idiot

00:05:08.16 he did do it recently I think I mentioned it before I can't talk about

00:05:12.21 it yet because I haven't the whole plan hasn't come through but

00:05:16.12 one at some point I'll be able to talk about a story in which Geoff completely

00:05:19.22 screwed me over without his knowledge and it's very funny but I got plants I'm

00:05:24.05 retaliating not retaliating let me recorrect let me just let me go back on

00:05:28.02 brain I'm I'm gifting I'm re-gifting I'm I'm from

00:05:31.10 I'm gonna enjoy sending you a nice friendship gift to return the delightful

00:05:37.12 favor of you mailing me the bubble wrap okay man

00:05:40.01 I uh you know it was sent with love just trying to remember that and so is mine

00:05:44.07 hey let me ask you a question let me ask you a question yeah since we last spoke

00:05:47.18 have you sprained your ankle I haven't been able to walk since yes no I think

00:05:51.22 I've had two days I've kept spraining it and or dealing with issues did you lay

00:05:55.14 the bubble wrap out everywhere like I instructed I I know I did not [ __ ]

00:05:59.17 listen to me dude you'd be walking around like a pro right now

00:06:03.08 the haircut was a window of time in which I was able to walk without issues

00:06:07.11 so after the haircut you resprayed oh after the haircut I resprained I was

00:06:11.03 trying to get up and I got up at a bad angle and my flick I can't I can't

00:06:16.02 handle this [ __ ] absolutely ridiculous Andrew this is not okay

00:06:20.23 this is life that you've got no this is what I was turned I had my chair to my

00:06:26.23 desk and my feet at the base of my bed and I decided to get up but my feet were

00:06:31.20 in my box spring and so when I stood up it

00:06:35.10 kind of popped a little bit because it came up at a little bit of a strange

00:06:39.18 angle and it was uneven and so I've been dealing with that for the last two days

00:06:46.02 this [ __ ] literally you literally got the solution to all of

00:06:49.22 your problems gift wrapped and mailed to you and you won't use it it's like he

00:06:55.03 thinks it's a joke hey well yeah you know no I think it's a

00:06:58.22 very thoughtful gift that I cannot wait to return the favor with my own thing

00:07:04.05 I can't wait well if it's at all dependent on you walking

00:07:07.18 there I'm not I'm not I'm gonna be completely honest with you here if you

00:07:12.13 wouldn't have canceled mvp2 you'd be getting it today it would happen today

00:07:18.00 you've saved yourself once again accidentally you don't even know what

00:07:22.17 you did but you once when you canceled it I was like [ __ ] okay

00:07:26.17 later do it later all right well that's good it's in the works good to know but

00:07:32.06 let's talk about glass Eric I think it might uh I think uh future schedulings

00:07:36.00 of mvp2 might prove to be very difficult it's not tied to mvp2 you're an idiot

00:07:41.03 it's not tied to that we'll see uh here's I'll talk about glass but first

00:07:46.06 I wanna because we last episode we had a lot of call backs and I was enjoying it

00:07:50.19 we were we were going we went all the way back to episode one with the hair

00:07:54.10 uh we went back a few times do you guys remember I'm gonna tell you

00:07:58.21 a little story about uh one of my adventures since we all last spoke was

00:08:04.01 fridge related do you guys remember about a year ago

00:08:06.12 trying to figure out how I want to tell this do you guys remember about a year

00:08:10.04 ago when I uh I had some fridge problems and I decided to price out a new fridge

00:08:13.09 but the fridge yeah you had applejack come over yeah yeah

00:08:17.11 yeah I remember a broom sort of lent against the door at one point or

00:08:21.16 something yeah yeah yeah uh and uh he was able to kind of uh like uh

00:08:26.19 mickey mouse it back together so that it worked but was like you know it's no

00:08:32.08 good man it's not it's no good and I was like okay and uh

00:08:36.21 and uh I went I got it priced out priced out a new one to fit the peculiar size

00:08:42.13 of my recessed fridge and it was gonna be the price of a jet

00:08:45.07 ski a new jet ski not a used jet ski and

00:08:48.02 then we all laughed about it and then we decided um

00:08:51.00 you know I'll put that off uh because it's the fridge is mostly working uh

00:08:55.08 it's working it's doing like 70 percent of the things it should do so

00:08:59.20 that's that's pretty good right it's better than half uh the Monday

00:09:04.13 of this week I I was looking at it and a piece of it broke off

00:09:10.02 and I thought you know what [ __ ] it I'm sick of like the shelves keep getting

00:09:15.12 lower because they keep breaking and I have less and less so that I have like

00:09:19.11 the top part of my fridge is just getting it's just a lot of open air now

00:09:23.11 you can put really cool things in yeah I can put super super tall stuff in my

00:09:26.14 fridge so I thought [ __ ] it I'm gonna go to those people and I'm gonna say hey

00:09:29.19 let me go ahead and get that fridge cause I know uh the fridge is working

00:09:34.00 but it's you know it's it's on its last legs right so I go uh

00:09:38.00 to the place and I say hey remember me and they're like absolutely not I have

00:09:40.21 no member of you whatsoever it's been a year and I talked to you for three

00:09:44.04 minutes and I was like that's totally fair uh but they were able to find me in

00:09:47.11 their system and uh la I don't know if you remember but

00:09:51.15 last time they told me it would be five to eight weeks to get my fridge mm-hmm

00:09:56.00 and I thought well that's ridiculous well this time I came in and they said

00:09:59.21 well there's gonna be a bit of a the some things have changed since you were

00:10:03.12 last here and I go okay she goes uh there's gonna be a bit of a

00:10:07.10 wait and I go oh yeah she told me last time it could be like two months and she

00:10:11.00 goes well it's running a little longer than two months but that's not the

00:10:14.03 biggest thing uh the biggest thing is it's a little bit more expensive now and

00:10:17.09 I was like oh well how how much has it gone up in price and she goes uh well

00:10:21.16 it's about two thousand dollars more than it was okay

00:10:25.11 all right that's uh that's on me that's like a fridge yeah

00:10:33.20 it's like an 88 it's like a 88 corolla corolla

00:10:39.20 I go okay that's on me but you know what better to get ahead of this now than

00:10:44.23 have it to do it in a year and have it be another thousand or two thousand

00:10:48.16 dollars on top of that you know like I don't think things aren't trending in a

00:10:52.07 good direction and considering like the global supply chain issues and world war

00:10:56.04 three and everything I feel like shit's just gonna continue to get harder and

00:10:59.16 harder to get and more expensive so I was like [ __ ] it I'm getting this fridge

00:11:04.03 so I said you know what fine we'll do it and uh and I said so it's like two

00:11:07.15 months and she goes oh yeah right no sorry I didn't get to finish that uh

00:11:10.17 it's uh let me see let me put it in it is you know essentially march the first

00:11:15.09 week of march uh or second week of march uh you can have it next march

00:11:20.23 can I say excuse me and she goes yeah there's about a year

00:11:25.00 it's about a year now to get it in huh Jesus

00:11:29.14 just in case uh just in case and I went are you [ __ ] serious and she was like

00:11:34.13 oh yeah she she was like nice about it she was

00:11:37.01 like I welcome you to go and try to find a fridge anywhere else on earth right

00:11:42.10 now faster and I'm like yeah I get it I can get you a fridge and

00:11:45.16 not that fits the size and uh and then I go she goes oh well also this is last

00:11:50.12 year's fridge did you want to I mean you could do this year's fridge and I went

00:11:54.04 oh well that's a good point if it's like you have a new model

00:11:57.12 what's the lead time on a new bottle and she goes let me check

00:12:00.19 uh oh it's about a year and a half so if

00:12:01.16 you want to I was like no no no no we're going last year's fridge let's just

00:12:05.01 fridge please please please please please uh so anyway a face to myself hard

00:12:10.20 to the tune of uh when it's all said and done two years to get a fridge that I

00:12:15.00 should have bought and two thousand dollars more so my stupidity cost me a

00:12:19.01 grand and a grand a year for two years so does that mean there weren't are they

00:12:23.03 still going to have like a next year's fridge if the lead time is over a year

00:12:26.05 on a fridge I don't [ __ ] know they might as well

00:12:29.11 just skip a year they might as well just stop making fridges yeah

00:12:34.13 that'll fix the problem less fridges when you order

00:12:37.17 when you order the fridge are you fully paid for at this point are you locked in

00:12:42.12 oh I fully paid for it I have I have I sent off the money uh and in one year

00:12:46.20 it's gonna fly back to me as a refrigerator are you but are you like

00:12:50.09 you cannot get out of this fridge now you are now stuck with this fridge you

00:12:54.06 cannot get a refund for the money you put in there's no uh

00:12:57.16 I mean I don't know I don't intend on uh putting myself to the back of the line

00:13:01.22 again so I'll take this fridge with me wherever I go like this fridge and I are

00:13:07.18 bonded for life I like the idea of just constantly

00:13:10.22 making sure you're always in the queue but not necessarily needing like being

00:13:15.02 in yeah I'm four months into my fridge I got a dryer six months I don't need it

00:13:18.19 right now but I can pull out whatever I need to

00:13:21.06 I'm just constantly in the queue I don't

00:13:23.03 want to be stuck in the back of the line I think now's the time just to get in

00:13:26.19 all the lines like yeah no matter what you need I'm going to stop by a shower

00:13:30.10 you know if everybody was smart they would

00:13:33.22 liquidate their savings account and they

00:13:36.15 would go in and they would put orders on commercial fridges and then

00:13:40.11 in a year when they get that fridge in put it up on eBay like a tickle me elmo

00:13:44.13 and sell it for ten thousand dollars more than you paid for it

00:13:49.03 imagining like wolf of wall street sell me this yes this pen but it's like sell

00:13:52.17 me this fridge sell me this 10000

00:13:55.05 massive fridge what's the word for when

00:13:57.22 you buy a bunch of [ __ ] and sell it way more expensive in times of peril

00:14:02.19 what'd you say it's like when people buy all the bog roll and then they start

00:14:06.16 flogging it for like four times the price to people oh price gouging

00:14:10.06 profiteering that was it that's profiteering yeah

00:14:13.15 you're gonna be fridge profiteering so do you have a fridge that works

00:14:18.07 currently I mean I have the fridge that that most of it works yeah

00:14:21.19 I mean it still doesn't do the things that it didn't used to do uh like one of

00:14:26.04 the one of the shelves on the side broke off so I just have a one less row again

00:14:31.04 I'm I'm I'm down to about 70 of my rows and then of course the lights and then

00:14:35.02 of course the the rusty ice and the water not working so if the next time I

00:14:40.02 was at your house I just broke your fridge as a joke that'd be

00:14:43.19 you you'd be absolutely screwed that'd be quite a joke quite a joke you know

00:14:48.12 lucky for Geoff he's friends with somebody who fills the need whenever

00:14:53.14 this has happened there is a plumbing issue in the past and uh

00:14:57.14 I came in and I saved the day and it sounds to me this is another scenario

00:15:02.23 where you might need a fridge you need a fridge

00:15:05.07 of some kind of thing that that cools items I guess is what we could say I

00:15:10.00 think I could do this I think I could get a fridge for you

00:15:12.15 I'm just saying I think my uh my fridge laundromat idea is making more sense

00:15:16.19 than ever I think people are really gonna start to leave that process

00:15:20.02 dude if William perry shows up at my house knocks on my front door and says I'm

00:15:25.04 here to keep your [ __ ] cool bro I'll I'll [ __ ] I'll be indebted to you for

00:15:30.06 life that would be awesome William perry with like a cooler over himself like

00:15:34.22 it's like suspenders but it's a cooler

00:15:37.16 Gavin you don't know who William perry is because you're British but he was a

00:15:42.08 Chicago bear football player who his nickname was William the refrigerator

00:15:46.17 perry because he was as big as a and she kind of shaped like a fridge and he

00:15:50.16 famously scored a touchdown in the in the super bowl and then became an

00:15:55.14 amateur boxer for a while that's a great nickname for a boxer was

00:15:59.02 he still the refrigerator as well once you're the refrigerator you are

00:16:03.12 always the refrigerator nothing I think the best sports nickname I ever heard

00:16:08.09 and I want to say he was the last person he was either the first he's in one of

00:16:14.02 the first nfl drafts his name was bob train and his nickname was chuchu so

00:16:17.23 he's listed as bob choo choo train that's a lot cooler than a fridge

00:16:22.15 related nickname dude I heard a [ __ ] nickname the other day uh

00:16:27.22 it was so [ __ ] funny who we who was it

00:16:31.16 [ __ ] I'd be I'd be Gavin freon by the way if I was going fridge-themed oh

00:16:38.10 uh on the uh we were in the pleasantries we were talking about the clippers and

00:16:43.20 the Lakers and the different trajectories of their seasons uh Eric

00:16:47.04 was uh there's a player on the uh on the los Angeles clippers his name is

00:16:51.19 Reggie Jackson and they've his new nickname that everybody's calling him is

00:16:56.12 stimulus check because he keeps bailing the team out [Laughter]

00:17:00.13 I was watching the game the other day and they kept calling him stimulus check

00:17:04.15 and I thought that was the funniest [ __ ] thing

00:17:07.21 you gotta love a current nickname yeah oh and they are they call him big

00:17:12.08 government right big government's good I think my favorite like nickname for any

00:17:21.07 Julian the Cuban missile crisis Marquez it's just so long it's pretty long

00:17:28.04 but glass I still don't know about glass we're talking about your fridge

00:18:53.22 dog walks by and hits a [ __ ] coffee table glass falls off and shatters the

00:18:57.13 next thing you know you got glass in your feet for the next month while

00:19:01.01 you're trying to [ __ ] find it all it's just it's stupid it's [ __ ]

00:19:05.03 Stupid and I got to thinking why don't we I I need to replace every glass in my

00:19:09.07 house with solid cups just like [ __ ]

00:19:11.22 heart like sturdy not gonna shatter badass cups so that got me thinking

00:19:17.18 what's the best cup like there's a lot of different I was talking to Eric about

00:19:22.13 a little bit and then I got talking to Andrew about it and like

00:19:26.15 I've on the I'm on the I'm on the search for the perfect cup right

00:19:31.12 nobody will know you drank it's [Laughter]

00:19:37.01 perfect genius except except your first [ __ ] drink you're

00:19:40.21 gonna put it to your lips and you're gonna be like ralphie in a Christmas store

00:19:46.06 your mouth's gonna be frozen to your [ __ ]

00:19:49.01 oh yeah

00:19:51.14 so I started doing research and I wanted to find the is this a uniform thing I I

00:19:57.01 think it could okay so I started just I started polling people and asking what

00:20:00.09 people's favorite cup is and my girlfriend actually I think

00:20:03.16 landed on uh the perfect cup which I totally agree with uh but I was I asked

00:20:07.19 I asked you to I asked everybody ahead of time you know be thinking about it

00:20:12.04 and let me know uh so if everybody could just post what their favorite cup is

00:20:15.19 well I think we can get somewhere my favorite cup like a photo like the

00:20:20.18 best you could draw I need to do a blueprint of my favorite my favorite cup

00:20:25.06 I don't think the best cup exists yet yeah when I mentioned it to you you told

00:20:28.15 me you were going to design a cup like homer Simpson designed a car which is

00:20:32.19 scary well it's because it's like if we're

00:20:35.12 perfecting cup technology we need to go some places with it

00:20:39.07 I will say it's very adamant about the fact that it needs to hold a liter of

00:20:42.21 water yeah like a minimum your one wreck was

00:20:45.17 uh prerequisite it must hold a liter of water it needs a liter water because

00:20:50.13 they always say like drink eight cups of water a day

00:20:54.02 if you have a liter cup that's four you just need four cups of water we're

00:20:57.11 reducing the amount of refills you need it's just a superior product like just

00:21:02.23 the math on it it's better can't argue it's not more efficient it's a great cup

00:21:08.02 what uh Eric you said uh like a rudy's cup which I agree I got one from this

00:21:11.14 place called from this Mexican restaurant by my house I think I

00:21:14.19 sent you a photo let's see if I put that up that's a pretty good [ __ ] cup stop

00:21:19.14 I think it's good I think rudy's does a classic like a classic cup right it's

00:21:25.12 like this is the cup that you have a million of all through college or whatever

00:21:30.10 they they last forever and then your wife says we don't need these cups

00:21:33.20 anymore and you go you're right we don't need these cups anymore this is the one

00:21:38.01 I got that kind of set the thinking off uh so it's like it's like the rudy's cup

00:21:42.04 maybe a little bigger just based on my thumb compared to your thumb against the

00:21:46.01 cup uh and I like this cup because it's huge it's big uh but it's still uh and

00:21:50.09 it's it's a little flexible but I don't know that I want flexible in my cup

00:21:53.22 because it because what if you grab it emphatically you're gonna you're gonna

00:21:57.02 spill right and I'm an emphatic person I like to grab things emphatically from

00:22:00.19 time to time so uh a lot of people are recommending uh

00:22:05.05 like metal cups which I think is just ludicrous I think it's a horrible idea

00:22:10.08 because what do you like about that well I'll tell you what a titanium cup crack

00:22:14.02 it crack a tooth on that plastic cup you can't do it

00:22:17.08 emphatically put a metal cup up to your mouth not paying attention or you move a

00:22:21.05 fraction of an inch the wrong way you're going to bash your own goddamn teeth in

00:22:26.06 it's it's I'd rather hit my teeth on metal than glass why not plastic I'm

00:22:31.20 recommending plastic I agree that's another reason glass sucks what

00:22:36.07 if you bash your tooth with the edge of a glass and then it shatters the glass

00:22:39.17 and your tooth and then you end up eating a bunch of glass glass [ __ ]

00:22:44.08 sucks why are we putting it near our mouths

00:22:46.12 you know I think historically there's been never been a better time to embrace

00:22:51.16 and make more things out of plastic that's the exact direction that everyone

00:22:56.02 is going in plastic's perfect it makes it taste like plastic

00:23:00.02 no way what's the uh thing that you you know I'm gonna eat caviar with because

00:23:04.19 the metal spoon like taints the taste they use like uh

00:23:07.15 what's that [ __ ] like mother of pearl or something maybe that's the

00:23:12.00 the material for a cup here's what I think the perfect cup is boom

00:23:16.06 that looks like a the pizza hut cup have you ever had

00:23:21.14 a soda a diet coke or a regular coke or dr pepper with ice in that thing and not

00:23:27.12 loved every second of it those cups we perfected cups in the 1970s and I don't

00:23:34.02 know when we got away from them

00:23:37.03 it's because we're still because the places you're going are still using the

00:23:41.14 ones from the 70s because they're still around because they last forever and

00:23:45.14 that's getting used by hundreds of people a day you put those puppies in

00:23:49.14 your house Gavin you would never even come close to seeing the half-life of

00:23:54.13 that cup it'll look you'll be buried with it someday looking brand new

00:23:58.22 nick agrees it rules that cup full of ice is awesome so I was talking to

00:24:02.12 Andrew about it and I was telling them we need to invent the perfect cup and

00:24:07.18 that's my starting point that material that that

00:24:10.12 density that weight it's got a heft to it at the bottom it's it's solid it's

00:24:14.21 not malleable it's not going to bash anybody's teeth in it keeps stuff

00:24:18.11 incredibly cool it doesn't taste like plastic at all it tastes like a pizza

00:24:22.19 hut in 1975 which is where everybody wants to be and if you don't there's

00:24:27.03 something [ __ ] wrong with you and it's fun so we start there

00:24:35.14 when Geoff first brought this up to me I've no I felt like I was being [ __ ]

00:24:41.03 with the entire time it's one of the weirdest text chains I think I've ever

00:24:44.18 had with you I don't know if it was by design

00:24:48.08 or if you're just living your life Geoff texted me at 1021 am on Sunday

00:24:53.14 what's the perfect cup and then I replied with this I think

00:24:57.14 this is the perfect cup technically a mug

00:24:59.11 but I think it's the perfect cup that's immediately what I thought of what I

00:25:04.00 thought oh the inverse handle it's the inverse ubisoft handle misprint I don't

00:25:10.00 hear from Geoff until 745 pm and he replies huh I'd have to disagree

00:25:14.12 and then he said I got a really good cup

00:25:17.04 today and he sent me a photo of the zuzu cup

00:25:20.14 and I replied what's so good about that cup he said lots I ask such as

00:25:25.11 Geoff replies by sending me a 30 second video of him watching a real housewives

00:25:30.13 reunion show explaining why I should be watching it oh that had nothing to do

00:25:36.03 with the cup that was an aside a total yeah but it's in the middle I asked such

00:25:40.06 as and then you were playing with the 30

00:25:42.07 seconds oh yeah I can see how that would be confusing for you yeah no disregard

00:25:47.03 that I do think you should be watching the housewives

00:25:50.17 I yeah I'm not a po but then he replied the outfits alone it's a reunion show so

00:25:54.14 the outfits are insane so then I ask what happened to the cup and Geoff said

00:25:59.00 huh oh just think about your favorite cup I guess I'm thinking we could get

00:26:02.20 into the cup business it's like what are

00:26:04.20 you talking about we're talking you just sent me a cup you asked me what my

00:26:08.07 perfect cup is you sent me what feels just like a standard cup and then you're

00:26:12.18 pivoting and that's ridiculous it was insane well I got a lot going on in my

00:26:18.12 head man you did I'm I'm multi-threaded uh so the whole story about hate and

00:26:23.10 glass was that you just don't like drinking out like nothing happened you

00:26:26.16 just don't like drinking out of a glass well the cup no I don't I I had a yeah I

00:26:31.06 had like one of my glasses broke when I was pulling out the dishwasher and it

00:26:35.01 sliced my finger open and then later that day that was like on

00:26:39.12 Saturday or Sunday morning because I had I got that cup Sunday morning uh it was

00:26:43.18 like that morning I was at a I was at uh the store or the zuzu place and I

00:26:48.03 thought it was a pretty good cup and then I thought why the [ __ ] am I cutting

00:26:51.22 my fingers on glass like an [ __ ]

00:26:53.22 every day when I could just have a I'm gonna take this cup home with me I paid

00:26:57.07 like it was like 99 cents extra and it's like [ __ ] this is gonna do this is so

00:27:01.14 much cheaper and better and safer than a glass why am I wasting time with glass

00:27:05.08 and then it set me on this whole path and Andrew and I got to thinking about it

00:27:09.17 I don't know what the perfect because we're going to invent the perfect cup

00:27:13.05 right yeah I think that my idea is that the pizza hut cup is a starting point

00:27:17.13 for it uh because there's a lot going on that's right with it and then

00:27:22.19 want to talk about throwbacks dude that burp tasted so bad [Laughter]

00:27:28.02 I just grossed myself out uh yeah I agree it was disgusting nick you

00:27:33.22 should have been in my mouth it's way worse here

00:27:37.20 I was we were talking about it should be

00:27:40.19 we can't do it red because that's iconic

00:27:43.05 that we should make it gurple because we already invented our own color why not

00:27:47.11 put stuff in gurple and then I had the idea we could call it because Andrew

00:27:50.13 wants it to be big we could call it the big gurp instead of the big gulp and

00:27:54.09 then Andrew I think improved upon that and he said we should call it Andrew the

00:27:59.12 gurpler I don't think there's anything better on earth than the gurpler

00:28:06.08 so so we're going to make it sell a gurpla I think we should make it sell a

00:28:11.15 gurpler but I think we we're still in the like

00:28:15.13 we have the name down you have the color

00:28:17.19 figured out I think sort of like when we

00:28:20.00 did the wrist pockets we should all come up with our own like sketch of what

00:28:25.18 would be the perfect cup and then next episode we could share this I think

00:28:30.13 notes because I have some ideas in my head I

00:28:32.23 think there's some some innovation that the cup game has been lacking

00:28:36.13 I don't think there's been really any innovation that I can think of

00:28:40.23 uh in a long time I would agree with anything

00:28:43.16 the most recent innovation I've seen is putting the handle inside the coffee cup

00:28:47.09 and I don't think that that's working out

00:28:50.17 that's just great is what it is there's no way effective but

00:28:54.08 I'm into this idea yeah so everybody uh we've got we've got most of it figured

00:28:59.05 out we've got we've got that it's a cup we know that

00:29:03.03 we know that it's uh it's gurple we know that it's called the gurpler and it has

00:29:07.04 to hold at least how much water Andrew I

00:29:09.09 think a liter I think it needs something I think we have more figured out than

00:29:14.19 most kick starters do when they start totally just have a name and a color

00:29:19.14 totally agree we're on the right path so uh anyway that's why I say [ __ ] glass

00:29:25.12 I'm gonna I'm gonna eliminate my goal is to eliminate glass from houses all

00:29:29.17 across the world and to save people the annoying little bits of glass that end

00:29:34.05 up getting stuck in the bottom of their foot when they go to the fridge at

00:29:37.03 midnight and they realize they didn't clean up that spot or when you go in and

00:29:41.19 then you slice the inside of your [ __ ] hand open trying to pull out a

00:29:46.02 tumbler or a glass out of your out of your dishwasher because it's shattered

00:29:49.11 because it's stupid or when your dog walks by and hits a the end of a table

00:29:54.10 and it knocks a glass over and then it shatters because it's stupid I'm trying

00:30:00.20 to fix the world with the gurpler.

00:33:17.02 I spelled it right did I show you my uh issue with the

00:33:21.05 issue I had with glass a few months ago no I don't think so no I might have sent

00:33:27.05 this to you like privately maybe it was when my

00:33:29.18 cat was oh yeah my back and we were out the window and then my cat started to

00:33:34.00 jump to it little cat treat it kicked my

00:33:47.18 the footage is great because you just hit like a gun

00:33:56.23 oh my god that was the last time my cat sat on my

00:34:02.02 shoulders as we both looked out the window

00:34:07.07 it's such a majestic pose by your cat too like it's really you can tell

00:34:12.07 there's some force in that jump it's like a 14 pound cat too he's got some fire

00:34:19.12 do you have any idea what it was jumping to like that seems like yeah it was

00:34:24.19 that's like a little cat tree behind me okay he was just done being up there it

00:34:28.15 looks like the type of dive it looks like an action movie like going for the

00:34:33.12 gun or whatever the the final fight or whatever like needing to get there first

00:34:37.03 there's determination in that leap have you met someone

00:34:41.03 you know you you like meet different people throughout life people have

00:34:44.18 different names you meet some people who have the same name have you met anyone

00:34:48.21 who you didn't like and then met someone with the same name that you didn't like

00:34:53.03 either like to the point where it's like you're predisposed to

00:34:57.12 sort of be on on guard against people who have that name whenever you meet

00:35:02.10 them sure yeah there's yeah I got one throw out a name Hayden

00:35:09.01 Hayden I met one shitty Hayden when I was in fifth grade and I've got a

00:35:13.16 reluctance towards Hayden's but just the one you're basically off one bad Hayden

00:35:18.08 I'm basing it off of one bad Hayden I've never encountered another one but that

00:35:23.05 initial meeting that person would have to overcome the baggage of the last

00:35:28.06 Aiden without you I'm working against two bad lucases

00:35:33.01 does it spell the name of the c or is it a k like a Lucas with a k like

00:35:37.22 c every time so if you're a regulation listener who's called Lucas um uh you

00:35:43.07 know nothing personal I'm sure you're great but just I've had a couple of bad

00:35:49.02 Lucas experiences now can it be first and or last name any

00:35:53.07 Lucas involved at all that's a warning sign for you at this point or is it only

00:35:58.19 if their first name is Lucas spelled with a c

00:36:01.03 say that again like let's say George Lucas oh does that I think is that is

00:36:05.01 that a barrier for you does it have to be a first name is it I think it has to

00:36:09.12 be a first name okay and it has to be Lucas spelt specifically I-u-c-a-s I'm

00:36:13.13 not sure the spelling is as important okay it's the same I think

00:36:16.23 coincidentally they were both with a c oh nick says

00:36:21.11 he says now you mentioned it every Lucas I've met was kind of a turd

00:36:26.10 it can't actually be a Lucas thing there's no way I I'm determined to meet

00:36:31.16 a nice Lucas.

00:36:36.02 I don't know that I've ever liked an Edward that I've met really

00:36:40.12 that's quite a common name yeah Edward huh I've met some good ads oh

00:36:49.07 yeah I'm thinking of people that that describe themselves as an Edward and

00:36:53.03 want to be referred to as Edward because obviously we have a friend named ed

00:36:57.09 who's quite lovely yeah huh so Hayden Lucas and Edward

00:37:02.21 what a trio those are the these are the three people we do not I can actually

00:37:08.01 see those three hanging out by name alone like if you told me there was a

00:37:11.16 group with Lucas Hayden and Edward that checks out

00:37:14.20 I hope to god if it doesn't already exist a Lucas Hayden and Edward start a

00:37:20.12 podcast if you're a regulation face listener or a comment leaver or a

00:37:25.14 regulation listener who's looking to promote yourself to a comment leaver

00:37:29.01 although I would argue it's not a promotion lateral at best uh and you're

00:37:33.08 looking to start a podcast and you have one of those names put yourself out

00:37:36.07 there maybe you'll maybe you guys can all hook up and create the anti-face

00:37:39.19 podcast I bet you could get the guy who directed the tuxedo to come on your show

00:37:45.11 did I ever tell you about the time where I was on a film set and me and another

00:37:50.11 guy both thought we had the same name but it was neither of our names

00:37:57.09 what do you mean well I I was like unpacking phantom stuff

00:38:02.10 like I kind of wasn't paying attention I

00:38:05.12 assume this it was like the uh the first ad so he's like the guy just telling

00:38:09.13 everyone what to do basically and he must have been going down the line and

00:38:14.16 meeting people and I didn't I guess I didn't know he was doing that so he must

00:38:18.09 have said something like oh hey I'm jim uh you are and someone would be like oh

00:38:23.02 Steve you'd be like Steve uh roger okay roger nice to meet you so he was

00:38:27.14 repeating back everyone everyone's name back to them but I

00:38:31.06 wasn't paying attention to that bit I was just like rummaging around with

00:38:34.10 stuff so he got to me and uh I went Gavin and he goes Darren and I

00:38:40.13 so I thought his name was Darren and he thought my name was Darren but neither

00:38:46.11 of us were called Darren he was jim or something and I was coming so all day

00:38:52.12 he kept being like Darren and no one would answer and if I needed him I'd be

00:38:57.05 like oh sorry Darren I'm just talking to this person in the

00:39:01.15 middle who didn't exist just because of one

00:39:05.03 tiny moment of confusion in the morning it led to so it was about 4 p.m by the

00:39:10.10 time where I was like I'm Gavin by the way he's like oh but it was like

00:39:16.13 eight hours of confusion and as soon as Darren vanished everything became clear

00:39:21.21 again [Laughter]

00:39:23.20 typical Darren behavior

00:39:29.01 that's impressive I remember I had um it was a family it was like an extended

00:39:34.16 family dinner and there are people there that I didn't know

00:39:39.07 part of the same family and one of them their name was Bryce but I heard it as

00:39:44.13 rice I called it rice the entire evening wasn't the tip

00:39:47.16 it's not a name I'm not going to question it I heard rice I just called

00:39:52.15 him rice the entire time that's probably like I don't know 12

00:39:56.02 13. Did he did he call you out on calling him rice no it never came at

00:40:00.21 once it's like oh my god I've called him rice all day his name's Bryce

00:40:05.15 I don't think I ever saw him again I think that was the only time I ever

00:40:09.17 encountered the prize now [Laughter]

00:40:13.05 so your issues with Lucas are these like serious issues or just like annoyances

00:40:17.08 like I just don't I don't like this guy um no I was like sort of bullied by a

00:40:22.01 bloke called Lucas as a kid and then I just met another bad Lucas and I said

00:40:27.09 man I'm just having bad lucus look bad Lucas like

00:40:31.12 yeah like nothing serious just like ugh my conflict with Bryce was I bought into

00:40:36.15 the peter molyneux hype train it was my my Bryce conflict where it was

00:40:40.06 grade five grade five or grade four I think it was grade five and I'd been

00:40:44.19 playing fable and I was like um love and fable this

00:40:47.18 game is so great and I was talking about things that peter molyneux said were in

00:40:52.12 the game but weren't actually in the game and he bought fable based off of my

00:40:57.11 recommendation based off of what peter molyneux said and they weren't

00:41:02.12 the things I said were not in the game and he was not happy about that he never

00:41:06.08 let it go no he was pissed at me and he never let it go the entire year we only

00:41:10.08 had one year together in the same class and he was mad at me for the whole year

00:41:14.12 because fable didn't feature the thing that I was talking about

00:41:17.16 but I thought it did I didn't know peter molyneux was

00:41:20.15 inaccurate about the mechanic in the game like

00:41:23.05 and of all people too like peter mall knew so famous for over hyping I wonder

00:41:27.13 if how you could have made it up to her you could have given him the money back

00:41:30.21 for the game I could have but um it's grade five I don't have any money

00:41:35.07 and the fact to hold on to it it's wild I was gonna make a joke about uh

00:41:40.02 like hey Lucas haas if you're listening

00:41:42.01 go [ __ ] yourself kind of thing and then

00:41:44.06 I thought I should look up somebody more famous than Lucas haas

00:41:46.21 like with a little bit more name recognition so I looked up most famous.

00:41:50.19 Lucas's guess what there aren't any ah so if your name's Lucas you've got

00:41:56.10 some you can take the stage pretty much yeah

00:42:00.08 it's wide open I mean like there was Lucas hartong the 1963 dutch politician

00:42:05.07 uh uh the Canadian American actor Lucas Bryant who um not familiar oh there you

00:42:11.00 go Lucas cronic the elder he was a German painter in the 1400s that's about

00:42:16.12 it only actor I can think of is josh Lucas but that doesn't even meet the

00:42:20.17 criteria yeah yeah even in sports I don't know any of these lucas's

00:42:24.23 a lot of Brazilian football players in the 50s what about a Luca

00:42:28.14 would you be hesitant about Luca Gavin if you encountered Luka doncic would you

00:42:32.05 be like it's close to Lucas we're getting there we're halfway I'd be fine

00:42:36.12 with Luca okay Luka modric big fan I don't know who that is

00:42:41.17 football who's Luca Madrid okay huh I don't do you have any name beefs

00:42:47.05 outside Edward you have Edward who me yeah you have Edward does that I have one

00:42:51.16 I have one more but I don't want to say it because it that's fair that might be

00:42:57.02 uh might be on this call [Laughter]

00:42:59.22 really anyway let's move on there's somebody on this call what else

00:43:04.15 you guys want no I think that's like we don't need to get into it but whoever

00:43:09.03 that person is I think they deserve credit because they overcame the barrier

00:43:14.15 they are the success story hey I didn't say anybody overcame any barrier

00:43:19.22 no I think don't don't look for success where it

00:43:23.20 doesn't exist buddy okay well let me ask you this

00:43:26.06 what if it happened to me me would a new fridge get me over that beer

00:43:31.01 only if it's delivered by 59 year old William perry

00:43:36.12 Eric and nick do you have any name beef I was gonna let nick go first I don't

00:43:40.21 think I don't think I do uh but similar to how you had a guy who

00:43:45.07 thought your name was Darren I had a boss who thought my name was merrick

00:43:50.19 for like three months so that was merrick yeah he called me merrick and

00:43:58.17 then I don't know like wrote emails to merrick

00:44:05.20 doesn't make any sense no I think when I introduced myself

00:44:10.13 I said I'm Eric but I think I probably just said I'm Eric and then he just yeah

00:44:18.02 I merit and then uh I didn't correct him because

00:44:22.21 I didn't understand like I didn't hear him say it wrong yeah and then it was

00:44:26.16 like three months of him saying it and it got to a point where like I couldn't

00:44:31.18 correct it but and then he found out and he just went why didn't you tell me I'm

00:44:36.00 calling you merrick and I went I don't know I'm sorry so uh so I don't really

00:44:41.03 have named I was just merrick for a while we should make a poster someday with

00:44:47.05 Lucas and merrick and whatever.

00:44:51.18 Dylan or something what was your fake Darren Darren

00:44:55.21 yeah I don't know how he got Darren out of Gavin I don't think I can't have I

00:45:00.21 don't know how I mumbled Gavin into Darren was he also British

00:45:04.19 yeah oh anything weirder huh I wonder if you have a shitty voice

00:45:10.04 you always will have you're just a British accent

00:45:14.02 right yeah that's all like you're all I hear when I when I talk to you is

00:45:17.04 British accent I have no that I have no way to judge the quality of your accent

00:45:20.20 but I wonder if I was English if I'd be like I hate that guy's [ __ ] voice he

00:45:25.03 sounds he's like whatever and I don't know

00:45:27.14 compared to other British people I don't know all British people sound the same

00:45:30.18 to me I feel like unless it's atrocious I have a very hard time in determining

00:45:35.14 if an actor is bad if they're speaking in a different language same

00:45:39.02 if they're a mid-tier actor they seem great to me if I can't understand if

00:45:43.09 it's a different it's a language barrier it's like

00:45:46.15 like dick van dyke in uh Mary poppins sounded fine sounds just like Gavin

00:45:53.03 is that the most famous bad British accent of all time

00:45:57.11 yeah but it's like beyond it's beyond that

00:46:01.00 what about like legendary it's yeah it's like an accent that you want to try and

00:46:05.03 do because it's so bad what was brad pitt trying to do in

00:46:08.00 snatch because his accent was so bad they just changed the character uh I

00:46:11.19 think I think they wanted him to do Irish at first was it Irish was that

00:46:15.11 like that was the thing where like he was just trying to do a normal impression

00:46:20.23 and it was so horrendous that they had to like implement his shitty accent

00:46:26.06 into the character that he played um trying to think of other

00:46:30.10 you know it was a bad one this is I think the most wrong I've ever been

00:46:35.12 about any any piece of content ever I watch squid game maybe like one or two

00:46:40.20 days after it came on the Netflix probably like five days before squid

00:46:45.07 game was a big thing and I hated it I just didn't think it was good and I

00:46:49.05 thought the acting was so bad I talked to like four or five different

00:46:52.12 people I was like hey you hear about this thing I watched it yeah I would not

00:46:56.00 recommend it didn't enjoy it and then it became the biggest show like ever

00:47:00.03 everybody loves it I was such an outlier on that that is the one where even

00:47:04.08 through the accent I thought the acting was not great but I'm I'm apparently in

00:47:08.14 a huge minority on that opinion are you talking about

00:47:11.13 the main characters are you talking about the Americans at the end

00:47:15.08 the main well all of it all the Americans are atrocious too but even the

00:47:19.05 main character the main guy is like I just it's like I feel like he's super

00:47:23.20 overacting I just didn't buy his performance

00:47:25.23 and it was very funny for me to tell like multiple people like yeah not great

00:47:29.19 I wouldn't recommend watching it and then seeing it become like the most

00:47:34.06 universally loved phrased show I was just so off is that your worst

00:47:40.06 context I think it's the most wrong I think I've ever been about anything in

00:47:45.03 my life is is recommending people do not watch squid game because they just

00:47:48.04 didn't think it was great I don't know you like the matrix just saying

00:47:52.07 I did you know what else is great is the batman that's a great movie too it's a

00:47:57.09 fun one I watched that last night yeah what do you think of it well um

00:48:01.17 yeah close your eyes Geoff but uh I liked it I think it's great everybody loves

00:48:06.10 batman he's a great character great movie everyone loves back I've been

00:48:09.18 reading batman comics since I was about five years old batman's super cool love

00:48:13.01 batman love Bruce Wayne gotta I got hundreds of the comics uh a big fan of a

00:48:16.08 big fan of the franchise fantastic movie it's it's maybe the best

00:48:19.11 batman I mean there's a lot a lot of great batman's out there a lot a lot

00:48:22.17 there's a lot of great batman's there's very few bad even you know what even the

00:48:26.16 bad batman is there's something good to say about the batman's sure like I feel

00:48:30.12 like batman and robin famously bad batman movie George Clooney pretty good

00:48:34.19 Bruce Wayne there's a little great blues

00:48:36.12 you can take from that great Bruce great Bruce Wayne yeah absolutely fantastic

00:48:39.13 Bruce wine yeah a lot of a lot of good a lot of good things to be said about

00:48:44.17 batman as a character the franchise uh the comics the the games

00:48:48.19 great batman games maybe we should get out of the requirement that um

00:48:53.09 batman has to be the same actor as Bruce Wayne

00:48:56.15 that's what I was thinking I had that thought the other day what if

00:49:01.06 Robert pattinson took off the the mask and it was just George Clooney

00:49:04.14 underneath I could do it would that be jarring you know who I feel like would

00:49:08.01 be really good Bruce Wayne maybe even a batman john hamm I could see jon hamm

00:49:13.18 it's like a good Bruce Wayne oh he's got that jawline he's got it he's got a

00:49:18.23 batman jawline looks good in the castle [Laughter]

00:49:23.14 he's got a castle vibes there are some people who just have like the face for a

00:49:28.05 mansion like if I stand in the middle of a mansion I'm clearly like visiting a

00:49:33.11 rich friend I'm clearly not supposed to be there yeah just because of my face

00:49:38.21 but john hamm I'd buy that oh man um he is the celebrity spokesperson for a

00:49:45.07 Canadian food delivery service called skip the dishes so I see john ham quite

00:49:50.08 a bit on tv it's always funny when celebrities have like local or like

00:49:54.06 country specific advertising deals I know it's that you know who you see a

00:49:58.00 lot of in england Kevin bacon really yeah what's he doing all over

00:50:02.15 he's all over tv just doing ads or is he like doing a spokesperson for

00:50:07.09 like a specific company it might be a specific thing I just kept I kept like

00:50:11.07 walking past my uh mum's living room and just seeing him on two I was I don't

00:50:14.13 think I saw what he was advertising anyone who's in the uk could let us know

00:50:18.21 in the comments though from a listener to a comment leaver then

00:50:22.04 feel free it's like that trip we took to england uh I mean we've been to england

00:50:25.19 together a few times but the the big one where we went on like the two-week

00:50:29.05 vacation and we drove up to Scotland and

00:50:31.09 all yeah uh that was I don't know around 2010 maybe uh

00:50:34.21 I felt like the entire country of england was only Iggy pop and run dmc

00:50:39.22 and I was like what [ __ ] year is it like it's like

00:50:44.12 2010 what the hell is going on it's Iggy pop run dmc Iggy pop run dmc everywhere

00:50:49.20 you look I'm assuming it's not the case anymore

00:50:52.21 but that was a weird weird point in time do you think the reverse of that is

00:50:56.11 somebody being like all they [ __ ] do is have Shaq on tv he's selling me

00:50:59.22 everything they sell me cars lotion like he is Shaq I feel like is the American

00:51:04.06 equivalent sell me insurance yeah yeah he's in every ad

00:51:07.20 Tommy lee Jones is that for japan timeling Jones has so many great

00:51:11.10 Japanese commercials oh really you haven't seen a Tommy lee Jones

00:51:16.04 Japanese commercial they're [ __ ] wild they're coffee

00:51:19.13 commercials I think if somebody maybe I'll try to pull it up I'll post in the

00:51:23.11 chat there is like compilations online it's like Tommy lee Jones drinking a

00:51:27.17 coffee and then turning into an eagle it's just like what he's been doing oh

00:51:31.14 man they're insane that's a you know what that reminds me I

00:51:35.18 read an article yesterday that uh or it was a little while ago I

00:51:39.22 mean this happened a little while ago but I read it yesterday that apparently

00:51:43.12 a bunch of American actors host shows in Russia because they on Russian state tv

00:51:48.10 because they couldn't get they can't get like people in Russia who want to host

00:51:52.15 them so I guess William shatner for a while hosted a show like a talk show in

00:51:58.15 Russia on like Russian state-run tv damn yeah I don't know if he still does

00:52:03.05 or not uh but I guess they they had like

00:52:05.01 import hosts in because they were having I don't know why I don't want to get in

00:52:08.11 politics but uh in that bizarre that yeah William shatner hosts the tv show

00:52:12.20 in Russia of all places is the hope that just people don't ever find that stuff

00:52:17.03 I mean I I I just looked it up and it's the article was from summer of

00:52:22.01 2021 so I guess people don't find it I just watched Tommy lee Jones laser

00:52:26.21 something what is happening

00:52:32.06 I'll post another comp this is complicated I would love to know how

00:52:36.09 much he got paid for this oh he makes so many it's not just that there are

00:52:40.09 countless Thomas lee Jones coffee commercials that are [ __ ] crazy isn't

00:52:45.01 this the pretty much the point of lost in translation right

00:52:49.07 is it I've never seen bill Murray went over

00:52:51.16 you guys never seen it like he was an American actor who went over and did

00:52:54.16 commercials and weird [ __ ] oh is that good movie yeah I remember

00:52:58.23 liking it a lot I I probably am [ __ ]

00:53:01.09 up the plot uh terribly but I remember really enjoying it it's early 2000's

00:53:07.11 that's a good way to describe it is tom I was trying to think of an actor

00:53:13.01 more so than this Tommy lee Jones very recognizable he's in some big movies

00:53:18.02 I am completely indifferent to him and I've never heard anybody say they love

00:53:23.22 Tommy lee Jones I love Tommy lee Jones really you're a big tom you're the guy

00:53:27.11 you're a Tommy lee Jones fan

00:53:30.17 he's solid but I've I've never heard anyone be like I'm excited or I'm going

00:53:35.13 to see this based on the fact that he is in this and he's got like a crusty old

00:53:40.10 wisdom face he does dude Tommy lee Jones in no country for

00:53:44.17 old men is one of the best performances I've ever seen in my life I'm apparently

00:53:49.23 just way off people like Tommy lee Jones way more

00:53:53.00 than I realized I was going through his imdb because he's creating a fugitive I

00:53:57.22 feel like he's in movies that you just haven't heard of I've been playing black

00:54:02.16 I mean these are classic captain america

00:54:05.12 you're right yeah these are some these are some real duds that's some obscure

00:54:10.23 [ __ ]

00:54:12.01 No I'm saying listen I'm not saying everything he's done is obscure but I

00:54:15.20 feel like he's somebody that you have a catalog of or you look at he's made like

00:54:20.06 200 or whatever movies and it's like what the [ __ ] is is this

00:54:24.15 I wonder what percentage of his films he remembers like if you sat him down I

00:54:29.11 said name every movie you're in do you think he'd get 50

00:54:33.07 or more I bet not I mean think of it this way and I know

00:54:37.11 this is a totally different but how many like old achievement hunter videos do

00:54:41.21 you see popping up on social media or Reddit that have you in them that you

00:54:45.04 click on that you feel like you're watching for the first time

00:54:49.11 oh yeah it happens quite a lot and you're like same with like stuff I've

00:54:53.08 worked on too like if like I always used to wonder why people

00:54:56.14 couldn't remember the stuff they've been

00:54:57.05 in like an actor on a film it's like how do you remember that it must have taken

00:55:01.02 up like a big chunk of your life but I couldn't I couldn't name

00:55:04.23 probably more than 20 of the commercials that I worked on

00:55:08.04 because it was just because it was probably like 200 or something and I

00:55:11.12 just I I all of it's gone straight out of my head and those were like long days

00:55:16.19 on set you know meeting people calling people Darren it's it's like a big

00:55:22.23 um I was looking through Tommy lee Jones as

00:55:26.08 imdb and just seeing like things that like I feel like actors of that era

00:55:32.00 especially are in just insane like kind of 70s 80s ridiculous plots I was like

00:55:36.17 could I find something weird there's a movie where Tommy lee Jones just plays a

00:55:41.11 character named tom lee I was like that's odd

00:55:43.22 and so I looked into it and every actor is just playing a character with the

00:55:48.03 same name essentially but there's an exception to that I thought this was

00:55:52.02 very funny I was looking through the list Elizabeth mormon as Eliza it's like I

00:55:57.06 can see the extension there Tommy lee Jones playing Tommy lee as tom lee Jones

00:56:03.05 rose quang as rose quang Chinese astrologer then Marcel sabrin pervert doctor

00:56:11.07 what movie is that I don't remember what it was called it

00:56:15.01 was very early in his in his career I think do you think on the cool sheet his

00:56:20.18 character's name was like dr Steve and then he saw the the credits and was like

00:56:25.12 doctor dr Marcel well what makes it even funnier to me is the guy below him is

00:56:30.06 Richard Manuel Richard bearded composer so like they gave him a name and a

00:56:34.02 profession they just he just gets pervert doctor

00:56:40.12 oh.

00:56:45.16 Wow I learned a lot I learned about Kevin bacon I'm excited to do a cup

00:56:50.08 I have ideas in my mind already so we're going to come are we collaborating on

00:56:54.20 the same cup or we're doing individual cup design I think we should all do our

00:56:58.21 own designs and then maybe like there's something in your cup that I didn't even

00:57:03.11 consider I think if we're gonna really flesh out this cup concept

00:57:06.18 uh we should get a bunch of cups on the table and see what we like and dislike

00:57:11.16 from the various designs all right now I got something like a hard one

00:57:14.23 you think it's hard really just just I'd

00:57:17.17 go with this uh just remember uh simpler is better typically

00:57:21.20 we're not trying to reinvent the wheel we're trying to reinvent the cup

00:57:27.09 well okay is there anything simple about the wrist pocket oh

00:57:32.00 I mean what's complicated or complex about that it's it couldn't be also

00:57:35.19 or on the topic of wrist pocket are we selling more wrist pockets are we going

00:57:39.07 to do more of that uh we don't have any plans currently why do you ask

00:57:42.15 well it's just it's uh we made a thousand tiki mugs and we did 50

00:57:46.02 wristbands yeah I don't understand the ratios there were only 50. Yeah there

00:57:51.01 were 50 of them technically there were 49 because I lost 49 of them yeah we did

00:57:55.08 a thousand tiki mugs I don't understand the ratio we must have lost money on

00:58:00.15 that uh I don't know I think we made money uh

00:58:04.06 hopefully I know that the people love them I know that a lot of a lot of

00:58:09.20 hard work and love and sweat and tears and uh effort went into making the the

00:58:13.23 49 special cards that I inserted into all of them and the person who got the

00:58:17.23 one of one uniform card already reached out and I've already put them in touch

00:58:21.07 with the rt store and they're getting one of everything we have you sent me a

00:58:25.12 video of someone unboxing one and it was phenomenal I love it phenomenal should

00:58:29.16 we put that should we link that yeah we absolutely should I think we probably

00:58:32.17 already did but we'll do it here too as well uh yeah that dude who did who it

00:58:36.08 was awesome he did a great job he top loaded it everything was very funny

00:58:40.04 showed off how practical the wrist pocket it was so like dry and like

00:58:44.00 not tongue-in-cheek it's all I loved it yeah I'll show you I had a premise this

00:58:47.20 randomly while Geoff and I were talking about the cups Gavin this randomly

00:58:51.20 popped in my head because I was thinking about the wrist pockets I would love to

00:58:55.10 have one we only made 50 so they're very hard to get do you remember have you

00:58:59.13 seen a season of survivor Gavin where they have done the challenge where it's

00:59:03.13 like three people in each tribe have a bar across their shoulders and they put

00:59:07.23 sandbags on it and whoever can last the longest wins immunity for that week it's

00:59:13.20 more of an old challenge oh well this is I want I want Geoff to recreate this

00:59:19.08 pocket I want to see how many pockets it would take to take down Geoff

00:59:24.17 that is awesome we should definitely do that if there is I don't know demand the

00:59:30.20 audience has to want it though uh I will absolutely do this survivor challenge

00:59:35.06 with wristbands oh my god because you just did that stream the the

00:59:39.17 everything must go go now which I haven't had a chance to watch yet but I

00:59:43.07 can't wait wait to do so I don't know I don't know you'll

00:59:51.12 yes well it's there uh but we should could it be like a thing where every

00:59:56.12 risk pocket sold or something gets added

00:59:59.12 to your poll and that's just how you end up with that's funny like some sort of

01:00:03.16 translation of trying to take down Geoff that's funny that's funny yeah

01:00:08.05 like it's like it's like how you like you buy a bo you buy a pair of bomb a

01:00:11.05 socks and they donate a pair of socks to a homeless person

01:00:13.23 or whatever exactly it is but it's like if you buy life

01:00:18.06 it donates one to my pain that's in the interesting sand oh oh you

01:00:23.07 know what we can see in the freaking dirt from the hole

01:00:26.18 you're only gonna be able to fill three wrist pockets with your puny ass tiny

01:00:31.20 little Danny my ass that's a whole mound outlet

01:00:34.19 we're on to something here with glass [ __ ] you we are on to something here

01:00:38.05 that's great that might be an angle to bring the wrist pocket back although I'm

01:00:41.07 not in a hurry to do a stream like the everything go must go go now it was fun

01:00:46.00 but easily the hardest I have ever worked in my life

01:00:50.10 I love the idea of us selling the dirt from your backyard let's get a ph

01:00:55.16 sample so.

01:00:59.02 [Applause]

01:01:00.10 This month Geoff's just covered in dirt.

01:01:05.07 I have to buy a new house [Laughter]

01:01:08.17 they're selling too well I wonder if we can sell enough wrist

01:01:13.01 pockets to justify me getting a pool

01:01:21.01 there's something so great about the money being made to like pay for your

01:01:26.12 pool and simultaneously getting rid of the dirt from the hole

01:01:30.03 I was thinking more of the dirt not the money but yeah oh my god we should

01:01:34.02 probably wrap up then uh I will say real

01:01:35.20 quick I just wanted to give you guys one piece of good news in my life because

01:01:40.00 there aren't many uh I uh I'm riding my bike every day again nice hey

01:01:44.16 yeah it's working great I got a new seat and that fixed everything

01:01:48.17 wonderful yeah battery I don't have my new I don't I

01:01:51.11 still have my new bike yet because that was a five month delay oh but you know I

01:01:55.15 do I made the old bike work and it's been awesome and there's been no butt

01:01:59.22 pain and I although um uh well I got my root canals done and uh

01:02:04.17 you know that was interesting I learned that you can get nitrous like

01:02:10.00 the gas that makes it go a lot faster and a lot easier uh and so that helped

01:02:13.17 um but uh yeah my mouth is fine the dot that I gotta go back in six months the

01:02:17.10 guy said that if I have any pain or discomfort to let him know and he will

01:02:20.19 pull it and then we will burn it or shoot it into space but there's no

01:02:24.13 saving it at this point like this is it it's his last chance this is the zit

01:02:30.04 it's on probation I got tooth probation on this guy

01:02:32.12 uh the only thing that the only weird thing is that um I was visited by the

01:02:37.16 gentle ghost again oh no yeah not the jet no that's not good I

01:02:41.20 sprained my ankle when I was visited by the gentle ghost

01:02:45.12 in the exact same spot like the exact same spot where the ghost pushed me down

01:02:51.16 the first time the ghost pushed me down again except this time it hurt more

01:02:57.03 and I got to thinking what if it's not a

01:02:59.12 ghost although I'm still really open and receptive to that possibility

01:03:04.00 what if there's a you know you guys heard of vortexes like supposedly sedona

01:03:09.03 Arizona is all vortexes right what if that what if I have found an Austin

01:03:12.22 Texas localized mini vortex and it just happens to be in a crosswalk.

01:03:19.03 I think we should investigate it's got to be just like a Bree like

01:03:23.21 something about the highway nearby or something is just causing some sort of

01:03:28.00 breeze I'm telling you it's not a breeze it was a ghost or a vortex

01:03:33.05 I I know it's not what you mean but every time you say vortex I think of

01:03:37.04 that nerf vortex football it just gets me excited what a great product that was

01:03:42.07 do you want to feel like a professional athlete go grab a vortex you can throw

01:03:45.22 it 600 yards at whistles what happened to those are they still in production I

01:03:50.06 have no idea but they're amazing I want to see which one of us can throw

01:03:54.01 a vortex football the farthest I would yeah I want to see the translation of

01:03:58.14 your your fastball which you still have to do again you have to set a second

01:04:01.23 number at some point yeah yeah we'll get there I just got we had bean holes to

01:04:06.17 dig we got 350 baseballs to hit apparently I have to hold a swimming

01:04:10.13 pool worth of dirt on my shoulders do you think you could hold the amount

01:04:15.15 of dirt we dug out the hole like as in its current state yeah for sure

01:04:20.04 really uh I definitely hold on I can I can look at it without a doubt

01:04:25.11 be right back just just right over there is he gonna get a look he said for sure

01:04:31.01 and then immediately like went back it's a lot of dirt you know it's quite

01:04:36.23 right no I don't know I I do think that it's more dirt than he probably thought

01:04:42.19 it was but to say for sure and then go well

01:04:46.08 is really something so not for sure at all not for sure I'll I'll say this

01:04:51.08 it'll be close it'll be close that image that you post looks like

01:04:58.08 it looked like you made him bury his own grave and he got that far

01:05:04.08 that's what I'm saying nobody's digging graves nobody

01:05:11.05 I want that reconstructed but it's just your foot in the hole

01:05:16.13 we should get that we should get that drawn out as a logo

01:05:21.22 like a very simple like nba style like ian's like ian face drawn out if

01:05:27.03 anyone asks me what this show is I'm just gonna show him this picture

01:05:31.16 oh my god I ordered something so cool the other day and I know I know I know I

01:05:37.05 know I know we're ending and I'm gonna end too uh but uh as I was numbering all

01:05:41.20 those those cards that I I stamped and then numbered hand numbered for the uh

01:05:46.22 for the wrist pockets I thought if I do this again I wanted to I want to improve

01:05:50.21 each time I wanted to get better so I got uh tony and the the ecom guys to buy

01:05:56.23 me a gold foil stamper it looks like a giant drill press and it like heats up a

01:06:02.13 gold foil and then you like put in like brass plates of numbers it's very heavy

01:06:06.12 very unwieldy but it works like a charm uh and I was able so I can make golden

01:06:10.19 numbers now but I'm not satisfied with numbers so I found this place on etsy

01:06:16.04 that makes custom designs and so I've ordered a bunch of custom ian brass

01:06:19.19 plates so I can put the the face on stuff the official face seal yeah the

01:06:25.01 official face I was gonna do the face logo but I

01:06:27.21 didn't want to have the conversation with the very sweet old lady who was

01:06:30.21 making it so I just said how about this instead and she was like I don't get it

01:06:35.20 but okay I uh we're talking about like different

01:06:39.14 increasing the absurdity because this all started the first thing you marked

01:06:44.00 with was was like a it was a torch right like a blowtorch type thing what were

01:06:48.01 you using oh that was you had an engraving

01:06:50.20 or a wooden graveyard I still have you had an engraver and then you had the

01:06:53.23 wood burner and now you have a [ __ ]

01:06:55.22 printing press in your house and it's just I want this evolution to continue

01:06:59.21 to the point I don't know how they make these if we can somehow get a signature

01:07:05.01 on a tire tread I just want you driving over a line of things

01:07:08.23 that's a great idea dude can I tell you I had a the other day unironically

01:07:12.20 without hyperbole I had a conversation with Emily when I was looking at the

01:07:15.03 heat press I was trying to figure out where to store it and I thought I went

01:07:18.12 to Emily and I said I think we need to buy a bigger house I need a room

01:07:23.04 I need a room for all the face devices so I'm going to be looking into that why

01:07:28.14 not just build a face shed well half my backyard's a hole now

01:07:34.04 you're gonna have to build up from that that ground because it's impenetrable

01:07:38.20 the dirt he has in his backyard I think we're halfway to digging the official

01:07:44.02 face bunker and that's where it'll be that's a lot of rocks we've got

01:07:49.05 thanks for listening [ __ ]

01:07:51.18 love you that's awesome eric's gonna get mad if we don't end he

01:07:57.18 keeps saying what is happening in the episode do it nice ending all right well

01:08:03.00 it's that time again uh you've spent the last oh I don't know depending on

01:08:08.06 editing hour and hour to hour and five minutes laughing and learning and maybe

01:08:12.01 crying a little bit and being challenged emotionally and mentally and and coming

01:08:16.21 out the other side maybe a little wiser a little tougher and uh maybe a little

01:08:21.13 better mood and we we sure hope that was the case at least uh because it it it

01:08:25.21 definitely was for some of us not all of us you know who we're talking about

01:08:29.20 if you like the episode or even if it was just eh but you didn't hate it why

01:08:34.05 don't you go ahead and give us a review or a like or a positive thing or mail
