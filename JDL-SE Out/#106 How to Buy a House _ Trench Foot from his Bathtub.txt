00:00:15.09 What's with your fridge it's just like not a fridge like nothing nothing sticks

00:00:20.05 to it it doesn't make anything cold well it's one of those like fancy metal

00:00:24.13 fridges where nothing sticks to it on purpose

00:00:27.14 and it's not supposed to get like smudgy or dirty or anything

00:00:32.10 you bought a fridge that does no no no no no

00:00:36.06 no I did not buy a fridge I bought a house that contained a fridge oh I

00:00:41.03 didn't buy this fridge I would not have bought this 400 year old ge monogram

00:00:46.02 monster of a fridge that's not quite as big as most of those cool walk-in deep

00:00:51.03 freezer fridges that you see in fancy houses but definitely big and bigger

00:00:56.03 than a normal one in just the right way so that there's only seven models on

00:01:00.05 earth and replacement parts from my fridge are impossible because it hasn't

00:01:03.18 been made in 25 years I would not do that I agree hey Gavin did you know that

00:01:07.18 uh Geoff didn't buy his fridge he came with a house episode 106. Go ahead huh

00:01:11.23 okay did you did you buy your fridge gav

00:01:14.08 or did you buy a house that had a fridge in it outside of fridge yeah I wouldn't

00:01:17.18 and my point being I understand that by buying the house I bought the fridge but

00:01:23.07 I didn't buy the fridge I didn't set out to get this [ __ ] fridge if I had I

00:01:27.09 would deserve every bit of uh shad and Freud coming my way but I didn't I

00:01:31.13 bought a house I had no idea that the house was going to contain a lemon

00:01:34.21 fridge well I I mean I assume you walked through the house I'm I'm sure you

00:01:38.16 realize what the first what's he gonna do say no to the fridge yeah I hadn't

00:01:42.12 had any time with him that would have been I don't know

00:01:45.15 when you like closed out a house it would be a very funny specific request

00:01:49.20 of I want you to take the fridge with you I will only I will only buy this

00:01:53.10 home if you take the fridge I will uh I will also say this is gonna sound like

00:01:57.17 uh this is not it's not it's not how it's gonna sound cooler than how it went

00:02:01.16 down but I actually did buy the house without walking through it first I I was

00:02:05.21 on vacation in Mexico when it went for sale and the mo the moment it went for

00:02:09.23 sale Emily saw it and said look at this house and I called my agent and I said

00:02:13.04 put it on that house so I had put an offer on the house but a week before I

00:02:17.07 saw it well I I feel like I have less sympathy for you now than if you would

00:02:20.23 have went in and evaluated the fridge you bought a house unseen you have to

00:02:26.10 like that's what's up in the process I've bought tvs where I've been to best

00:02:30.17 buy like 10 or 11 times before I put the

00:02:33.11 trigger on it and you just go on a place you gotta live listen listen

00:02:39.09 if the if the Austin tv market was anything like the Austin housing market

00:02:44.13 I would take that criticism however I went I tried to buy 10 or 11 houses that

00:02:49.06 were taken away from me by richer people then by the time I got this house I was

00:02:54.13 desperate I was desperate I had to extend my lease and the part in the

00:02:58.01 place downtown an extra eight months because I couldn't find a [ __ ] house

00:03:02.06 that's not true I found a ton of houses I found so many houses I couldn't get

00:03:05.18 anybody to sell them to me I remember being really mad at myself when I bought

00:03:10.04 my first house and I didn't check the attic like I didn't go

00:03:13.19 up into the ceiling and I was like how how did I buy a house with basically

00:03:18.10 without looking at one of the rooms I was like I can't believe I did that but

00:03:21.13 I guess it's not a common thing to walk a house or go to an open house and climb

00:03:25.22 into the loft no but don't you I've never bought a home but I feel like

00:03:29.06 don't you hire the guy that inspects everything and I feel like that's his

00:03:32.22 job to do that it's just yeah it it like that guy looks for problems but it's

00:03:36.10 like I didn't I didn't really even know if there was a space like you know you

00:03:39.17 get like a an attic that has like it's full of insulation and you can't really

00:03:43.00 put anything in there and some are just like completely unfinished and you can

00:03:46.04 fall through the floor it's like that was an unknown after I had the keys and

00:03:50.03 I felt I felt pretty dumb for that what you're saying is there needs to be a

00:03:53.04 second guy that's just purely there to evaluate vibes you got the guy that's

00:03:56.19 there for problems and then you have like

00:04:04.02 would be great was not to pivot away from this great

00:04:07.21 house conversation was the last time you went into a best buy to look at tvs

00:04:12.20 I was thinking about this six months ago I bought a new tv six

00:04:17.01 months ago yeah really do they still have the tv section of a best buy or

00:04:22.17 like any of those places to me feels like the used car salesman area of

00:04:26.20 the store where there's always the insane gimmick tv that they have for

00:04:31.02 display and that is part of the experience of walking the store it's

00:04:35.02 like for a time it was 3d then it was curved like I don't know what the

00:04:38.11 current tv gimmick is but I'm sure that station still exists I feel like it's

00:04:42.03 important to walk the tv floor because I feel like for me I've always stood in

00:04:45.22 the middle I've always been like I need to get middle of the range I don't want

00:04:49.19 the dog [ __ ] but I'm not gonna you know I'm not gonna pull the trigger on a

00:04:53.06 five-figure television you know that's all like the home theater top end so

00:04:56.11 it's like I need to know where I stand in the scale by just looking at them and

00:04:59.12 then I'll go and buy it somewhere else typically that makes sense interesting

00:05:04.00 why do you buy it somewhere else oh yeah that's a great question uh

00:05:07.20 just easier in it I mean you're already there looking at

00:05:10.13 it I don't I can't think of what would be easier than telling the person I like

00:05:14.10 this tv I'm just gonna buy it from you right now it seems a lot harder or more

00:05:18.11 effort to go I like this tv a lot I'm gonna go home and then find another

00:05:21.12 place to buy it well chances are it's probably cheaper somewhere else and also

00:05:24.21 I have to if I'd buy it there I've got to take it don't I've got like put it no

00:05:28.17 they'll deliver it in someone's car I am with Gavin fully the last tv I bought

00:05:32.18 they brought it home and installed it for me for free all right that's you

00:05:36.01 know what that's fair I think you're probably right I think Gavin and I are

00:05:39.02 just ignorant to it I'm going through an experience right now where I'm looking

00:05:43.04 at buying like a deck chair or a couch for the deck and I kind of want to do it

00:05:47.04 on amazon just because I know it'll get here but I plan on going to other places

00:05:51.15 to look at like what's available in the market but I have no plans on buying it

00:05:55.20 outside of amazon but if I can schedule that also it's a weird issue for me

00:05:59.12 where I don't trust they'll find my door so maybe that's specific to my

00:06:04.17 my living situation but also Andrew I completely and totally

00:06:08.00 agree with you about the tv section of best buy it feels like and I don't know

00:06:11.08 if this is a reference you'll even understand but it feels like the

00:06:15.14 spiritual successor uh to circuit city which was a store from a

00:06:20.16 different different age yeah that's well we had best buy was kind of a later

00:06:24.16 edition we had future shop in Canada originally but I feel like all those

00:06:28.06 stores have to be united in the tv that cost

00:06:31.13 way too much money with the shitty couch that's set up in front of it and them

00:06:35.06 trying to convince you that this is the future well there's no way it will be

00:06:38.15 yeah I like that that nick saying it's apparently the picture frame tv I have

00:06:42.12 never looked at a tv and thought I wish this didn't look like a tv that's such a

00:06:47.08 strange gimmick for me I totally buy I'm totally into that picture frame tv idea

00:06:51.23 are you completely because a picture frame looks it that like nick says it

00:06:55.13 looks great looks like there's a tv you have to keep on is that what it is

00:06:59.20 I mean no I just think it's supposed to look like you're it's supposed to be

00:07:03.23 classy it's supposed to be like looking for a picture frame when you turn it off

00:07:07.04 it looks like an empty frame you know where you can you know where you can

00:07:10.07 check one out now it's like you have like a screen

00:07:13.00 server going so it looks like a painting or something yeah so you never keep it

00:07:16.14 on sure yeah it just seems a little wasteful if I'm not in the room I don't

00:07:20.01 need to like I don't need it to look like art

00:07:23.14 yeah I guess but it's nice to hide a tv which looks like a big [ __ ]

00:07:28.04 like I don't know I get it I'm totally I'm totally pro as a matter of fact if

00:07:32.18 you go into the stf office at the day job they have one uh I mean they made

00:07:36.09 their made it themselves it's not like a purchased one but it looks great it

00:07:39.18 looks [ __ ] like you want to hide the tv it's like what what what's the phone

00:07:43.13 but still it looks like it's pointing at a cool piece of art like a like a

00:07:46.12 picture of your granddad I feel like you need a specific outlet

00:07:49.18 situation too because no picture frame has a cord that just runs from the

00:07:53.00 bottom like as soon as you get cords and

00:07:54.17 the illusion is ruined well hopefully if you're putting a tv on the wall you're

00:07:58.10 hiding the cables well at the power outlets they're always

00:08:01.09 low I very rarely see a mid-level power outlet I feel like you got to reach for

00:08:05.03 that you can't go wireless on the power outlet what happened to those tvs by the

00:08:09.04 way just playing like a film or something like something that I'd

00:08:12.03 actually watch like when when do you buy a tv and think I'm gonna watch some

00:08:17.09 extremely high frame rate apples bounce off a wet table like

00:08:20.13 nobody's watching that oh you don't it's all crap it's all like demo footage

00:08:25.11 what's something real on there you had me at apples honestly [Laughter]

00:08:30.12 I feel like I remember it always being weird action movies like ultraviolet

00:08:35.11 like a movie nobody would actually sit down and watch or buy but like it's hd

00:08:39.21 we'll buy this somebody was convinced to buy a curved tv because of ultraviolet

00:08:44.16 and what a mistake that was on several not fan of the curve I just I've never

00:08:49.16 experienced it and I don't trust that it

00:08:53.16 in any way makes the experience better I

00:08:56.01 do feel like the curve fad is over yes I feel like it's over for tvs but it's

00:09:01.03 still around for monitors um because I oh yeah that would make sense I do I was

00:09:04.18 about to say I just looked over to the right and I do have a curved monitor so

00:09:09.09 I guess I guess I'm into curved monitors but I

00:09:12.05 only got it because Alfredo told me to buy it what about curved fridge dude I

00:09:16.00 would like any fridge just I'll take anything.

00:09:19.14 I wanted to feel like my fridge is hugging me I want the doors to come out

00:09:23.21 wide want the wrap around you well you bought your house without going inside

00:09:28.07 um would you recommend that as a process uh it worked out well for me um I mean

00:09:32.16 eventually I did so basically the way it works if you don't know how to buy a

00:09:36.06 house or how one buys a house if you thought you see a house you like you put

00:09:39.11 down earnest money and it basically is like I'm gonna put down like 500 bucks

00:09:43.03 or whatever and then I have like a an option period where if I just change my

00:09:47.04 mind within the seven day option period I get my 500 bucks back no big deal if I

00:09:51.15 don't uh then I gotta buy the house and if I back out later then they get the

00:09:54.20 500 bucks it's like an insurance to keep people from uh just like I don't know

00:09:58.19 like claiming houses they don't like I'm gonna I'm gonna put money down on these

00:10:02.15 seven houses and then I'll buy one of them right I assume people do that you

00:10:06.10 weren't fully committed yeah so I put the earnest money down and I entered the

00:10:09.14 option period and then when I got home from my vacation I immediately went and

00:10:12.23 looked at the house and then and then I walked to the house and and I was

00:10:16.10 totally uh I was totally on board at that point so it's like making a

00:10:17.18 reservation like a paid reservation yeah it's like a paid reservation oh you got

00:10:22.17 it interesting I guess uh I guess we started the podcast at some point oh intro

00:10:28.02 no I mean I think Eric did the intro this week but just uh I didn't realize

00:10:32.09 we'd even started did you guys have any what do you guys want to talk about

00:10:36.15 today I had one situation that happened where you know like those those things

00:10:40.00 were like it felt very faced where I was just doing a pretty casual thing

00:10:45.13 and then it escalated into much worse to like a dumb dilemma I guess first the

00:10:51.11 story begins I fell down the stairs and not not many

00:10:55.20 I fell down hold on are you okay yeah oh my god my legs were.

00:11:01.18 I fell down a stair stairs is is an exaggeration I was trying to step

00:11:06.21 I was trying to step around my cat when I had a bunch of things in my hands and

00:11:12.13 I was unsuccessful and my cat is totally fine but I was not I had both legs were

00:11:17.12 very sore so this is like

00:11:20.02 your legs yeah like I landed weirdly and then I

00:11:23.12 hurt I hurt my one leg and then I was over compensating on the other leg

00:11:28.20 because of that leg which then resulted in both legs being sore but it's fine

00:11:34.03 now did you stumble and then catch yourself or did you go down I stumbled

00:11:38.20 and then I I kind of like landed into the couch so it wasn't the worst thing

00:11:42.14 but it was really the stumble was the issue for the leg that was hurt and then

00:11:46.11 resulted in a double you can make it from the stairs to the couch like just

00:11:50.11 jumping it's it's very narrow I mean when you guys are here you'll see it's

00:11:53.18 not much of a distance it was like I kind of fell forward I got like one step

00:11:58.19 forward and I can make it largely to the couch um

00:12:01.14 it's a small room that that walk at air it's so weird this house is shaped so

00:12:05.09 weird I can't wait for you guys to see it I cannot wait to see it there's no

00:12:09.01 way it's gonna meet my my mental picture I know I just think you're living in

00:12:13.13 like a spiral shoe or something so I had that happen and I hurt both my

00:12:18.07 legs and I couldn't sleep I was having dinner

00:12:21.01 do you need me to send you more bubble wrap are you running low no I'm good

00:12:24.03 bubble wrap honestly would have been helpful but um I'm fine thanks so I I

00:12:29.05 was like I can't sleep my legs feel really tight I'm gonna have a nice bath

00:12:33.07 and I'm just gonna rest I'm gonna enjoy this and just maybe like it'll loosen up

00:12:38.12 my legs a little bit so I have a bath it's now 3 a.m

00:12:42.12 and uh there are my my bath is also shockingly a weird shape there's a

00:12:47.01 little shelf on the side of it but it's super narrow and it's filled with

00:12:50.21 shampoo bottles that my partner uses and one of them is [ __ ] massive it's like

00:12:56.10 a brick so and I always knock them over constantly but it's 3am I don't want to

00:13:01.03 alert or disturb anybody so I'm climbing out of the bath and as I'm climbing out

00:13:06.13 of the bath in complete darkness I go a little too far back and I feel my

00:13:11.00 ass hit all three of the bottoms mainly one we have one that's like

00:13:15.08 center with my ass and the other I just know we're there so I'm like oh [ __ ]

00:13:19.06 what do I do so I hold this like kind of

00:13:21.13 crouch position and then I pin all three like I'm a wrestler putting all my

00:13:26.10 pressure on my ass on these bottles on the wall

00:13:28.23 and I slowly reach around to try to grab what I can so I'm able to grab two of

00:13:33.12 the three the other one is like center with my ass and so I grab them and as

00:13:37.17 long as it's the brick one like one of the two I'm good I can let the other

00:13:41.02 ones fall it won't be like a [ __ ]

00:13:43.04 stone being thrown through like it's so loud whenever it falls so I pull pull

00:13:47.09 the other two forward and it's the two small ones like of course it's the too

00:13:51.00 small so I'm like [ __ ] I can't reach this I'm gonna knock this like what do I

00:13:54.21 do it's in the middle of my ass so after a few minutes

00:13:58.23 I decide I think I can clench this this is a heavy weight come on but I think

00:14:05.01 come on I think I can do this because I don't know what else to do I don't want

00:14:10.17 to make a loud noise so I clench the brick as hard as I can I'm

00:14:15.07 just squeezing so hard and I'm so nervous that if I move away from the

00:14:20.21 wall at all it will fall and just everything will crash and it will be

00:14:24.01 pointless so I squeeze and I slowly enjoy and as I inch nothing's falling so

00:14:29.07 I feel great about it and then I put my hand back and I don't feel the bottle so

00:14:33.17 I think holy [ __ ] I've actually clinched this thing now what do I do because I

00:14:38.05 have the tallest tub in the world it's like doing a [ __ ] thing

00:14:42.19 you say you can't tell whether something's clenched in your ass or not

00:14:46.02 I like you feel with your hand no I was no I was feeling back because I was

00:14:50.06 clenched so hard and I had been in the tub like I just didn't have I didn't

00:14:53.20 trust myself it was the dark I was so paranoid I just couldn't tell I was

00:14:58.07 nervous I was clenching harder than anyone's ever clenched before again this

00:15:04.04 is a tight this is an anaconda-like grip in my ass with this bottle

00:15:07.19 so I'm squeezing and then I'm stuck because I can't get over the top I'm

00:15:13.11 thinking like if I lift my leg I will undeniably release clench and I can't

00:15:19.01 like it falling at that point so I stood

00:15:22.19 at 3am I'm standing naked in my bathroom in the dark with a shampoo bottle

00:15:27.18 clenched between my ass wondering how am I going to get out of this so I start I

00:15:31.22 decide I just have to go for it and hope so

00:15:36.13 what do you think it

00:15:43.18 it's one of those large I'oreal bottles I really didn't want it I would feel so

00:15:49.10 bad if I woke someone up so I I like hunch over I get low and I

00:15:54.02 start lifting my leg and every inch my heart is racing faster fast because like

00:15:59.09 this bottle is gonna [ __ ] fall this bottle's gonna fall it's gonna fall

00:16:03.12 and I eventually get halfway over and the clench is so loose and no noise has

00:16:07.14 happened I'm like there's no [ __ I way that I clench this thing there's it

00:16:10.18 would have fallen by now so I just step over

00:16:13.04 and uh I turn the light on I look it's just on the wall I never had it I just

00:16:17.12 stood I stood for like five minutes clenching my ass in my bath for no reason

00:16:23.07 terrified that I was gonna drop this thing that was never there I think when

00:16:29.01 I thought it was in your ass.

00:16:32.00 I think when I pressed when I did like the wrestler press on the wall I just

00:16:36.20 pushed it into a place where it wouldn't fall it was fine and so I did all that

00:16:42.00 process for nothing there was no issue of it

00:16:45.03 falling I was all good so now I'm like I'm a [ __ ] idiot but at least I could

00:16:49.06 talk about this on the show so I sit at my desk and I have a drink and I'm like

00:16:53.14 kind of laughing about what has just happened

00:16:55.16 you know those like little those like grocery bags that are they're like cloth

00:16:59.10 like they're super light they're small or whatever yeah I'm like I'm gonna go

00:17:02.19 into bed now but I have one of those in my way I'm just going to get rid of this

00:17:06.05 I'm just going to throw it out of my path so I grab it and throw it without

00:17:11.11 like it's one solid motion and I remember I put a heavy candle in the bag

00:17:16.14 earlier that day so after all that effort I threw a [ __ ] candle against

00:17:22.06 the wall immediately and it just rattled out like all of that it was so [ __ ]

00:17:27.17 loud I did all that effort to be quiet I realized how dumb I was sat down and

00:17:31.23 then just threw a heavy candle at the wall immediately by

00:17:36.08 so that was my weekend that was Sunday I want to say I

00:17:40.10 that was a highly entertaining story but the most entertaining might have been

00:17:44.08 listening to Gavin absolutely

00:17:50.23 what would you have done in that situation Gavin I guess I mean I think I

00:17:56.02 probably would have navigated it more uh svelte than that but uh I I get I

00:18:00.10 wouldn't I guess you could have just clinched it all the way to the bed and

00:18:04.04 just gone to sleep with a shampoo bottle in your butt I mean I would never go

00:18:07.07 that far that as soon as I was out of the it was actually a thought I had of

00:18:10.11 how do I if this is clenched in my ass how do I drop this like do I have to go

00:18:15.12 to the bed and then release their what is the quietest mechanism for doing

00:18:20.02 it in other situations I have a great awareness of what is and is not in my

00:18:25.14 ass but it was just the stakes the stakes were high Gavin well I mean think

00:18:29.14 about it it's pitch black you're in pain it's three in the morning you're half

00:18:33.06 asleep you've been in the water for a while this you're essentially coming out

00:18:37.02 of a sleep deprivation tank or a sensory deprivation tank right so you're

00:18:40.17 probably all discombobulated right now yeah I had that happen recent I fell

00:18:44.15 asleep in the tub like sometimes I'll fall asleep and have like a little

00:18:48.03 30-minute nap how can one person have so we could write a book with stories from

00:18:52.16 that single room it's like the most important place in your entire

00:18:56.17 life I can't believe we're still learning more about the bathtub like I

00:19:01.06 thought we'd we understood everything there was another I don't even know

00:19:04.21 about the shelf and that it's taller but wait are you

00:19:07.23 saying like we can have you go in there now and shove the I'oreal in your ass

00:19:12.18 and see if you can feel the difference I definitely could feel the difference in

00:19:16.15 this context do you want me to you want me to drop the I'oreal like it normally

00:19:20.04 would see if it comes across I could do that it's [ __ ] loud yeah drop it from

00:19:25.03 your ass cheeks though we should do a we

00:19:28.14 maybe we should say we maybe should's is not the right word we could do like an

00:19:32.22 ass Olympics where we all stick shampoo bottles in our butts and then we see who

00:19:37.00 can walk the farm the obstacle course how many flights of stairs you can do it

00:19:40.23 sounds like it didn't go well why is Andrew yelling oh no didn't go

00:19:45.05 shot [ __ ] shampoo all over his house do you think from his ass

00:19:49.10 do you think if it wasn't his ass he tells his partner that shampoo was up

00:19:54.00 his arse so does he just pretend maybe it's like uh maybe it's like the

00:19:58.01 way it works in my house and my girlfriend finds out when if and when

00:20:01.10 she listens to the podcast what what when her stuff's been in your ass yeah

00:20:06.21 like whatever just anything did that come through at all yeah

00:20:10.20 that was great so I went to tilt my mic so it would be facing more with the

00:20:15.17 bathroom but it's on this stand I'm on a shitty like little table and the mic is

00:20:20.05 too heavy for the table if you put its different angles so I twisted it and the

00:20:23.12 whole table started to fall over so I was trying to juggle the table so that

00:20:27.07 wasn't the sound of shampoo well there was a second sound after that I don't

00:20:31.18 know if that picked up oh okay I'm not sure it was very loud though anyway

00:20:36.14 I fell asleep in the tub recently yeah and typically if I have a little nap

00:20:42.12 it'll be like 30 minutes nice little 30 minute rest uh soaking or

00:20:47.11 whatever uh I fell asleep and it I was in there for six hours

00:20:52.06 I woke up it was six hours later wasn't it freezing

00:20:56.13 uh I was not cold the issue was my feet were in incredible pain they pruned so

00:21:01.08 hard at first I was like this is fine I'm gonna be like this is a

00:21:06.04 little annoying maybe I go back to sleep and sketch another hour uh but the

00:21:11.01 pruning was so bad I was like nah I should really I surely I need to d prune

00:21:16.00 so like I got out of the bath and my foot was they were both super pruned and

00:21:21.03 not good they hurt so much and so I'm like go ogling what is going on

00:21:26.06 I learned that there's a thing called trench foot but I don't think

00:21:35.11 no no no it was all extended but that's just what I was trying to find things so

00:21:41.03 they de-pruned throughout the day but I didn't bathroom

00:21:45.11 that happens that was like [ __ ] that happened to soldiers in world war one

00:21:50.10 man well I I searched my feet are very ruined

00:21:53.22 I was trying to determine how long it would take for the d prune dab so you

00:21:58.15 were you just too scared to stand on the pruning no I stood and it hurt a lot on

00:22:02.15 both feet like every step hurt and then I was laying in bed and it still hurt

00:22:08.00 they were still the prune hurt so do you think you weighed like 50 pounds more

00:22:13.15 from all the water I don't know why are my legs so heavy

00:22:17.09 oh they're too hydrated an important thing to remember with the shampoo

00:22:21.07 bottle story you're going back because you're judging me on that Gavin you fell

00:22:25.09 down the stairs recently or a stair recently you gotta remember your

00:22:28.21 mobility is not 100 your legs are sore it's like you got two clamps on your

00:22:33.12 feet right your movement is restricted I mean that's fair so are you walking

00:22:37.22 around okay how are we doing are you able to get out to the bagel shop yeah

00:22:42.03 I'm good they decided to take a long weekend on Sunday and I was like I'm

00:22:45.12 gonna go on Sunday and because it's a Monday was a day off today or yesterday

00:22:49.12 in Canada so they gave their staff a long long weekend which is awesome and

00:22:52.17 so well deserved but I was it has become Wednesday through Sunday

00:22:56.09 have become my favorite days of the week just because it means I can go to that

00:23:00.23 shop I love it so much it's great so it was it was uh

00:23:03.22 unfortunate to be like oh no I can't go tomorrow I plan on going on Sunday

00:23:07.21 but outside I'm good you go to the bagel shop I'm all set you about ready for

00:23:11.20 that marathon then uh you know we still got a few weeks left in the redemption

00:23:17.05 year this is 106 right he still got his legs on the training board [Music]

00:23:22.03 speaking of redemption here man the comment leavers are loving you right now

00:23:25.13 for the Greg thing yeah I saw somebody I thought they made

00:23:28.19 such a funny comment I wish I remembered who did it but someone said the the

00:23:32.12 person that said that saying Greg from finance is not the same as Greg and

00:23:35.17 accounting I think I flipped it there but Greg and accounting not the same as

00:23:39.16 Greg and finances like saying the answer wasn't superman it's kal-el I thought

00:23:42.23 that was very funny I read that one the one that I was going to point out and

00:23:46.06 why sometimes I really love the comment leavers there were two comments this

00:23:49.05 week that just I wrote down on my phone because I loved him so much uh one was a

00:23:53.20 person who said uh in the podcast Eric mentioned we need a stronger verb than

00:23:58.21 salad creaming I I I propose we call it gregging which I [ __ ] love

00:24:03.15 like you've really [ __ ] up if you Greg something yeah

00:24:07.07 and the other one that was funny which was totally different but uh

00:24:10.19 somebody said we should make an Alexa prayer candle which I thought was pretty

00:24:14.10 funny [Laughter]

00:24:15.18 I there was one other comment I saw where somebody brought up that like yeah

00:24:19.15 my brother used to invent rules as we went so he wouldn't lose and I I was

00:24:23.16 like I didn't do that I just didn't vocalize them like I see where you're

00:24:27.12 coming from that's that was my fault I should have I should have been clear

00:24:30.19 from the beginning that's where I [ __ ]

00:24:33.07 up I understand like the fluster and like the oh which way do I go with this

00:24:36.21 but I feel like everyone would have gone the other way [Laughter]

00:24:41.03 I think I think a different day I would have but

00:24:44.00 I had spent so much time the night before thinking about how long should I

00:24:48.09 give you guys how this will be like maybe we'll amp it up a little bit this

00:24:52.08 will be exciting down the stretch and you just got it immediately instantly I

00:24:56.12 was not prepared I did not consider this possibility it was a very good hint I

00:25:01.18 got a text I got a text today from our friend James

00:25:05.09 Buckley who listens to this podcast who is

00:25:07.03 does Buckley listen to this podcast yeah yeah he was in the in between us and uh

00:25:12.00 he just texted me today saying what is Andrew panton

00:25:19.20 well that's what we've been trying to figure out for 106 [ __ ] episodes and

00:25:25.18 I don't know any closer oh god oh man I did something today if if you

00:25:31.09 guys don't mind I did something today that I haven't done in a really long

00:25:35.21 time it almost feels like too long when I realized how long it had been since it

00:25:42.02 happened uh it's sock related no no a bicycle really

00:25:44.19 oh bike related that's yeah that was a great guess Gavin you're kidding that's

00:25:50.04 great was it gentle ghost no but I did wreck my bike today

00:25:54.19 I haven't wrecked my vikings so [ __ ]

00:25:57.11 long and I did today for sure time out is this the new bike that you've been

00:26:00.23 waiting months for no no no no I don't have the new bike yet no okay it's an

00:26:04.13 important so the way it worked is you know I had all

00:26:07.04 those issues with my bike uh was exploding on me and stuff and uh that's

00:26:12.10 why I bought a eric's like I saw you four hours ago well two hours ago I was

00:26:17.07 on the ground well actually I wasn't uh so uh did you say yeah between

00:26:22.06 no no mitten knocking I'm [ __ ] great I feel great uh well well well okay so

00:26:27.12 I'm a little sore in the shoulder and neck area from the wrenching but uh I

00:26:32.01 don't have any scrapes or anything uh because I pulled it off quite well uh

00:26:35.23 but anyway yeah no Andrew so I bought that new bike in like January or

00:26:39.10 whatever so sure of course I don't have it yet and when I called to find out

00:26:43.00 when I would get it they were basically like go [ __ ] yourself we'll give it to

00:26:46.09 you when we feel like it so I don't know sometime around that hopefully but

00:26:50.15 before I get the fridge I'll get uh the new bike so uh

00:26:54.04 yeah I I the goal when I bought the new one was that like I just won't ride this

00:26:57.20 other bike that has tried to kill me a few times

00:27:00.15 but then when my butt stopped hurting and I honestly I started to put on the

00:27:04.12 some weight for being too idle I was like I dusted off the bike and got it

00:27:08.23 working again and and it's been a really reliable bike uh to this point um

00:27:13.03 today I was just like it's one of those times where like I was going down the

00:27:17.05 hike and bike trail and it's uh it's like gravel you know and I just

00:27:21.08 I just caught an edge going I wasn't going fast I was going like maybe 14

00:27:25.07 miles an hour I caught an edge and I was just like about to turn right into a

00:27:29.01 street and then suddenly the bi I just looked down and I felt the bike get

00:27:32.05 taken away from me and everything would happen in slow motion and the my

00:27:35.15 handlebars kept going further and further out and then the next thing I

00:27:38.19 knew I was just running with the handlebars and then the handlebars just

00:27:42.06 got taken away from me and then I just kept running and I never fell down the

00:27:45.18 bike slid across the street and I just kept running and then I just did a

00:27:49.12 little turn around and I went back over to pick my bike up like [ __ ] cool as

00:27:54.08 [ __ ] and I look up and there are five people on bicycles staring at me and I

00:27:58.09 go oh hey and one of the guys goes that was really [ __ ] cool and I go oh

00:28:03.04 thanks yeah it worked out okay and the other one was like wow that was almost

00:28:07.07 bad and then they just rode away and I just got on my bike and I kept writing

00:28:11.11 play I couldn't do it on purpose a million tries I couldn't I couldn't

00:28:16.02 pull it off why is it that whenever you describe

00:28:18.07 you on a bike I can never wrap my head around the physics of it like when you

00:28:21.15 were describing the jump like what everything you just said I don't know how

00:28:26.21 I don't know what you said so I was riding and then the bike hit an

00:28:30.11 edge of like gravel and it just swung out from under me to the left and then

00:28:34.11 the bike just went out in front of me and then suddenly I just wasn't on it

00:28:38.23 anymore I was just running like it fell out from under me and I

00:28:43.01 have all of our animators animate what they think happened

00:28:45.20 here's the weird thing right I get back on my bike and I go and I'm riding it

00:28:49.23 and I realize yeah I ripped it I mean I like I really wrenched my shoulder and

00:28:52.04 my neck so I assume I'll be miserable tomorrow but I'm you know it's not bad

00:28:56.04 yet and I'm riding and I can't I can't explain it and I can't I can't

00:29:01.14 point to how but my bike is better like I wrecked like the wreck tuned my bike

00:29:08.00 up it's like it was faster it was easier to pedal it was smoother

00:29:15.09 it was it felt tight like felt more fluid I don't know how to describe it

00:29:21.02 other than the bike that I got back on is

00:29:24.12 probably 30 better than the bike I laid down

00:29:27.18 and I did not hit my head I promise nick's asking if I hit my head I don't

00:29:32.08 understand it but I was I was in disbelief I didn't trust it I was like

00:29:36.08 something clearly is like been stretched

00:29:38.11 and is about to break because this feels

00:29:40.06 too weird and too like I checked all the gears everything and but no I drove and

00:29:44.09 you know this happened to mile 12 of a 22 mile bike ride so I had another 10

00:29:47.22 miles and it just like it just it was just great like the bike is great now do

00:29:52.10 you think you accidentally swapped bikes with one of the people who was watching

00:29:56.02 that would be awesome oh yeah my bike's purple now didn't you it would used to

00:29:59.10 be black [Laughter]

00:30:02.04 do you think Gavin that any of the people that observed Geoff doing this

00:30:06.14 could describe it better than Geoff did or would it be equally confusing if we

00:30:10.09 were I think they could describe it better because I asked Geoff I said to

00:30:14.05 Geoff that I didn't understand it he explained it again in the exact same way

00:30:18.23 my brain immediately fills with like a Jackie

00:30:21.19 chan stunt like Geoff starts it and I just imagined it's Jackie chan and it

00:30:26.23 kind of makes sense in my head man Jackie chan is coming for Keenan and

00:30:30.14 cow in most mentions oh yeah have you I never looked at that

00:30:34.15 I thought there was a list is it Keenan and kel have the most mentions oh is

00:30:38.01 there a list what's the list I think somebody there was like it was on the

00:30:43.09 face subreddit I saw like a celebrity mentions yeah I thought you mentioned it

00:30:49.12 in that context I did too that's why I'm you uh coincidentally mentioned

00:30:54.04 there are some people who come up all the time and I just thought it's

00:30:57.10 probably Keenan and kello to this point but you didn't there was literally like

00:31:01.17 a list that was posted a day before that

00:31:04.04 was that premise before you said it so I just assumed that you had looked at the

00:31:07.19 list no yeah I don't use Reddit where is this I want to see it

00:31:13.01 I've been taking what you said as fact it's like researched fact not just that

00:31:18.05 your gut like yeah that's wild I was instantly happy that you clicked on that

00:31:22.05 list and you could answer questions for us because I hadn't had a chance to yet

00:31:26.13 that's incredible.

00:31:28.11 [Applause]

00:37:06.04 before we pivot Gavin what type would you

00:37:10.02 would you identify the big bad wolf as a werewolf the big bad wolf from red

00:37:14.21 riding hood red riding hood yeah what do you think of them as a werewolf I just

00:37:19.09 thought it was a wolf you did okay well that's that's less I was playing the

00:37:23.12 family feud game and the question was things the wolf wouldn't want to find in

00:37:28.01 the basket and I put silver bullets and I thought it was absurd that that was

00:37:32.08 not on the board and it then turned into a realization that I've just assumed it

00:37:37.09 was a werewolf but it was this entire time yeah that because

00:37:40.13 Geoff brought up a great point it talks so I've just kind of assumed I feel like

00:37:44.12 that the wolf and the big bad wolf does not feel just like a big bad wolf feels

00:37:49.18 like a werewolf dude it talks it stands on two feet and it dresses up in clothes

00:37:53.16 and [ __ ] that is that is 100 werewolf behavior and I completely support you in

00:37:58.23 this I just thought it was an anthropomorphic wolf I just I've always

00:38:02.22 thought werewolf it's wild to me that anyone would think otherwise for that

00:38:07.05 all right yes that makes sense Eric is with Gavin uh

00:38:10.17 I mean I get that it's a normal wolf but I can I completely can understand what

00:38:15.09 where Andrew would get werewolf because the distinction is like I mean and to be

00:38:19.17 honest who knows if there's a prequel uh to the story that's true that

00:38:23.21 explains that it is a world but but so it sounds like we're 2-2 so I would love

00:38:27.13 to oh never mind nick answered normal talking wolf all right well you and I

00:38:31.18 are on the losing side of this one yeah what if what if skyrim dlc was like

00:38:36.19 a prequel to red riding hood [Laughter]

00:38:41.14 I was the dlc vampire I think werewolf were in the base game

00:38:45.11 I don't know I never I never played those guys never got in didn't play

00:38:48.14 skyrim I played it a little bit I I just I don't know the scene the like the

00:38:52.09 setting of it didn't didn't appeal to me at that time I'm sure if I revisited it

00:38:57.18 I'd have a lot more fun too cold too yeah why the same with fallout 3

00:39:01.16 I walked out of the vault and I was like holy [ __ ] this is there's a lot to do

00:39:06.10 here I can do any of it I don't want to do any of it because it's too big and

00:39:10.00 then I just didn't play it again for like a year and a half and then I

00:39:13.02 eventually gave it another try and I enjoyed it a lot I fell in love with

00:39:16.06 that game but I was so overwhelmed by the open world of it oh it's great I

00:39:20.03 just don't the setting of skyrim wasn't appealing to me so it just it didn't it

00:39:24.14 was overwhelming and I didn't really like the design of the world initially

00:39:28.11 so I never got sucked into it but I'm sure as I said if I revisited it I'd

00:39:32.02 have a lot of fun I mean it looks a lot better now than it did then as well so

00:39:36.00 maybe you'll just enjoy it more yeah maybe I feel like it's the game that I

00:39:39.03 started and and walked away from the most in my

00:39:42.01 life like I've probably played the first 10 hours of that game 15 times you're

00:39:45.20 like oh I'm gonna play it I'm gonna go through it this time and you get into

00:39:47.18 like yeah this is fun I remember how to play it and then you set it down and you

00:39:50.23 come back like a week later and you're like how do these controls work I gotta

00:39:54.15 start over again god damn it yeah inventory games are hard to get

00:39:56.02 back to because you don't you have to you spend like the first hour looking

00:39:59.20 through your own pockets trying to remember where you got [ __ ] and what you

00:40:03.16 were doing with it yeah that's I fell off of elden ring I didn't play it for

00:40:06.21 like three days in a row so that's it's impossible to play

00:40:09.22 three days that was it yeah I was like oh that's back to jim's a war Andrew I

00:40:14.12 have a question for you okay um when you

00:40:17.05 fell asleep in the bath for six hours uh was was your back wet um

00:40:21.05 because sometimes you had that problem with the seal where it like you damn it

00:40:25.20 no no it was largely dry I would say I was sitting upright as this is a very

00:40:29.22 snug I snuggly put in this is a little tight little squeeze it was good what if

00:40:35.18 you drowned no I don't I I physically couldn't for how the tub is and how I sit

00:40:41.01 I'm telling you it could not physically happen

00:40:44.14 it's an impossibility that it would happen I bet we could drown you I I you

00:40:50.07 could drown me I could not drown myself for how I fall asleep in that tub

00:40:56.00 could not happen I've slept I have a long history of taking little naps and

00:41:01.14 tubs there are some dangerous ones for sure place to sleep oh it's just so

00:41:07.01 relaxing though I mean Gavin you talk about how it's hard to

00:41:10.04 visualize me falling uh my bike falling out from under me I have trouble

00:41:15.05 understanding how Andrew is like maintaining a seal sitting up falling

00:41:18.20 asleep getting pickled toes yeah and shoving four shampoo bottles up his

00:41:23.16 [ __ ] all at the same time that four was it was one it was it was

00:41:28.04 about the size of four I'll give you that I couldn't do four I think I could

00:41:33.05 genuinely normal-size I'oreal bottles two and a

00:41:36.08 half I think you could fit the I'oreal ball in your ass oh I could without a

00:41:41.08 doubt a hundred percent just by itself yes absolutely because you're worth it

00:41:45.20 ah see see you did there that the joke book do you still have your book

00:41:50.12 I sure do I wish I knew where it was or else I'd read it I tell you some great

00:41:54.20 joke that makes no sense we should have one one joke from that book a year I

00:41:58.09 think that one a year what would be the joke day what would be

00:42:02.05 the thing that like oh it's joke moment dude I feel like that has to be an event

00:42:07.12 like every certain episode per year what about after every redemption

00:42:10.23 after every redemption year are we saying there's multiple redemption years

00:42:15.01 well every individual redemption well there has to be multiple redemption

00:42:16.23 years ago yeah because you've not redeemed yourself on all the stuff that

00:42:20.02 you were supposed to do this year because you didn't get it all done in

00:42:23.09 the redemption year so we've got to have an extension and if I keep doing things

00:42:26.21 like Greg and accounting I'm going to have constantly new things to redeem for

00:42:31.03 like the list will just continue to build I'm not gonna run out of things that

00:42:36.21 require redemption based on my history with this show unfortunate unfortunately

00:42:41.04 I agree with him

00:42:44.00 do you think do you think if we I may be designing in my head right now

00:42:49.12 on a product for one but wouldn't it be cool if we had a sign that said like

00:42:56.21 uh a blank number of days since your bike wreck and I could fill it in and I

00:43:01.22 could add it up every day and then I could be like oh I made it like 105 days

00:43:06.05 before my next bike rack you've just designed our third sign

00:43:10.21 but it's very very it's a very niche market

00:43:13.20 and probably just for people who wreck on their bicycle maybe it doesn't have

00:43:17.19 to be bicycle I could just say like x number of days since last wreck I

00:43:21.02 thought that you were talking about for you specifically as a thing that is well

00:43:25.05 I would like a large extent no but for you yes I think that is

00:43:29.08 entertaining the only way I can get stuff made for me is by

00:43:33.09 tricking you guys into thinking it's a it's a worthwhile product for the

00:43:36.19 company which by the way I'd like to point out uh I don't know if you guys

00:43:40.13 have seen jackass 4.5 yet have either of these yes I have uh totally

00:43:45.12 this blade for andrew's blank days without salad creaming is [ __ ]

00:43:50.17 awesome and just an erasable marker uh [ __ ]

00:43:53.19 I feel so goddamn vindicated Gavin for the spicy icy there is a bit

00:43:58.12 they do in jackass 4.5 where they all put funnels in their [ __ ] and they

00:44:04.02 pour hot sauce in it so they all like ram hot sauce up their [ __ ] and good

00:44:09.14 Steve has that sauce doesn't he feel it yeah it is totally sauce

00:44:14.00 it's we man sauce uh and so uh then uh to deal with the pain johnny Knoxville

00:44:20.08 hands out uh popsicles and they all shove popsicles up their ass and they

00:44:25.09 all feel instantly better so it worked it absolutely worked but

00:44:29.22 imagine and that's just a Popsicle that's just sugar water imagine imagine

00:44:35.08 like the soothing latching as a soothing milky Popsicle be way better it's good

00:44:41.02 for your skin good for your anal skin well maybe Andrea could try it after he's

00:44:45.11 had all that shampoo held up there fella well it's there's no spot I don't know

00:44:48.16 if you know what a shampoo bottle is they're not spicy I've never had it it

00:44:53.05 might give you irritation no I'm not probably not great to have shampoo in your

00:44:57.17 crap no it's definitely not the clench was not great it was a serious clinch I

00:45:02.12 would have the things would have broken in that clinch it was like a vice it's

00:45:06.08 like the scene in [ __ ] casino where they they squeezed the guy's head that

00:45:10.17 was tight I could be a von b avon wow [ __ ] that up

00:45:15.05 never mind we're just gonna move on vond I said Vaughn

00:45:20.12 yeah I was so excited to say villain that Vaughn came out instead of bond and

00:45:24.14 now we could just move on because wasn't even that great of a joke to begin with

00:45:28.08 well what could you crush what could you destroy in your ass like

00:45:31.12 definitely the first

00:45:36.10 define destroy uh it goes in good it comes out bad it goes in red no

00:45:42.10 it goes in normal and comes out right like imagine a bread stick right you

00:45:47.08 couldn't eat it after you crushed it in your ass so it would be like step one

00:45:52.09 okay I mean I it would still be edible just you wouldn't want to what about the

00:45:57.03 problem with my example what about like like those uh you know those like

00:46:01.14 Christmas poppers where you pull up both ends and like oh

00:46:04.17 do you think you could put one in your butt and then the other and then gavin's

00:46:09.05 butt and you guys could together like pull it

00:46:11.14 let's see we could do anal tug of war we

00:46:14.06 could if we did as to ass with Christmas crackers I am completely convinced that

00:46:18.23 we will see we'll see who wins the little set of

00:46:21.16 screwdrivers the paper hat and the joke me or Andrews

00:46:26.15 you win the anal crown uh you weren't here for this Andrew but

00:46:31.05 this this goes perfectly into anal Olympics we were talking earlier about

00:46:34.12 shoving shampoo bottles up our butts and seeing who can walk with them the

00:46:37.12 farthest before you drop it we could be they could be a whole series of events

00:46:42.05 wait that was the conversation you had while you were spilling your while you

00:46:46.00 were dropping your oh I see I thought you meant earlier in the day you happen

00:46:49.21 to be talking about this anal olympic prep yeah no Gavin and I were browsing

00:46:54.08 Reddit and we were reading threads about

00:46:56.06 yeah anal stuff and okay yeah no I could

00:46:59.05 what else would be an anal event for the anal Olympics

00:47:03.09 anal taste test been talking about that for years anal taste test yeah

00:47:07.22 well what does that is it like you the person who's most accurate wins how do

00:47:13.07 you meddle in that yeah or maybe maybe you could do like uh like

00:47:18.08 you have like a like you do the the the shampoo bottle is a distance thing but

00:47:22.14 then maybe you have like a bunch of like I don't know like little baseballs or

00:47:26.01 something and you have to like pick up as many as you can and then drop them

00:47:29.17 over in another bucket and then you have like a minute and whoever can move the

00:47:33.11 most baseballs or apples move the most apples ass apples apples

00:47:38.00 are good what I like about the shampoo bottle is it has the length to turn it

00:47:42.18 into a relay race which I think would be really funny if you can pass off the

00:47:46.15 anal bottle ass to add 100100

00:47:48.23 we talked about that idea of bobbing for apples at Halloween which I still want

00:47:52.21 to do I think it's great but you could also you could anal bob for apples like

00:47:58.02 stick your butt in a in a barrel and try to come up with a with a with app

00:48:02.07 I think it's a tough one to pull off well the Olympics are not for the

00:48:07.14 it's the best in the world Andrew that's fair

00:48:10.01 and we could introduce this would be great you have to walk through the anal

00:48:13.18 passage for the opening ceremony [Laughter]

00:48:17.12 this is so stupid do you do you think you could at la not even

00:48:22.07 could do you think you are the best in the world at anything right now do I

00:48:26.13 think I'm the best in the world and almost certainly something let me think

00:48:30.14 something right there's got to be one thing you do that nobody else does as

00:48:34.11 well as you honor the confidence I thought he was going to say almost

00:48:37.21 certainly not and he said something like he thinks he's the best

00:48:41.12 in the entire world but can't even pinpoint it one thing well I just feel

00:48:46.19 statistic I feel the same like aliens in outer space statistically probably I'd

00:48:51.00 assume a lot of space up there I can do a lot of things

00:48:54.09 things that I can't even think of necessarily off the top of my head I'm

00:48:58.21 sure I'm the best at one of them some strangely the best of anyone alive

00:49:03.14 yeah but like how do you could I be super specific in the wording and be

00:49:08.21 like the best at holding a controller in a certain way without

00:49:13.10 realizing it's a technique like how small of an accomplishment are we right

00:49:17.01 but like on a Wednesday if it's cloudy right like yeah you can whittle it down

00:49:20.05 to that but no I just like something that you do that you think you like

00:49:23.16 there was a time uh when I I I know it's not true I

00:49:27.07 understand it's not true but there was a

00:49:29.15 time when I felt like I was probably the best pedal player on earth sure I had

00:49:35.09 pedal confidence right uh there was a time when I considered

00:49:38.09 myself once again totally not true but I had I had machinima confidence and I

00:49:42.03 felt like I was probably the best machinimator on earth which is a weird

00:49:45.12 thing because I was like maybe I was but

00:49:47.06 only because nobody else gave a [ __ ] to try yes right

00:49:50.01 but still like there there's got to be something that Gavin is the very best

00:49:54.15 like he's probably the best high-speed photographer of a certain

00:49:58.03 like people getting hit in the face with soccer balls there's like nobody better

00:50:01.09 at capturing that than gathering you'd really have to narrow it down for a

00:50:05.05 unique set of experiences best high-speed photographer

00:50:09.04 who wears a lab coat while filming I but my confidence is weird so like

00:50:14.06 if I'm looking at a raffle that has not a lot of entrance in it or

00:50:19.08 like bingo bingo is a better example every bingo game I go into I have an

00:50:23.23 internal feeling of there's no [ __ ]

00:50:25.16 way I'm gonna lose this even though it's completely out of my control I think

00:50:30.02 we've talked about this before with horse racing I would never bet on a

00:50:33.18 horse race by myself because I'd have zero confidence in my ability to ever

00:50:37.12 pick a correct horse and that's like a one and seven or whatever I just would

00:50:41.11 never believe that I could do it but you could put me in a raffle of 25000 and

00:50:45.11 I'd look at it and be like I'm feeling good about this I don't see how I lose

00:50:49.12 you have bingo confidence that's a great thing to have dude I'm two for two at

00:50:54.21 picking the right box in uh survivor do or die oh really oh you do that oh I am

00:51:00.06 I know even got him back you you might be the best person in the world at that

00:51:05.20 that's when I made the correct one in three choice twice

00:51:10.08 I love that they added that gimmick and the last shot and the dark so it's like

00:51:15.11 they added two new gimmicks to survivor just to be brief on it that are like

00:51:19.03 whoa somebody could save themselves if they pull a one and six or in a scenario

00:51:23.16 in which you have to open one of three boxes two of them will send you home one

00:51:27.15 will one will keep you safe neither of their twists I felt like worked

00:51:31.12 nobody has ever been saved by a shot in the dark and both times they did the

00:51:35.14 three boxes it's clearly tilted in a way that they want them to be eliminated

00:51:39.10 they both were just fine like they added these new things and they had zero

00:51:43.18 impact on how they wanted them to they were still good moments so

00:51:47.00 this has been a phenomenal season I've loved this season of survivor great

00:51:51.05 season who do you want to win I this is like an interesting thing about

00:51:56.09 this season there's nobody I really would be upset with if they won

00:52:00.02 outside of like romeo and it's not even personal I just he hasn't they haven't

00:52:03.19 shown him do a lot everybody else would be fine romeo seems kind of weasely I

00:52:08.10 I'm not crazy for him but I I agree with you I like if Jonathan won that'd be

00:52:11.23 great I think I want marianne to win yeah but I wouldn't I wouldn't mind if I

00:52:15.16 agree pretty much any of them won can I tell you my dream scenario for the

00:52:17.18 finale on Wednesday so by the time people hear this they will know if this

00:52:22.02 happened or not but I've been anticipating this for weeks I so badly

00:52:25.23 want because the last challenge in survivor is a fire making challenge and

00:52:30.05 whoever wins makes it to the end whoever

00:52:33.01 loses goes home there's no more votes at that point

00:52:35.07 I so badly want it to be mike and Jonathan and fire just to hear mike be

00:52:40.02 like couple of titans going at it I don't want it any other way like a

00:52:44.15 couple of big guys yeah the way he compares it and also the beautiful irony

00:52:48.23 of if mike the firefighter goes home because of his inability to make fire I

00:52:53.04 just think it would be so great his commentary on his match up and him going

00:52:57.02 up home due to his inability to make fire as a firefighter wonderful that's

00:53:01.08 what I hope that is that is that that would be pretty spectacular that'd be

00:53:04.20 great that'd be great tv I think I think we should all well I hate to give us

00:53:08.17 homework and you guys can ignore it too because I'm not your future but I feel

00:53:12.10 like we should all think about what we're the best in the world at maybe we

00:53:15.20 should maybe that's an angle we should take with the podcast like

00:53:18.18 let's find our our hidden talents and let's celebrate them right like eric's

00:53:22.22 the best in the world at something nick is the best in the world at something so

00:53:26.13 let's I wanna I wanna I wanna celebrate in that that's guys Eric might be the

00:53:30.00 best in the world at translating how he really feels into a polite email very

00:53:36.13 he's pretty good at that he's pretty good somebody's gotta do it because

00:53:41.07 that's the only way anything's gonna get done I also need to I I realize I'm I

00:53:46.04 can't even say I'm the best high speed photographer who has lab coat because a

00:53:49.10 lot of them are used in real labs

00:53:51.20 [ __ ]

00:53:52.21 Yeah I gotta think about what I could possibly be the best at I like that

00:53:57.07 maybe next episode we record we could we will submit our beliefs on what we're

00:54:02.01 the best at if you're I mean if you remember it's also yeah

00:54:05.18 for sure I think that'd be fun we could also be like uh you guys like

00:54:10.10 it could be like when Gavin was supposed to draw a gurpler oh yeah

00:54:17.16 hey I can I can contribute to the redemption here right yeah of course

00:54:23.03 so should we come up with our own things

00:54:25.05 that we think we're best at or should we come up with us plus the other two I

00:54:30.08 think that's fine I think both yeah I think both is funny

00:54:33.02 I want to hear what you think I would be the best at I think that'd be funny uh

00:54:38.23 not in this moment eyes bigger than their stomach confidence

00:54:43.16 yeah you might you might be the best person at being confidently wrong

00:54:48.19 in your own abilities on earth you're confident in a way that defies

00:54:52.16 physics and reason

00:54:57.09 that's fair I can't argue that what if you actually had the most

00:55:02.13 unbreakable notes I think I do that's a great great one to think of I think my

00:55:07.20 nose is very unbreakable it just says what seven and a half billion people on

00:55:13.11 earth yeah best knows well okay there have to be some

00:55:17.05 clarifications I think it has to be some people I don't know

00:55:21.06 there's some scenarios in which I may not have the I think I do but there's

00:55:25.05 some scenarios I could see hey speaking of the gurpler I wasn't able to make the

00:55:29.10 merch meeting the last couple weeks uh is that still getting made yeah we

00:55:32.23 completely forgot to talk about it I thought about that yesterday it's like

00:55:36.19 that was that was the one thing that we uh we didn't mention are the most which

00:55:40.14 means anything like pleasantries or they just straight to business they're

00:55:43.22 straight the business they're straight to business but it's good business yeah

00:55:48.02 okay I will say Eric almost accidentally

00:55:50.09 ordered you 300 more baseballs Geoff that was fine oh my god I have like I still

00:55:53.19 have I have four boxes of baseballs in my

00:55:56.07 house we should probably hit this yeah I got him you didn't [ __ ] tell us so I

00:56:00.12 just said yeah we need to order those baseballs so we can go hit the baseballs

00:56:03.05 well yeah but I got him right as I was going out of town so I couldn't have

00:56:06.13 done anything and you texted us after you did that yeah

00:56:10.21 well I thought so I did tell you no if we had to get it out of you but I

00:56:15.14 told you no we had to ask you that's not how this

00:56:19.14 works but you asked me and then I told you no because I told Mallory we need to

00:56:23.04 order those baseballs and she went oh more and I said yeah so we can hit more

00:56:26.22 and then it was a whole runaround of like oh no Geoff has them and yeah I do I

00:56:31.13 do have them I have this one more ordered on top of the more oh there was

00:56:35.10 just one more okay no it was close so I was I remember them being ordered

00:56:40.04 in the last meeting and I heard the miscommunication between Eric and

00:56:44.07 Mallory and I was very quiet I was very quiet as as excited about the

00:56:48.04 possibility of Eric ordering a whole other set of Geoff how funny would that

00:56:52.08 be though and then that would itself been pretty funny it would have been

00:56:55.20 funny but you would have died you would have literally oh we could have done

00:56:59.05 something different with those balls we got to come up with something clever and

00:57:02.13 new to do with those balls I uh oh man oh man Andrew I don't think you were

00:57:06.12 there I think we came up with this idea on the boat when we all went uh we went

00:57:10.08 to eric's birthday party his water adjacent birthday party uh

00:57:14.16 Gavin had the idea that we should make a

00:57:17.15 boot that has a vck soul on it just like the logo and then like Stan stand and

00:57:22.22 paint and then make our own like one-of-a-kind posters where you just

00:57:26.11 like step on on the poster and it makes like a [ __ ]

00:57:29.21 print originally I thought that that would be a really funny signature if

00:57:33.22 Andrew had to kick his signature onto people yeah

00:57:37.10 I was like maybe we should have him kick

00:57:39.11 posters yeah it's just a big gap for you to for you to sign stuff with your boot

00:57:44.01 kick I don't feel like posters are kick able I think that's an interesting

00:57:47.17 product that you choose to go you could just stand well you like hang it on a

00:57:51.03 bit of wood and then you kick it and then you take the poster away and then

00:57:54.23 someone else comes by and puts their poster there and wham yeah okay I like

00:57:59.18 it this is great do you think you could kick 500 posters no absolutely not

00:58:04.14 oh my god of course you couldn't you know I could kick a

00:58:07.16 thousand posters of course you could [Music]

00:58:10.17 like look we're giving it to the guy who rolls his

00:58:14.19 ankle every time he sets foot in Austin and now we're oh yeah that's true that's

00:58:20.17 true that's a lot of baths for you I don't know I couldn't kick 500 without

00:58:24.18 being dead afterwards like just everything being soared now what if we

00:58:29.22 laid you on a bed and all you had to do was extend your leg

00:58:34.04 what if okay I've got a premise for you what if we somehow made them

00:58:37.13 the conveyor like the the part on a treadmill that goes in a circle and I

00:58:43.03 just run on the treadmill as they rapidly rotate

00:58:46.19 that's a great idea you just need somebody to feed it at the top of the

00:58:49.17 treadmill and then somebody to pull it off at the back we can totally do that

00:58:54.10 oh that's a great idea Andrew hey uh Eric we need a treadmill a bigger we

00:58:59.15 haven't do we have a talk about it to be as long as possible

00:59:03.07 I okay I can see what I can find I don't know thank you

00:59:06.08 I failed rtx booth ideas well we're talking about the tea towels oh were

00:59:09.17 they were they failed I like those I don't know which ones we're doing or not

00:59:13.01 I think we're gonna do them aren't we are we gonna do I don't know I hope we

00:59:14.15 shouldn't talk about them we have some rtx ideas for our because you know

00:59:18.08 they'll be uh I think they've cancelled all that

00:59:20.19 because we didn't get back to them in time oh well we're gonna do something I

00:59:24.19 assume uh at rtx which is the big rooster teeth

00:59:28.01 convention in Austin Texas every year I think it's July 1st to 3rd this year

00:59:33.06 there will be some sort of an uh face booth

00:59:37.04 on the show floor and we had a bunch of clever ideas

00:59:41.03 uh I don't know which one we're gonna do one of them was we were gonna have a

00:59:44.21 wall of ian's and people could come up and draw their own ian and then Gavin

00:59:48.08 wanted to make tea towels over them because I just explained that there's a

00:59:52.02 that's a I'm not sure if it's still done if you let me know if

00:59:55.18 you've just come out of English primary school

00:59:58.12 they would go around the school and get everyone to draw themselves on a post-it

01:00:02.21 note and then write their name under it and then they would print the entire

01:00:06.17 school's post-it note portraits on a tea towel

01:00:09.22 and give it to the parents so you'd have like all of the cloth like year two and

01:00:13.14 it'd be like pieces of [ __ ] drawings because I can't draw and as it goes up

01:00:17.01 in years like the drawings get a bit better and I think my tea towel was from

01:00:20.08 when I was in year two so it's a real piece of [ __ ] but yeah you'd have

01:00:25.01 everyone you know everyone in the school little self portraits and it'd be

01:00:28.19 amazingly niche to have a an ian's tea towel

01:00:32.11 I love it yeah it's a great idea we talked about recreating andrew's bedroom

01:00:36.18 on the floor so people can walk around and take pictures on the on the pillow

01:00:40.12 mountains one to one scale yeah we talked about uh we talked about uh

01:00:44.14 putting out the the uh the port a potty and just letting people sign the outside

01:00:47.19 of it which we could maybe still do we also talked about like recording like a

01:00:50.23 90 second episode and then having it play on loop in the port a potty and you

01:00:54.09 could go in and sit and listen to it for like 60 seconds and get up and let

01:00:57.22 somebody else come sit in it was a nightmare for Trevor who is I

01:01:01.06 suppose being told to get ideas out of us he would like slack us and we'd come

01:01:04.18 up with ideas and then the day late it'd be like all right so which idea are we

01:01:08.19 doing we would just submit like three brand new yeah

01:01:11.13 one one thing I wanted to do was I wanted to have a big wall I wanted to

01:01:15.04 call it the wall of a thousand ian's uh this is where the tea towel idea came I

01:01:18.11 don't know they kind of fed off each other but yeah I wanted on that and it was

01:01:23.09 broken into segment or it's like segmented out into the size of baseball

01:01:26.17 cards essentially like a grid and then everybody comes and they draw their own

01:01:30.02 ian and then at the end of rtx I cut up all thousand and I we have a thousand

01:01:34.21 one of one individual ian art cards that

01:01:37.09 then I can give away during break [ __ ]

01:01:39.12 or like throw it in with extra merch like we did with when we threw cards in

01:01:44.04 with the uh with the wrist pocket for instance

01:01:46.10 which uh which by the way uh I I was in Orlando last week at the anal passage

01:01:50.15 show and I know we're not going to talk about

01:01:52.23 anal passage but I was there at the end of passage show and uh three people came

01:01:57.18 up to me in bald jack shirts and six people had anal passage shirts which

01:02:02.12 yes was more people than had the annual pass shirt uh of the same design uh but

01:02:08.08 the dude who did the the uh the wrist pocket unboxing

01:02:13.07 remember that guy yeah yeah he was there and I talked to him he was awesome

01:02:16.13 awesome and he brought his wrist pocket so I got to see it

01:02:20.19 where was this event it was in Orlando but like was it like a what was the

01:02:25.12 venue that was a place called the vanguard theater okay it you know do you

01:02:29.13 know um this isn't gonna help for anybody uh who's not Gavin or for

01:02:33.12 anybody who wasn't at the show but do you remember the venue in la when we did

01:02:37.18 h when we did the ah tour this year yeah it was like a it looked just like that

01:02:41.16 place like a bar at the back and all that yeah it felt like the exact same it

01:02:44.19 felt like I was in the same building and people would voluntarily wear an anal

01:02:49.07 passage shirt to that there were probably 125 people there and I would say uh

01:02:54.03 most of them mentioned anal passage to me but at least

01:02:58.08 at least 10 of them were in uh face gear and I think I think I saw

01:03:01.20 six anal passage shirts yeah I can't wait to get mine I still don't have one

01:03:05.20 oh really really do you have one I thought about wearing it okay I'll I'll

01:03:10.12 I'll check into that for you that's weird let's never get any of it I've

01:03:14.13 known we also months we also found out that all of the merch goes to rt and is

01:03:18.22 in the mail room and Gavin just never goes to check yeah she's probably

01:03:21.20 waiting for you there with all the other things that's right yeah yeah yeah yeah

01:03:25.12 that's what it is okay thank you yeah no problem I went there and all of the

01:03:30.13 merch for me was gone there was like some dregs but apparently

01:03:34.09 all my stuff was taken by someone Sarah weems was very unhappy about it

01:03:39.11 well that's where somebody well somebody's wearing your anal passage

01:03:44.00 sure right now then somebody in rt uh I guess we should probably stop talking

01:03:49.18 to each other for another week yeah well we're gone next week right

01:03:53.14 we're taking a one-week break so two weeks from now I believe we'll be back
