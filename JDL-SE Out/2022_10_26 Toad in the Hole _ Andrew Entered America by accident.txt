00:01:07.18 First uh first episode of season five apparently oh yeah what a great way to.

00:01:13.12 End season four my own death oh my Lord Andrew I gotta say man that was uh I

00:01:19.23 hope you never change that was the most entertaining 25 minutes of my life maybe

00:01:26.11 I'm an innocent man uh take the most boring part of the well he

00:01:32.01 he had the easiest part and somehow came off as the best part of that challenge

00:01:36.16 which was incredible it's phenomenal you know what blew me away the most what

00:01:40.13 blew you away the most we went an entire episode without mentioning extra medium

00:01:44.22 why do you do that move on I almost made a reference to it

00:01:48.16 accidentally and I was like don't want to do that let's step away from that

00:01:53.18 oh hey speaking of making references to [ __ ] that uh has come up a lot lately

00:01:59.08 should we talk about why we pushed the monkey movie again oh yeah I think this

00:02:03.23 is the last time we should mention if it gets pushed because we've been

00:02:07.11 ridiculous I was saying to Nick earlier I wonder if we took every moment of us

00:02:11.19 scheduling it that we've recorded how much how much is that footage how long

00:02:15.23 is is there an episode is there a full episode worth of us discussing the

00:02:20.16 scheduling of MVP too because it was supposed to what what date did Nick say

00:02:24.23 the first one was like March 18th Jesus was the date uh the

00:02:29.12 initial recording date for monkey movie 2 March 18th I mean that sounds good to

00:02:35.10 me dude I don't think you can commit to March 18th next year if I thought if I

00:02:40.08 thought that if I thought we could submit that date and we would do it it

00:02:43.21 would be worth it to me because we're not going to film until then anyway just

00:02:47.03 based on how this is going but I don't trust that if we if we set it in stone.

00:02:51.14 March 18th I'm there's like an 80 chance you won't be here at least so it's my

00:02:56.07 fault again I won but it was sort of I it was

00:03:00.01 expected I felt like the last time we recorded you gave off a tone that was

00:03:03.14 like it's probably gonna get moved but you just don't want to say it yeah well

00:03:07.01 I was juggling the uh the rental days of a camera being available the Quarry

00:03:11.15 being available and when Dan was in and it just came to uh everything's only

00:03:17.05 gonna line up tomorrow which is when we're gonna no to totally yeah

00:03:20.15 understood it gives me more time to prevent wow did I say person next what

00:03:25.18 did I say that was a [ __ ] horrible combination of words trying to be

00:03:29.01 perfect it allows me more time to work on the banana wipe that's probably my

00:03:33.14 favorite flip a perfect neck perfect that was so funny

00:03:38.07 to me it's Dino it's so bad typically when you flub you could see like the

00:03:43.07 person was thinking between two different words and they kind of got

00:03:46.12 mixed they didn't know what to go with perfect is nothing there's just nothing

00:03:51.06 this is wrong that's just a Miss I was uh I was doing another podcast uh with

00:03:54.23 Jack this morning super fan Jack uh who by the way made a face appearance uh we

00:03:59.13 should probably mentioned uh but uh oh really yeah I'll tell you about a second

00:04:02.22 anyway we were doing the uh one of the other podcasts with him this morning

00:04:06.12 that's a busy podcast today this is my fourth podcast today but uh he he

00:04:11.00 mispronounced enthusiasm enthusium and didn't know it just kept going I stopped

00:04:16.11 the podcast I was like I held my hand I was like we gotta stop it sounds like a

00:04:21.09 really acknowledge able room yeah that you said enthusium and he was

00:04:26.03 like oh what dude it was [ __ ] awesome oh I've uh just

00:04:30.03 for when we if we ever have time uh I've plopped a little video in the slack

00:04:34.00 channel oh you did well that's exciting I'll be honest I really don't have any

00:04:37.18 things for this episode So you you're right ahead yeah why don't you will hit

00:04:43.13 hit play on on three maybe okay well I already hit play kid you want to sit up

00:04:49.23 Geoff one two three okay here we go Bobby if um

00:04:53.04 if if you are someone what size shirt they needed

00:04:57.07 I asked someone what size shirt yeah yeah and they said extra medium [Music]

00:05:03.09 yeah what size shirt would you bring them [Music]

00:05:13.15 just yeah and you wouldn't bring them a large no

00:05:18.19 let's bring them a medium yeah I think they're over Muppet why

00:05:25.12 I've seen the video I feel like my video proves more than

00:05:30.04 what gavage has posted my real video confirms more I don't know Dan thinks

00:05:35.23 that that should be a sustain's opinion I don't know I don't understand what

00:05:39.03 you're trying to do you've already won anyone else's opinion I just thought

00:05:42.16 that was an interesting one I just asked him randomly and uh

00:05:45.03 how do you also insulted Eric basically at the end which I thought was worth

00:05:48.19 posting that's true the guy you the guy you spend that much time with and have a

00:05:53.06 successful Channel with and livelihood depends on you guys working together you

00:05:57.08 asked him randomly and then he just sort of agreed with you that's pretty crazy

00:06:00.14 yeah I gotta what does that have to do with whether he he's never heard that

00:06:05.01 before what do you mean well you you don't know that at all first of all and

00:06:10.21 secondly uh secondly out of all the people on Earth no offense

00:06:16.10 listening I genuinely love Dan I have an affection for him I've gotten to know

00:06:21.22 him over the last decade or so uh I've seen him grow up and Blossom into the

00:06:26.20 successful man that he is uh I think he's the best I really I genuinely enjoy

00:06:31.21 uh time with him when I get to have it had a great dinner with him earlier this

00:06:35.17 year when we all went to dinner on the windy night uh but if I'm asking

00:06:40.11 anybody's opinion on something that requires um

00:06:44.09 intelligence uh he's he said that he's low he's low on that list

00:06:48.16 like I would probably ask somebody at a gas station first all right fair play

00:06:53.19 I do appreciate it yeah he insulted Eric and that's always fun so I think my

00:06:58.06 muppet yeah that was good that's enjoyable I is that it I don't even know

00:07:02.14 if that is an insult I don't I guess not I would be pretty excited if I was

00:07:05.16 called a muppet I love them that's what yeah that's like saying I thought being

00:07:09.17 chuffed was being mad but apparently it's not I don't like none of this makes

00:07:14.01 sense to me

00:07:16.12 so the times people have been shocked with you you're like wow what's that

00:07:21.22 problem yeah I like people have said that and they just go I mean okay I'm

00:07:26.07 sorry whoops but what does chuffed mean I thought I've been bothered

00:07:30.04 I mean it's really happy yeah it means it means you're stoked on something and

00:07:35.12 it doesn't sound stupid can I ask a random sort of question about uh uh

00:07:40.07 Microsoft Word Microsoft whatever your system is it subscription only for

00:07:45.06 everything no do they only do subscriptions for that stuff do you mean

00:07:48.17 like Microsoft Office yeah like Microsoft Office all this stuff is it

00:07:52.13 subscription only at this stage does anybody use it does anyone try to might

00:07:57.08 be like you could could you go to the store and just buy a license for like

00:08:01.21 the latest version so yeah let me I'll just I'll I'll leave you yesterday

00:08:07.03 I spilled half of a liter of water on my Apple keyboard

00:08:11.02 everything else oh it got all over not really so much CF it was like the bottom

00:08:16.16 right of it it was the right side mainly

00:08:19.16 and then I was like I don't want to deal with this so I just went to bed and I

00:08:24.10 woke up and my keyboard was still wet uh dried it off waited a little bit it

00:08:29.23 was fine everything worked fine until the evening hours later randomly now

00:08:34.21 when I hit Keys other Keys appear than what I want to hit

00:08:39.16 so if I hit the P key it gives me the p and the O and the U and the Y and when I

00:08:44.23 hit delete or backspace it turns my keyboard off

00:08:48.14 my audio buttons are the plus sign and the one below so everything has just

00:08:53.15 been reassigned and I couldn't figure out what was going on so I first I

00:08:58.14 changed the batteries didn't fix it are you saying that you you tried to dry it

00:09:03.11 the next day well it was it was one of those things where I was so tired and I

00:09:08.15 just put water all over my flip it upside down

00:09:11.11 let it drain I could have done listen you're right there are things I could

00:09:15.11 have done I made mistakes in the moment it's very fatigued I just wanted to go

00:09:19.22 to bed I wanted to be quiet as quiet as I possibly could be and I wanted to go

00:09:24.13 to sleep I [ __ I it up I should have put it downwards

00:09:28.03 I did that when I woke up five hours later but those are those are precious

00:09:33.06 five hours and it worked fine as I said it worked fine for like five or six

00:09:37.21 hours and then all of a sudden it just stopped it stopped working maybe next

00:09:42.03 time I'll try to send a message at some point I'll reconnect it I'll try it well

00:09:45.08 it doesn't sound like it stopped working it sounds like it just started working

00:09:49.05 differently that's a better way to put it you just like identify what each key

00:09:53.13 does now and then just paint the new letter or function on top of it so like

00:09:58.04 yeah just re-label the keys thought about that my B and N and M Key no

00:10:02.17 longer work and there are not alternates to the keys

00:10:06.21 that double and anytime I go backwards to remove one of the double keys that I

00:10:12.17 don't want my keyboard turns off for a second

00:10:15.19 it is like the power button has been reassigned to delete backspace button

00:10:21.05 it's a nightmare it doesn't work at all so I thought oh how do I fix this I

00:10:26.15 tried changing the batteries that didn't work I tried rebooting my computer that

00:10:31.06 didn't work I heard updating the OS if you're out of date could potentially

00:10:36.21 solve keyboard issues so I updated my OS everything is fine I go in once the new

00:10:42.14 s is up it says hey your Microsoft Windows is out of date you need to

00:10:46.17 download this app to to get it going so I tried to do that asked for my Apple ID

00:10:51.16 which I haven't used in a long time I guess they've locked me out of my

00:10:55.12 account immediately when I got it wrong had to unlock my account forgot my new

00:11:00.03 password had to change my password again had to go through it was the whole

00:11:04.21 effort I was so mad just everything was complicated everything needed one more

00:11:08.23 step ultimately all this stuff led to me realizing that at least on Mac I don't

00:11:13.11 know if this is the same on Windows stuff Windows runs the subscription you

00:11:17.10 can no longer just buy a disk and get office it would be like eighty dollars a

00:11:22.01 year I'd have to pay 80 a year the only reason why I update is because I spilled

00:11:26.08 water on my keyboard I think I have to pay like seven dollars a month now do

00:11:30.15 you think you could update the water out of your keyboard I just didn't know if

00:11:34.06 it was a sync issue I don't know how anything I was just going through all

00:11:38.17 the steps that could possibly go through couldn't you just use Google Docs

00:11:44.05 potentially I do use Windows for a work specific thing so I wanted to just keep

00:11:48.20 because I know how that works I understand you've got you've got a an

00:11:52.01 architecture you want you like I have a system I have everything laid out a

00:11:55.23 specific way so I think trying to reverse water out of my keyboard by

00:12:00.08 updating my OS is gonna cost me seven dollars a month going forward unless I

00:12:04.04 can find a worker I'm sure the one I was just curious I didn't know if because

00:12:08.12 well I think we're actually Mac users here do you have an Aaron cupboard yeah

00:12:13.06 an errand cupboard

00:12:15.19 airing covered what is an airing cupboard no it's where Enigma is where

00:12:20.14 you put all the stuff you spill war on it's like where the boiler is you keep

00:12:25.16 your towels in there every house it's like stores the hot

00:12:30.14 water for your body you would refer to a towel as a thing you spill water on.

00:12:35.13 [Laughter]

00:12:37.06 It was basically it was nothing wrong but it's a very hot dry cupboard right

00:12:42.20 so it's nice to keep the towels in there

00:12:46.02 they stay all warm you're just using the

00:12:48.01 radiant heat by-product and if you spill on your keyboard you just shove your

00:12:51.20 keyboard in the air in cupboard for a few weeks I'm sure everything you just

00:12:55.06 said is sensible I'm still in processing spilled off Gavin it doesn't it's just

00:12:59.20 such a weird oh I'm getting out of the pool I'll be with you guys in a minute I

00:13:03.06 just gotta go spill off I don't want to get water everywhere what are you

00:13:07.17 talking about is that what I said you said spill I don't think I just don't

00:13:12.15 think we have airing Cupboards in America unfortunately yeah I don't have

00:13:16.21 one in in my house but you know is that a thing like when you so you buy you buy

00:13:21.11 your your house in America do you go look around the house and you're like

00:13:24.18 where the hell is the Airing covered wait a minute does this house not have

00:13:28.18 an airing coverage you just like took it for granted it would be there I got a

00:13:31.23 tank I got tankless heater but in England I had a big freaking ginormous

00:13:36.08 water tank that stored hot water there you go I already posted a picture one

00:13:39.22 and um it would only come on twice a day so if you missed all the hot water in

00:13:43.17 the morning you'd have to either have a cold shower or wait until it came on at

00:13:49.11 like 7 P.M ah that sounds like the Army yeah that sucks we had a bit of a bit of

00:13:53.17 rationing it's also why I think that in the UK the tap the hot and cold tap is

00:13:58.08 separate taps because you can drink the cold water but you can't drink the hot

00:14:04.00 water why is it not potable not not potable

00:14:06.12 really hmm But I know that's a thing people find weird is that if you're

00:14:09.13 trying to wash your hands and you want warm water you have to kind of like move

00:14:13.00 your hand under the hot water and then under the cold one and then you have to

00:14:16.05 just go back and forth to make warm or you just fill the sink

00:14:18.19 oh I don't like that no that doesn't no and you hold countries like that well

00:14:22.22 they're slightly old houses it's like a I think it's like a post-war thing oh

00:14:28.00 okay so like the new houses that they built probably yeah a new house might

00:14:33.03 have uh single Taps and no airing cupboard but I've never lived in one of them

00:14:38.15 hmm wild yeah well what about that Andrew did you put it in your area I

00:14:42.18 didn't I wish I had one I feel like I've seen this in houses though but I just

00:14:47.01 didn't know that there was a specific name for it

00:14:50.18 I feel like I've seen yeah before yeah I'll go with that I've seen uh I've seen

00:14:54.16 people put like shelves around like yeah there's a photo of a hot water heater

00:14:58.18 with some shelves in front of them I've seen people like multi-use

00:15:02.11 uh cupboards where hot water heaters go before I keep I keep the dog food in in

00:15:07.10 uh well I have a tankless one well as well but I keep the where it was is like

00:15:12.12 a HVAC now and I keep the dog food there hmm

00:15:14.18 how far are you Geoff and the the Geoff achievement in gems of War are we close

00:15:18.12 on that uh thanks for asking I am at 66 or 67

00:15:23.11 I'm not sure which you're getting close I'm getting very

00:15:27.10 last time we talked about it was like 40

00:15:30.06 you've made good progress what I'm doing

00:15:33.09 right now is uh other things in the game

00:15:37.03 to boost my character like in-game stuff

00:15:40.08 to to make it easier but also collecting resources I need uh so I could probably

00:15:46.08 be like 72 percent right now if I wanted to but

00:15:50.07 uh I'm just kind of collecting resources and then I'll just do a bunch all at

00:15:54.17 once but yeah thanks I've been I still play every day I'm still working on it

00:15:57.21 actively do you think you'll do the face thing and uh play all the way to 99 and

00:16:03.14 just stop no I'm definitely getting this stupid achievement

00:16:06.23 now who knows if I get if I like I'll get to 98 and the game will shut down or

00:16:11.02 something that could happen that's what I was gonna say have you ever met

00:16:14.19 anybody else that plays Jim's work because you're literally the only person

00:16:18.04 I've ever heard of that plays it I have no I don't know a single person who

00:16:22.03 knows it that'd be like a strange bonding moment for you if you met

00:16:25.19 someone who's equally like the one other it's you two are the ones that are

00:16:29.04 keeping the server going I'm sure it's insanely popular but it's just I've

00:16:32.17 never heard anybody I mean I don't know that it is uh really I think it's I will

00:16:38.14 say I think it's a lot more popular as a mobile and PC game uh yes I think it's

00:16:43.05 less popular as I think it's probably more popular as an Xbox game than a

00:16:46.21 PlayStation game and then there's a switch version that came out not too

00:16:49.19 terribly long ago as well I think nobody plays those but it's definitely more of

00:16:53.07 like a PC Mobile thing how mad would you be Geoff if Andrew beat you to that

00:16:57.23 achievement oh I wouldn't I wouldn't care at all yeah I don't know I'm glad

00:17:01.21 you said that because you could have you

00:17:03.14 could have been really mean and said you would care and then it would become

00:17:07.17 content and then I was hoping you would have activated if you would

00:17:12.00 have been an annoyed but no I can't I can't do that to him that would be like

00:17:16.02 a thousand hours of game play for him to get there I also have been supportive of

00:17:20.09 Geoff and his gems award thing whenever I get a know what the codes do but

00:17:24.01 sometimes I get like a Game Pass here get these free things in gyms of War I

00:17:27.20 was forwarded Geoff yeah you gave me a well before okay I really really

00:17:30.22 appreciate it thank you of course I have no it's the funny thing of I don't I

00:17:34.08 assume these things are useful to you I have no clue what they do or how they

00:17:38.07 work within the game but yeah they're useful in very specific instances but it

00:17:42.07 they're more useful and like if you don't get it now it could take a year to

00:17:46.02 get it again so it's like a lot of it is collecting stuff you may need down the

00:17:50.13 road you know stuff gets re-released into the game in.

00:17:54.04 Cycles so it's like oh [ __ ] I missed that opportunity or that event well well

00:17:57.15 I'll try and get hopefully six months from now it'll show up again

00:18:02.05 it's so fascinating how games like that are profitable and not visible ways like

00:18:06.13 I feel like you don't ever hear conversations about candy crush anymore

00:18:10.13 but that's the game that makes like a billion dollars a year every year still

00:18:16.05 like I wonder I I'm curious I should look into gems of War I would like to

00:18:19.10 know how much money the game best fiends makes because that game has been

00:18:24.23 advertised on every podcast I listen to for three years straight like every best

00:18:30.17 fiends f-i-e-n-b-s means yeah I don't know that we've ever done an

00:18:35.23 advertisement for it maybe we I mean we have Rooster Teeth not uh face but uh uh

00:18:41.16 it's like I hear it on all my like all my celebrity gossip podcasts all a bunch

00:18:46.18 of different kinds and um it's kind of a Candy Crush type game

00:18:51.12 I I played it for like a day I wasn't into it but

00:18:54.02 um yeah I just I I just I imagine their their budget must be tremendous based on

00:18:58.05 how many ads are buying those are great terrible mobile game ads are always

00:19:02.21 fantastic there's so many of them they're just terrible best themes

00:19:07.06 yeah like I was here at advertised on like on Tom seguro podcast and I'm

00:19:11.00 pretty sure those aren't cheap so I wonder how much it would cost to get

00:19:14.14 like a uniform ad on a show if you could put a uniform ad on any show Geoff what

00:19:18.13 would you want it on dude that's actually I'm really glad to hear you say

00:19:22.11 that because I was thinking the other day like how how much would it cost us

00:19:28.03 to just buy enough air time to publish one episode of does it do late at night.

00:19:34.09 I love that right like like yeah yeah on yeah made for TV

00:19:40.05 yeah it's like an infomercial right like how how expensive is that like three in

00:19:45.13 the morning for 15 minutes does it do come it doesn't do episode three comes

00:19:49.13 on so I don't wanna this feels like it could be sausage talk in a sense we've

00:19:53.13 talked about I feel like a natural evolution of does it do is eventually

00:19:57.05 for a product to come out of does it do yeah is that is that the moment you do

00:20:02.17 it or would you rather just like episode one of does it do errors at this random.

00:20:08.02 Channel at 2AM 2 to 215 a.m I mean I think I'm open to all options I think

00:20:11.15 it's more of a like and waiting for the opportunity to present itself in a way

00:20:16.05 that feels right you know what I mean it's like you kind of you kind of you

00:20:19.05 kind of surf the waves of possibility instead of trying to make stuff happen

00:20:22.22 and so I just I feel like I feel like especially with uniform I feel like the

00:20:26.16 the future is pregnant with possibilities and we're just kind of

00:20:29.07 like just kind of see see where things go I get like for instance I think when

00:20:33.15 the switch [ __ ] comes out I think that could be a very funny Tick Tock product

00:20:37.08 you know we're not gonna make enough to sell like that but I I could see a

00:20:41.15 product like that going viral in a funny

00:20:44.10 way on a platform like tick tock I would love to place an ad for uniform just on

00:20:48.01 one of our internal podcasts because I I assume that most of the company doesn't

00:20:52.08 know what that is so we could easily sneak it by him well I did do one for um

00:20:57.01 what was the I'm blanking on the name right now

00:21:00.05 um thank me later I had to thank me later Adam oh right you did too that's

00:21:05.07 true that's true that was brilliant by the way uh I think we should do it I

00:21:10.03 think we should cut some sort of a uniform promo that runs on I mean I

00:21:14.18 guarantee you put it on red web oh no I just had an idea it's great I'm this is

00:21:19.08 I'm happy with this we haven't had it happen many times but in the past we've

00:21:23.17 had requests of like hey this new show is coming out can we run an ad for it on

00:21:28.23 your feed I feel like there needs to be an ad exchange we will gladly allow an

00:21:34.02 ad for another show on our feed in exchange for a potential uniform now

00:21:39.04 that's a good idea did John ever advertise our podcast on his show

00:21:44.20 I think John dislikes me because of your your characterization of what happened

00:21:50.18 I think John might be mad at me let's get him to do a face on his one yeah

00:21:56.04 is this does he still make that what was the name of it no toad of the holes of

00:22:00.17 it was it [Music]

00:22:02.08 that's not real cannon that was it is I don't think so I don't think so I

00:22:08.12 enjoyed it so I had it even worse

00:22:13.05 do we now need to make a toad in the whole podcast get ready for a

00:22:17.17 supplemental toad in the hole coming your way dude toad in the holes to just

00:22:22.23 be it'd just be Gavin talking to British people about British [ __ ]

00:22:26.06 like that's that's your that's the gab Dan podcast uh I mean if anything it's

00:22:31.01 that's an offshoot of sausage talk because there is a sausage in turn in

00:22:34.16 the hole that is true that is true uh that's a great point I do think that's a

00:22:38.05 really that is a really funny way though because you're right we always get like

00:22:41.22 hey somebody else in our periphery in our ad network is like looking to trade

00:22:46.08 ads is anybody in the network uh amenable to it and I always raise my

00:22:50.09 hand and go like faces and then I never hear any word uh uh spoken together like

00:22:54.19 if they're if they'll do if they'll run an app for Face we'll run it out for

00:22:58.11 theirs and then it's like crickets so maybe maybe I could get away with a

00:23:01.15 uniform I think that would work I think it's worth it I think it's great what we

00:23:05.21 should do too is we should get somebody else to do the voice over so it doesn't

00:23:09.19 sound like us right like Nick I feel like I feel like Nick's uh Nick could

00:23:15.13 pull it off or uh yeah right oh Nick said oh oh he he used to do radio ads do

00:23:20.17 you have a radio voice can you do a different absolutely I can just give me

00:23:25.10 something to read here how about uh uniform combining the power of one with

00:23:28.17 the fabric of the farm uniform uniform I'm combining the fabric of one fat

00:23:33.06 combining the fabric of one with the fabricated

00:23:36.07 it's perfect we're gonna get him a script the voice is great

00:23:40.20 I think what he just delivered is perfect for the show

00:23:45.03 I think that's the quality everybody comes to expect talk about legendary flubs.

00:23:50.05 [Laughter]

00:23:52.13 Oh you know what that was a beautiful mind I wish I had the person's name

00:23:57.01 somebody because we talked about when we're pitching ideas for this switch

00:24:00.05 [ __ ] I brought up doing like a baseball version of it somebody was like we

00:24:03.17 should do that and call it a switch hitter and I just I think that's so

00:24:07.02 funny I wish I had I knew the name that whoever that was it's a great comment I

00:24:11.06 think that's a great idea too and I I don't know you know based on how

00:24:14.13 successful this switch [ __ ] is maybe we do do that maybe we make one why not

00:24:18.17 right I'm just excited about toading the hole that's gonna be good yeah when's

00:24:23.23 episode one coming out of toad in the hole that's less schedule Eric [Laughter]

00:24:31.21 time after MVP too e-movie we'll get that on the calendar

00:24:36.14 man all you have to do is uh just book me and one other British person

00:24:43.10 the problem is Gavin doesn't like other British people

00:24:50.19 anytime there'd be like a British person in the periphery I think he'd always be

00:24:55.16 like I don't like having them around I'm

00:24:57.20 I'm I want to be the only British person around here

00:25:01.01 do you believe that Derek I I think that

00:25:04.19 you've said it one time you think I said I want to be the only British person

00:25:11.04 around one time he said it more than once I think if Geoff is saying it I

00:25:16.08 think it happened one time maybe this is all happened from one time we were out

00:25:22.01 at a bar

00:25:24.19 one time this all stems from this one time we were apart and just some it was

00:25:30.00 like South by Southwest so there were more British people in town and one of

00:25:34.18 them just like was chatting to us uh Geoff just did that thing the thing where

00:25:38.15 he's like why don't you like that guy why are you sitting next to that guy and

00:25:43.02 I was like huh that's where this came from

00:25:45.22 so what are you saying here because he did say it sure.

00:25:54.18 I think what toad of the hole needs to be based on Gavin's hatred of British

00:26:01.00 people you can possibly have one show with one person I think Eric you need to

00:26:06.16 book like 12 British people and Gavin as soon as you get tired of the British

00:26:11.12 person you're currently talking to you yell toad in the hole they have to

00:26:15.04 immediately leave and the next person comes in and it just goes as long as it

00:26:21.00 goes the series ends when we run out of Brits we'll have a toad in the hole on

00:26:24.22 the desk and like for each sausage in the pan is one person that can come in

00:26:30.05 and they have to take their sausage this is great we've already we've

00:26:35.01 developed the show it's not sausage toad in the hole is a food that Gavin has

00:26:40.01 shown us and Andrew has made it a catchphrase similar to fire in the hole

00:26:45.20 to get somebody out as quickly and you have to take your sausage and

00:26:51.04 leave so it's whatever I get bored yeah whenever you're done when you're

00:26:55.03 done with them yeah yeah you're like we're good in the hole

00:27:00.09 a story yeah well exactly you can control that and they don't know what

00:27:05.10 that means so they just they get pushed offset as soon as you say it they don't

00:27:10.01 understand who's doing the pushing uh anybody I don't know it's not my job

00:27:14.15 listen I came up with all the other stuff you could figure out a thing or two

00:27:20.23 bringing 80 of the genius here oh speaking of other other shows [Music]

00:27:25.13 um I really want to do we talked about doing a thing with tpg yeah you guys

00:27:30.16 need to see the notes for it I would love to do the first one we're talking

00:27:34.17 about doing one of us with tpg and just rotating out different episodes okay

00:27:38.11 based on the notes he gave like a toad in the whole sort of format like a toad

00:27:43.01 in the whole sort of format yeah exactly you get it

00:27:47.00 I'd love to do the first one I'm excited that thing is great and I feel like

00:27:50.21 where do I on the topic of yeah we should I they need to be sent to

00:27:54.21 you Eric sent them to me they're not available I don't have them

00:27:58.23 queued up I'm just I'm thinking about okay

00:28:02.11 they are and I can't open them unless I give them 8.95. They're clogging up the.

00:28:08.04 Bingo machine they're stuck in the tube I got and we all did one of the best

00:28:13.23 unexpected emails I've ever received and longed in a long time the Apple Odyssey

00:28:19.02 2K 22. And nobody responded by the way well I didn't know I didn't really know

00:28:24.20 what to reply to it sounds like a great offer I guess well no no I guess it is

00:28:30.10 I'm excited to pick apples at some point I didn't know

00:28:34.21 I forget that tpg is a Boston guy yeah nothing about him feels Boston really

00:28:40.09 to me yeah no he feels very West Coast to me and my interactions with him I

00:28:45.07 mean he's been on both coasts yeah a bit of a mixed bag

00:28:48.01 well I've spent the least amount of time with him I'd say out of the three but

00:28:52.16 just in the stories I've heard and the interactions I've had feels very like

00:28:56.15 California okay he's a huge Celtics fan Izzy yeah that's great yeah big time Big.

00:29:01.03 Time you should talk to him about that that's a great email I made my day that

00:29:04.22 tpg email genuinely I was so happy to see it it's great have you explained

00:29:08.23 what it is yet in this what the email people like to do people know what

00:29:13.05 you're talking about no I guess not without any content I mean do they know

00:29:18.05 who tpg is to what extent do I need we've talked about tpg and he's the guy

00:29:22.07 that Gavin used to go to the go to movies with like the cool guy movie club

00:29:28.06 uh and then he moved to back home to Boston well I'm pretty sure I just

00:29:31.16 joined Eric and tpg's Movie Club oh okay

00:29:34.13 uh and he's a guy that we all like a lot yeah he's great

00:29:39.09 he sent an email asking or not asking I guess inviting us to explore different

00:29:44.14 apples based out of the the Mass area it was a very enthusiastic and clever

00:29:50.05 email is it post November well that's the thing he didn't give a specific date

00:29:54.08 at all so it theoretically could be post November so you'll set foot in Boston

00:29:59.12 I would be willing to post November yeah I'm open to that idea good I've been

00:30:03.19 very clear this entire time okay post November post November now wait wait

00:30:09.12 wait wait a minute what is post to know are you by saying post November sounds

00:30:13.09 like this to me no that's right that was bad phrasing on my part

00:30:17.04 this bad phrase so from now I want to get into it here I'm not going to expand

00:30:22.11 on this it's a personal thing I did accidentally enter America recently was

00:30:27.16 an accident didn't mean to I was there so I did I broke the

00:30:31.16 November thing but it wasn't my choice yeah it was it was a brief thing that

00:30:38.04 occurred uh and uh I apologize tripped over a log across the border

00:30:41.11 what happened I I sort of did I'm not gonna get into all the details it's a

00:30:46.12 personal story but I ended up in Eagle it was it was legal it was on very legal

00:30:51.16 it's very approved well U.S and they yell towed in the hole and I had to get

00:30:55.18 immediately removed it was a whole this is how the law works on behalf of

00:31:00.06 all Americans let me say it was great to have you and we hope you come back.

00:31:04.18 [Applause]

00:31:07.04 Now a word from our sponsor better help sometimes I found things can be really

00:31:13.23 overwhelming especially if there are issues that just keep on mounting and

00:31:18.19 you're stuck in kind of like a problem solving mode but just as things increase

00:31:24.09 those issues even if they're small just when you have a lot going on it could be

00:31:28.13 difficult to sort through them and navigate and have effective strategies

00:31:32.09 on working through those problems it can be tough to train your brain to

00:31:36.04 stay in a problem-solving mode when faced with a challenge in life but when

00:31:39.18 you learn how to find your own Solutions there's no better feeling a therapist

00:31:43.11 can help you become a better Problem Solver making it easier to accomplish

00:31:52.02 impact in my life and has helped me in so many ways and sorting through all

00:32:07.12 it's a really healthy thing to experience and it has provided a

00:33:52.11 face using the internet without expressvpn is

00:33:56.02 like leaving your phone by the side of the tub most of the time you're probably

00:34:00.17 fine but other times you'll turn and realize that your phone has now died of

00:34:04.21 watery death why does everyone need a VPN because every time you connect to an

00:34:09.15 unencrypted Network whether it be cafes hotels or airports any hacker on the

00:34:17.19 details all of that important personal stuff it doesn't take much technical

00:34:22.12 knowledge to hack someone just some cheap Hardware is needed a smart 12 year

00:34:30.22 dollars per person selling personal info

00:34:33.06 on the dark web now there's all sorts of reasons why to use expressvpn but some

00:34:37.10 of my favorites are that the fact they have an encrypted tunnel it creates a

00:34:41.03 secure encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet hackers can't

00:34:45.04 steal your sensitive data that way it's super secure it take a hacker with a

00:34:49.18 super computer over a billion years to get past expressvpn's encryption it's

00:34:54.06 easy to thieves all you have to do is fire up the app and click one button to

00:34:59.05 get protected works on all of your devices phones laptops tablets and more

00:35:03.05 so you can stay secure on the go expressvpn is a fantastic service I've

00:35:33.16 am I could I be involved in your thing Gavin because I'm from BC which is

00:35:39.10 British Columbia do I get like a little bit

00:35:42.22 of credit uh the queen is on my money true I feel like if it's the equivalent

00:35:49.15 I'm as British as goldfish are Goldfish crackers are a g food yeah

00:35:57.00 I think those are equal hey speaking of which I I have a procedural question uh

00:36:02.12 does does this mean now does all the money get reprinted with King Charles

00:36:08.02 I have no idea that's an interesting thought do you know do you know that guy

00:36:12.14 I mean I assume that when they make new I don't I don't think they're gonna like

00:36:16.10 they're not gonna invalidate all the existing money they'll just like going

00:36:20.07 forward start printing him yeah I mean to be fair they should just probably

00:36:26.04 skip him all together he's he he somehow like he looks older than she did

00:36:31.18 you guys saying in that picture right yeah

00:36:34.22 yeah I don't know I mean the coronation I think the coronation can take up to

00:36:39.00 like I think the queen was technically Queen

00:36:41.23 for over a year before she was coronated so it's all a very slow changeover even

00:36:47.12 though technically he was immediately the king probably a lot of paperwork who

00:36:52.16 would you say is the most beloved British figure living at this point

00:36:57.07 Beckham really I think Beckham ranks Rowan Atkinson yeah and we talking.

00:37:02.13 International because like I think David Beckham

00:37:06.20 maybe prove yeah Paul Hollywood is who is Paul Hollywood he's uh he's one of

00:37:12.10 the judges on Great British Bake Off okay he's got the frosted tips oh that

00:37:17.15 guy that's Paul Hollywood yeah okay it's great Great Name by the way

00:37:22.03 sounds real it's a fantastic name hey speaking of uh other shows uh real

00:37:27.13 fast I just uh just some uh housekeeping so we did uh what is what was formally

00:37:33.12 known at and I'm this also serving as a notification to you guys uh Eric and I

00:37:37.05 shot what was formerly known as uh Facebook [ __ ] yesterday uh it was kind

00:37:42.07 of a surprise episode and it was a surprise because uh Eric

00:37:46.17 and I were both very very very busy uh the last couple days and neither of us

00:37:50.07 had the time to promote it so we realized yesterday morning that nobody

00:37:53.05 on Earth knew we were about to do a break show so I tried to cancel it and

00:37:57.13 Eric was too professional to let me do that and so we did it anyway uh but then

00:38:01.11 as a big surprise uh minor fan I guess majorly fan Jack showed up and and

00:38:06.08 shared the whole thing with us wow so he he has actually appeared on that show

00:38:10.17 now uh and he was great on it and it was great to have him I gotta admit uh but

00:38:14.18 also and the reason I said formally is I've decided and I hope you guys don't

00:38:18.03 mind uh but I've decided to change the name of that show to something less

00:38:22.09 confusing so I'm just gonna call it the break show from here on out and I think

00:38:26.07 that that will help it attract audiences

00:38:29.17 on YouTube that the break show the break show yeah it's uh just a it's a wider

00:38:35.11 net to cast for so you took face off it no I took break [ __ ] off of it

00:38:39.08 man that really happens outside for the other show please make [ __ ]

00:38:43.11 no it doesn't we can still do that or we could call it the make the make show

00:38:48.09 that's enough isn't that like a euphemism for taking a [ __ ]

00:38:52.13 uh it can be yeah like I had to make like I had to make water for peeing the.

00:38:59.04 Push a what you never heard like oh the dog made on the floor no yeah I've heard

00:39:04.08 that I think it's like East Coast talk in it uh I don't I have no idea I've

00:39:10.18 just never heard it oh made anyway so Jack uh Jack actually showed up for once

00:39:16.01 and uh oh yeah obviously obviously you all didn't you were very busy I get it

00:39:19.16 uh Emily didn't show up either it was just Eric you just said no one knew

00:39:22.23 about it uh no one being the audience in that case why not cancel it oh

00:39:29.20 because uh no one knew about it and you wanted to cancel it why don't you just

00:39:35.10 move it my question is did Jack know about it or did you trap him no Jack

00:39:40.03 knew about it Eric did it was something Eric did on uh in the background like so

00:39:44.13 he invited Jack to it and I didn't know he just shot Andrew you knew about it

00:39:48.17 we both knew about it we both said we couldn't do it yeah Gavin did you not

00:39:52.06 know that you knew about it [Laughter]

00:39:55.13 you not only knew about it you said no to it right okay yeah I mean I didn't

00:40:01.10 okay okay I just forgot you said could you do this

00:40:03.19 I said no and I just forgot about it I didn't know if it was the same way it

00:40:06.23 could have been a different one you're making it sound like it popped up out of

00:40:10.06 nowhere uh to the audience it did that was the point I was making I still don't

00:40:14.21 understand why you wouldn't couldn't just move it if nobody was expecting it

00:40:17.22 because we've been trying to schedule the monkey movie since March and it's

00:40:23.01 about October yeah he's right and also we hadn't done

00:40:26.05 one in September and I tried to do one a

00:40:27.01 month and if we didn't make it this week we wouldn't get it in October we

00:40:30.06 wouldn't get it till mid-October he was right and it turned out to be a great

00:40:33.23 show we had a lot of fun uh I don't even know how to tell you guys about Bingo

00:40:39.10 but I am I know about Bingo you know about bingo I am very excited about.

00:40:42.14 Bingo Bingo the dog because somebody one of Eric's friends sent in a pack of

00:40:46.11 bingo cards and they were some of the best cards I have ever seen in my life

00:40:50.13 I've always wanted to see that movie I haven't seen it before but I just know

00:40:54.03 it's like a it's about a dog that does all sorts of crazy [ __ ] right like an

00:40:58.10 almost Air Bud but like unlimited stuff yeah he like as I understand because

00:41:03.09 Jack had seen it and was very excited to retell it uh bingo uh bingo ended up in

00:41:09.00 the circus somehow but the circus the circus boss was mean and made Bingo do

00:41:14.23 bad so yeah Bingo uh had to jump through Flames we have a really sad card of

00:41:20.08 bingo staring at fire and it just says Bingo can't do it and we want to put

00:41:24.01 that on a show hurt and then somehow Bingo was owned by the place kicker for

00:41:28.16 the New York Jets or no for the uh yeah the.

00:41:32.22 Jets yeah and then he got traded to the Packers got lost along the way or he

00:41:37.21 eventually got reunited and the bad circus boss got got his I guess but uh

00:41:43.12 it was I want to see the movie very badly too and I even said to Eric I was

00:41:47.23 like oh we should add this we should add this to the list of movies we need to

00:41:52.03 watch and he looked at me like if he could have killed me with his eyes in

00:41:55.08 that moment I think he would have what if we do is still a week of movies what

00:41:58.21 if that's what we use in office because we can't schedule a day of movie no but

00:42:03.13 if we what if we just do an office one of our office days we just watch movies

00:42:07.21 that's true but the next office day has to get

00:42:10.22 rescheduled because Geoff is out of town that's my fault that's on me okay I also

00:42:16.06 told you guys about that at least a month ago that's true it's not like a

00:42:21.10 new surprise I've known about that for a while I

00:42:24.02 think I think that I think when we uh when we decided to do the first one and

00:42:27.18 we scheduled them I said I'm gonna have to cancel the second one immediately

00:42:31.12 foreign

00:42:35.20 that's Bingo oh no we gotta see this movie oh my God

00:42:42.06 it's a comedy enough film it's it's funny right like this is a Kids film

00:42:47.23 right this is [Music]

00:42:54.07 pause on the Bible [Music]

00:43:00.21 oh my God and you don't have the Bingo can't do it do you Eric I've been

00:43:05.14 looking the whole time for it I'm looking so hard man I want to put that

00:43:10.08 on a shirt so bad yeah I think I think we talked about it I think we probably

00:43:14.17 just could right I mean you know ask for forgiveness

00:43:18.13 right man I'm always trying to find bingo can't do it and it is just it's

00:43:22.21 it's you just you get a bunch of bingo cards I just tried myself yeah yeah

00:43:27.07 oh my God I feel like if you illegally make Bingo merchandise that guy with the

00:43:32.08 gun is the guy who's coming for you like I don't know

00:43:36.13 who pursue you in the Bingo universe uh well you know what

00:43:39.18 let's keep Bingo out there in the periphery and maybe if we do a movie

00:43:42.23 week or if we have some extra time after

00:43:45.00 monkey movie maybe we could slot that in I feel like that was another movie we

00:43:48.16 wanted to we wanted to watch about a oh um was it like a George C Scott movie or

00:43:54.17 something uh the Pelican or something no it was uh it was um

00:43:58.13 the football one the football action movie oh a Last Boy Scout yeah we talked

00:44:03.22 yeah we should do that one too we should definitely do that

00:44:08.04 we're gonna have a great movie day one day I can't wait it's so fantastic I

00:44:12.23 have to ask because now the the deadline was moved again is the banana white

00:44:17.21 presentation finished no it would have been finished today but because it got

00:44:24.07 rescheduled it's not done eighty percent of it is done

00:44:28.22 I'm gonna finish it either this week or next week now is it fair is it fair to

00:44:34.06 say that it's been rescheduled I think at this point it's just been

00:44:37.15 de-scheduled right like is it on the books anywhere currently let's get it on

00:44:43.04 the books okay all right let me pull up my calendar

00:45:54.08 is that what you were telling us is that you lost the the monkey presentation no

00:46:00.14 I haven't started putting in any of the slides yet but I got the stuff okay 80

00:46:05.13 done guys 80 well that's the easy part it's just you drop the photos in I got

00:46:09.05 the photos in I got the script I'm emailing zoos I'm doing everything that

00:46:13.09 I need to do he's like I'm 80 of the way

00:46:15.19 done I have all the puzzle pieces I just got to put them together real fast yeah

00:46:19.08 I'm excited for the 18th of October when you start working on this again no it's

00:46:24.12 gonna get kicked fully back into gear next week

00:46:28.21 did you say you're emailing zoos that's fine uh anyway I had to re-watch it

00:46:34.02 again and I'm gonna do the script that's the motivator I've seen this movie like

00:46:38.14 five times now don't want to watch it again

00:46:41.12 I enjoy it I don't enjoy it that much I was never a huge MVP guy loved MVP too

00:46:47.02 that was the thing which I've only seen two times maybe so

00:46:49.23 it's a great discrepancy in my watches do you think MVP like this has improved

00:46:55.22 your opinion of MVP or worsened it I think

00:46:59.12 what's fascinating about this is I have rewatched the first five minutes of mvp2

00:47:03.14 within the last year and it has nothing to do with what MVP has to do so I'm

00:47:08.23 really I'm recapping a movie for context that there is none for MVP too there's

00:47:12.17 you're not going to take anything away it's sort of a pointless Endeavor

00:47:17.23 summarizing MVP one for the purpose of going into mvp2 they don't connect in

00:47:22.01 any way if we didn't already have deep lore about nothing I would nominate it's

00:47:27.06 sort of a pointless Endeavor as the tag line for this podcast it's a great

00:47:32.15 tag line yeah deep lore about nothing is way better

00:47:35.05 though it also describes Gavin's uh ability to have to become friendly with

00:47:40.23 another British person [Laughter]

00:47:44.23 excited for toad in the hole it's gonna be great

00:47:48.03 oh man we need to do the trip thing too that also has to go on the schedule can

00:47:53.07 I include this is the I've been wondering about

00:47:57.13 this can a Corn based snack be in the rotation does it have to be a chip

00:48:03.19 uh well well like like a bugle uh yeah bugle this is the one I was

00:48:07.04 thinking more as the the as you made fun of them you mock Canada's one of.

00:48:10.23 Canada's great snacks as saying it looks like Carnival Food the cheesies

00:48:15.15 I would like to submit the cheesies because I do feel it is an iconic staple

00:48:20.13 of Canadian snacking is that made by Utz it's not made by Yachts it's made by

00:48:26.05 Hawkins okay um different companies dude the whole

00:48:29.00 reason I went to Walmart was to get those Utz cheese balls brand I could

00:48:33.23 find called Utz and they said They Carried him uh

00:48:37.11 uh I I don't know man I don't know maybe we need to have like a like a separate

00:48:42.19 category for non-chip based flavors here's the thing though if we do

00:48:47.17 that we're never gonna do that category we're only gonna do the chip snack thing

00:48:52.13 once we're not doing multiple iterations of it I don't think so it just will

00:48:55.16 never be included how are we doing that what do you mean is that an in-person

00:49:00.10 thing no I think we all submit I think it could be like the Apple review I

00:49:04.18 think we all submit three flavors that come from our country and then we uh

00:49:09.03 have them and review them at the time yeah no there's no way I can narrow it

00:49:14.01 down to three we got what snack attack build a snack like whatever

00:49:17.22 yeah you got a tough lineup I I feel like it's very definitive for me fuzzy

00:49:22.17 wizzles Zippy zazus I mean I'm also I'm scouting

00:49:27.14 I don't think I talked about it before did I show you the the KFC chips that

00:49:32.14 Canada just got no KFC is doing a brand of Ruffles uh only

00:49:38.17 for Canada only for Canada because Kentucky is in my country yeah it's a

00:49:44.04 strange Choice by then um here put it in the chat all right

00:49:49.00 beat me to it already uh yeah so I've been doing my scouting original recipe

00:49:55.06 chicken KFC slash pfk is the French version KFC they're just

00:49:58.15 chicken chips I was very disappointed there's nothing Kentucky Fried Chicken

00:50:04.05 flavor really about them I don't think I've ever had a chicken chip really yeah

00:50:09.07 chicken's not a flavor for potato chips in America it's

00:50:13.11 almond either in Canada but it's it sometimes appears it's more of I do it

00:50:17.15 as like a British flavor yeah that's a lot of roast chicken walkers and all

00:50:21.23 that you fan of a chicken chip Gavin yeah I don't mind it it's a nice flavor

00:50:26.17 good it's a good chip uh will you be submitting a chicken chip Gavin I don't

00:50:30.16 think Walker's roast chicken is a unique enough flavor like it's got nothing on

00:50:35.21 frazzles in my opinion what the [ __ I is a frazzle well let's

00:50:40.01 not go down that farther [Laughter]

00:50:43.01 oh man yeah that looks very Bland and my head of frazzle is like is like a weird

00:50:48.17 blue shade and it's no that's right that's not that's the chicken yeah

00:50:53.05 that's frazzles it's the bacon that looks like dude that looks like a dog

00:50:58.07 treat it does look like it that looks like a that looks like something I'd

00:51:01.23 give Henry I'd put a pill like it's got a pill pocket in it brazzles are so it's

00:51:05.20 one of those things like I can taste afreso in my mouth right now it's it's

00:51:09.11 pierced my brain and you can imagine it will ah are you sure you haven't just

00:51:14.13 you you're not just eating frazzles as we speak no I don't think okay okay I

00:51:20.07 just had to check and the fun thing about frazzles is if

00:51:23.20 Geoff was uh in the bingo game with them they could also be known as Razzles

00:51:29.03 or S's uh to be fair I I never went deeper than

00:51:35.02 two letters so at the most it could have been azzles

00:51:38.20 below the the actual picture of the crisp would be a thumb he will

00:51:43.22 potentially you said that like it makes you a man of integrity like we can all

00:51:49.03 get abort like we can all join in on editing two letters out but three no

00:51:54.12 like that was a hot and fast rule it just happened to me that there wasn't a

00:51:58.15 letter U deeper into the word otherwise no I I I did that was a hard and fast

00:52:03.07 rule I kept I I have ethics you at least attempt to find an ugly fruit because I

00:52:08.08 really want to know what they taste like and I'm disappointed that we did I did

00:52:13.05 attempt to find one and I did not find one I've never seen one in any store

00:52:16.20 anywhere even if he did find one we wouldn't have gotten a picture of it

00:52:29.19 it looks like an orange cut into a pumpkin for warmth and is living inside

00:52:36.21 it does that's a great description Andrew it looks terrible it looks like

00:52:42.12 it it looks like an orange is eating a pumpkin from the inside out

00:52:50.04 if anyone in the audience has had an ugly fruit please let us know I'd love

00:52:55.06 to I just it looks dry and flavorless but it does

00:52:58.21 I hear they're quite sweet though right really well yeah there's ugly pie which

00:53:03.01 has nothing to do with ugly fruit it's just like didn't find any of that either

00:53:07.02 I did find an upside down Burger though you did

00:53:10.06 some might say you you created it you just like fine to me implies that like

00:53:15.04 somebody else did it and you uncovered it well I created I created this whole

00:53:19.13 segment so uh and that's that's true sure I guess I did

00:53:23.08 did we ever go through Geoff's pictures and like read out what he actually ate

00:53:29.14 no I just assumed all of it because uh yeah oh but like what they were what

00:53:33.06 they actually were oh I felt like they were all pretty obvious products well

00:53:37.21 just in case uh let's see it was yeah it looks like uh sandwiches cheese balls

00:53:44.07 waffles mac and cheese Burger burrito burrito Nutty Buddy

00:53:49.12 gushers stuffed crust pizza Crunch and Munch and munchos potato chips oh and

00:53:54.10 up cake was actually a cupcake okay foreign

00:54:00.13 but I had a little football on it would you ever do that again Geoff as the

00:54:06.06 creator of this bet oh yeah I loved it I had a blast doing it

00:54:10.16 you do it again oh do it again in a second yeah

00:54:14.11 does the letters that exist make you less willing at all like the U is out so

00:54:20.09 nobody can get a u but the p is gone too I feel like there's a lot there's a lot

00:54:26.15 of easy letters in there you think so I think so B would be easy B would be

00:54:32.14 phenomenal B is a great one yeah but C would be good

00:54:36.19 what do you got with C uh chicken that's a great one done

00:54:41.07 cheese chicken oh delicious uh uh uh churro [ __ ] dude I can just eat churros

00:54:48.14 for four days this is a question that I feel like is

00:54:52.12 less impactful for Geoff but what was the food you missed the most Gavin when

00:54:57.11 you're doing your thing um I don't really miss any food really

00:55:02.02 there's no you're weird with food you're not a big food you don't enjoy food

00:55:06.19 there's no joy in it for you nah I just I mean I was excited to be done eating

00:55:11.18 yeah that's when I sit down let's get this over with the same with sleeping

00:55:16.16 like when it's night time I'm just annoyed I'm like annoyed it's really

00:55:20.07 excited about it being bright again no that's fair because nighttime to you

00:55:24.06 means you're inflating your stomach with air like it's not it's a different

00:55:29.20 relationship for sleep like I guess the point where it's like

00:55:32.14 11 and I'm tired I'm like Ugh I just want to skip to the bit where I'm I've

00:55:36.10 got energy again and the sun's up I totally agree with you buddy I have

00:55:40.09 started going to bed at nine o'clock P.M and maybe that's just my age but I got

00:55:44.18 just so I can I'd much rather be awake at five in the morning than awake at

00:55:48.21 midnight yeah all right are you still backed up Gavin has that ever resolved

00:55:53.23 are you now that we've done this food challenge are you yeah I've got to like

00:55:57.12 reset my gut I think because I had I had

00:55:59.20 bad gut after travel I was a bit stopped up after landing back in the US and I

00:56:05.10 poured a bunch of weird food all over it like Godzilla rolls and gumbo and uh

00:56:10.16 and I'll be honest I've had a lot of heart but

00:56:14.05 oh no the gumbo was mad heartburn for me with the heartburn could you relate to

00:56:20.00 me saying I've never felt more Mortal it's tough when you have bad heartburn

00:56:23.17 it brings you down it's a terrible feeling yeah the worst part of it is it

00:56:28.12 felt like my whole throat was like a little bit acidic and then

00:56:31.12 whenever I drank my sparkling grapefruit it felt funny

00:56:36.03 I really think you need to try to push everything out with the CPAP machine I

00:56:41.07 know I suggested it in the past I just think like turning your body into like a

00:56:46.16 toothpaste dispenser to try to like get things out I think would be funny if it

00:56:51.23 works the less you know you know when a pump is running a little dry and it

00:56:55.08 starts buttering the last thing I want is my anus doing that in the night that

00:57:00.17 seems like nightmare fuel oh God oh

00:57:08.02 this is nice.

00:57:14.15 I think uh I think I broke my finger the other day what do you mean

00:57:19.16 uh I think my finger might be broken and my ankle I realized emotionally has it

00:57:25.16 just has not been right since the bike wreck all right yeah when pit boy is out

00:57:31.20 so what's up so my knee my knee is like a hundred percent uh I would say my

00:57:37.08 ankle is that like I thought it was at like 85 I think it's more like 60. Like

00:57:41.15 I can't put pressure on it in certain directions still and it's real tight now

00:57:45.19 do you have an issue where like when you

00:57:47.18 lift your does it sometimes just pop out for you a little bit like you have to

00:57:51.13 like slide it back in okay no no I don't have that issue uh and then but my my

00:57:56.03 finger the other day I was we went to the grocery store this is about three

00:57:59.23 weeks ago now and we went to the grocery store and I was bringing groceries in

00:58:03.17 plastic grocery bags and I just picked up a bunch of grocery bags with my left

00:58:07.14 and right hand and my I guess like all the weight from a bunch of bags just

00:58:13.15 ended up on my right index finger and it

00:58:15.09 bit wrong and hurt very sharply and very weird and then it snapped back into

00:58:19.13 place real fast and I thought like oh maybe I sprained it or whatever but then

00:58:23.15 I got real swollen for a while and then it's fine again now but if uh if I push

00:58:28.08 on it in the wrong direction it hurts so bad I almost pass out so I think oh my.

00:58:32.10 God I mean first off I'm just not gonna push on it in that direction anymore but

00:58:35.17 I'm wondering I mean I can still bend it

00:58:39.04 and stuff but it doesn't feel right like it should hurt like that and be so

00:58:43.09 blaringly painful and uh but it's my right hand and I'm left-handed

00:58:48.10 so I'm not super concerned all right is this going to impact your potential

00:58:53.10 swing in the future and I don't know okay I I am a little concerned about

00:58:57.14 that but uh we don't really have any baseballs coming up in the future and

00:59:02.20 when the next time we do it I'll be sharing the wealth with everybody else

00:59:05.21 so yeah it just it brings me joy knowing

00:59:08.21 that you can hit dingers and it would be sad to me if you have lost any ability

00:59:12.19 to do I know just I know it's me and Aaron judge right just [ __ ] cranking

00:59:16.23 me I'm really worried about hitting baseballs by the way why what way

00:59:20.20 because Geoff makes it look really easy and the more I watch him do it the more

00:59:25.15 I think oh I could just do that I don't I

00:59:29.02 I think everyone's gonna make fun of me that'll happen yeah

00:59:32.21 guarantee yeah yeah well we would hit baseballs the last time I asked Geoff if

00:59:38.04 he thought you could hit these baseballs and I said maybe Gavin's a secret

00:59:42.14 athlete and then you walked over to us and almost just fell walking over yeah

00:59:47.05 you did like a Pratt Hall in front of us was that before or after uh you picked

00:59:52.07 up the paint to throw away and left a trail all across the park.

01:00:00.10 I feed going out the door over a freaking table of chairs

01:00:06.00 it went up the trash can and into the trash a cartoon

01:00:13.17 did we get a picture of that maybe I did let me see

01:00:19.03 uh it was [ __ ] funny though I will say Kevin can't be a little bit of a

01:00:24.13 freak athlete going back to the time we went to pinballs that Gavin doesn't

01:00:29.23 remember we played one of those games where you have to like throw the ball at

01:00:35.02 the Target and Gavin had by far the worst form of throwing a ball I've ever

01:00:40.19 seen yet he somehow could hit them constantly he had incredible accuracy it

01:00:45.04 just looked horrendous so I could see a similar situation where your swing is

01:00:49.01 terrible but you hit it pretty far I'm kind of like that with bowling too where

01:00:53.14 oh God outwards to the point where physics just sends my body at like 45

01:00:58.19 degrees the other way and it looks like I'm gonna fall yeah then the weight of

01:01:02.22 the ball like reasserts me to the center and I get a strike like I didn't really

01:01:07.01 know I'm imagining that you going to roll the ball looks like a like a giant

01:01:11.18 clock you know like the pendulum at like the ball just goes left and right and

01:01:16.06 then somehow you strike it oh strike oh you know what I don't have any photos

01:01:21.01 of it but I do have a photo of something that I built can I show you guys

01:01:24.14 something that I made last weekend I was

01:01:26.12 trying to think of like why I don't have anything to talk about this week and

01:01:30.07 then I realized I spent probably 25

01:01:33.09 hours from Friday night to Sunday night making something and I'm very very proud

01:01:37.21 of that I want to show you guys let me see if I can send this to you right now

01:01:40.23 if you don't mind completely forgot this isn't funny or anything I just want to

01:01:44.10 share it with you no I want to say I'm excited um I was really I was really

01:01:49.21 proud of it uh let's see it's gonna be Geoff showing his [ __ ] to us after

01:01:54.20 this is my weekend it's been 25 hours on this oh that's so

01:01:59.23 cool it's my Halloween Tiny Town yeah yeah that's so sweet what so what that

01:02:05.04 is is that's a it's a it's a circular table of a 48 inch circular table and on

01:02:10.16 top of it I've put down a layer of foam that I cut and then painted and glued

01:02:15.23 grass to and then on top of that I built with foam I carved a mountain uh with

01:02:21.14 like Steps going up and then I painted and grasped it all and then I built uh

01:02:27.00 like a little city for all of our little

01:02:29.20 Halloween Village did you buy the houses the houses are bought yeah I've been

01:02:33.01 buying them we've been buying those over

01:02:35.12 time like this it looks amazing I forgot how hard you go on on Halloween I don't

01:02:38.15 [ __ ] around right so this is how it started could you could you please pull.

01:02:44.05 Gavin's uh when Geoff said that he bought

01:02:47.08 the house the the tone of disappointment and zero respect given

01:02:50.22 you always misinterpret my own no no you're listening to my O's wrong I'm

01:02:55.15 gonna have to hear it back to see if you're right we'll run it back see it

01:02:59.15 went it started like that and then you can see like that's how I planned it out

01:03:03.23 and then uh and then I and then I carved it

01:03:07.06 like that and then I built and then I just slowly painted it and put it all

01:03:10.16 together it was so much fun it did a lot too uh she did a lot of the finer work

01:03:14.09 but I did all the like the assembly and did that give you the joy of of what you

01:03:18.03 get like the relaxation of riding a bike

01:03:20.02 was it quite therapeutic to make that it was it looks fun I mean I mean I was

01:03:23.12 stressed the [ __ ] out for a lot of it it was pretty overwhelming uh but

01:03:28.05 ultimately yes it was it was a really fun experience uh and I was very proud

01:03:32.09 so cool thank you so much Emily did a wonderful job in putting that together

01:03:38.15 it's a great festive Vibe um yeah it's amazing

01:03:41.20 wait I started talking about this is cool because Geoff's other podcast

01:03:45.06 co-host wasn't so stoked when he saw it yeah I shot it to Gus

01:03:50.23 oh even even oh Gus yelled at me for wasting time and money on something so

01:03:56.21 stupid as as having as getting excited about a holiday

01:04:01.23 he was like it was exactly exactly what I expected to hear

01:04:08.02 you know you just reminded me of something Gavin you're still my alert

01:04:13.11 noise on my phone you're oh oh no is my alert noise I just had my phone muted

01:04:18.07 most of the time so I don't know I was gonna say I how does your partner feel

01:04:21.17 about that so it's it's well not that's not the issue they think it's very funny

01:04:26.05 what the problem is is we had uh it was our unit was inspected recently and so

01:04:31.13 I'm sitting there and I'm just like going about my day and I had my alerts

01:04:35.18 on which was unusual and then I realized

01:04:37.12 without context this sounds horrible I'm

01:04:40.04 just in a room by myself they don't know what it is they just keep hearing a

01:04:44.15 person going oh oh no oh oh no I was getting like all these texts at once and

01:04:48.22 it was just somebody I was like oh this I had to mute my phone I was panicking I

01:04:52.18 accidentally turned it louder than it was it was terrible I was so anxious

01:04:56.17 it's just them hearing you go oh oh no oh no oh no oh oh no why is your place

01:05:01.15 always get inspected has it been inspected in like eight months I don't

01:05:05.01 know what you're talking about that's quite a lot that's pretty often is it

01:05:09.10 okay I yeah I don't know yeah I I maybe we just don't have safety in America we

01:05:15.01 just don't inspect stuff uh do you remember Gavin when my ringtone used to

01:05:20.22 be the porn stars oh no that was like this porn star on the Howard Stern Show

01:05:25.01 one time he ended up dating Robin Quivers briefly briefly apparently his

01:05:28.16 name was Nick Manning and he uh don't look this stuff up by the way but anyway

01:05:32.03 he was trying to come up with catch phrases he uh he thought like porn he

01:05:37.13 thought like porn dudes needed catchphrases so he had uh he had some

01:05:42.12 pretty nasty catchphrases and I turned I would always set my ringtone to one of

01:05:46.17 them so because I thought that would be funny and uh and then I thought it'd be

01:05:50.15 like it's you know it's honestly it was trying to face myself right like forget

01:05:54.07 about it put myself in a situation where I have to walk my way out of it uh the

01:05:58.15 worst time that happened was in my daughter's fourth grade uh parent

01:06:04.18 teacher oh no my phone rang and all you could hear from my pocket was some dude

01:06:08.08 yelling wet [ __ ] oh no oh yeah yeah no that wasn't even the one that got the

01:06:13.08 worst reaction from people at some point oh you had like the middle of some punk

01:06:18.00 song yeah where it's just a woman screaming

01:06:21.17 like as if she's being murdered it's it was and it got every single person in

01:06:27.00 every building to turn their head it was I used to have to look the other way

01:06:31.17 whenever you got a call in public I've held on to that one I still put it

01:06:36.11 in a lot when I'm when I'm feeling a little young

01:06:40.04 again like I want to face my self I'll throw that one in I won't do the porn

01:06:44.07 ones anymore he got another one he had another one that just said dropping

01:06:50.01 loads and that was my ringtone for a while too uh but yeah there you go uh

01:06:54.09 dropping loads uh but yeah now I I just have a regular ringtone most of the time

01:06:59.07 but sometimes I do that Bikini Kill song Still That Bikini Kill song was so bad

01:07:04.21 it was it's so much worse than you could imagine

01:07:08.09 my favorite Manning brother Nick Manning

01:07:11.03 I'd love to imagine their heart and same family ha ha ha
