00:00:00.02 [Music]

00:00:09.11 [Music]

00:00:15.11 I think the dictionary kid might be a young owl

00:00:19.16 yeah oh I was thinking like an open book I also I don't want it to be an owl

00:00:24.19 because something about dictionary kid is very stable on the topic

00:00:29.08 it's a very stable persona nobody wants to stab the dictionary kid no well you

00:00:35.01 know remember tomorrow uh tomorrow never dies is that the bond movie with the

00:00:39.12 last the he'll know this [ __ I guy will know Gavin what's the last bond

00:00:44.04 movie with brazen tomorrow never dies die another day try another day he she

00:00:49.01 [ __ ] goes to stab the lady and she's got a bible in her jacket and it stabs

00:00:53.20 the bible and then she puts the bible and she

00:00:56.17 kicks the bible into the villain so what you're saying is the dictionary kid has

00:01:02.12 natural immunity to stabbing I think so yeah based on

00:01:05.18 stepped oh we're tired it's the whole thing with knives

00:01:09.11 I missed uh does Eric still do his previously on for us to listen to

00:01:13.16 I I forgot to record now I'm gonna record Eric what happened last time you

00:01:18.23 were recording I am now the last episode was 108. I wasn't here

00:01:23.07 so I'm going off of nick's notes uh there are a lot of them yeah

00:01:27.16 you would have wow wow what a shock I can't believe that no way

00:01:32.23 uh talked about Geoff listening to episode 107 talked about clip paranoia

00:01:37.23 talked about the tuxedo tuxedo [ __ ]

00:01:40.07 stick groan tubes meow wolf spelling bees and what you actually call a group

00:01:44.13 of podcasters this is episode 109 take it away we've got Eric telling us what

00:01:49.16 happened last week when he has no idea and jack I feel guess what happens

00:01:55.14 didn't didn't we bleep that one thing that he said uh I don't know

00:01:59.22 I did the tuxedo thing yeah didn't we bleep the tuxedo

00:02:03.00 yeah we did we bleeped originally because we wanted to do it but then in

00:02:08.02 last week's episode we talked about it have we had do we have any update on the

00:02:11.13 tuxedo or do we have a Texas tuxedo uh we can get a tuxedo but the tuxedo no

00:02:16.15 I don't I don't have any update right now when when is that for auction uh

00:02:20.21 like five days from now oh we better get on it hello and welcome to another

00:02:25.14 episode of the F**kFuckFacePodcast my name is Geoff Ramsey uh with me as always Gavin

00:02:31.14 free Andrew panton uh on the ones and the zeros uh nick and Eric

00:02:36.02 this is episode 109 of season four year three volume one

00:02:42.17 Gavin I already asked the other two but let me ask you does my voice sound at

00:02:47.13 all different or weird to you uh bit maybe a bit more nasal ah [ __ ] I knew it

00:02:52.11 all right hold on a second um Andrew if it happens five days from now that means

00:02:56.16 the next episode hasn't come out yet I mean that means it's out and that means

00:03:00.19 people will be able to snipe us for it I don't um maybe my math is wrong I'll

00:03:05.20 have to look it soon it might be important it is very I've

00:03:09.00 been pushing this for weeks I would argue that I'm the one that has held

00:03:11.23 this with the most important but you went you did a whole spiel last week

00:03:14.23 about how it already would have happened and blah blah blah it's possible that I

00:03:18.23 did the math wrong in the moment that's very possible and if so please don't

00:03:23.09 snipe us but this had already come out after it doesn't it's pointless what is

00:03:27.00 even the point of this conversation no there's no correcting here no look

00:03:30.16 telling them to do something in this episode is pointless but you talked like

00:03:34.16 it's up to us now whether to cut it from the last one as well can a man not make

00:03:40.02 a mistake Gavin I made a mistake the time was incorrect what do you mean

00:03:45.01 what do you I don't I don't understand what's happening right now I thought

00:03:48.13 you're mad at me because I'm allowing them to snipe us but we're still not

00:03:52.02 even on the field we don't even know if we have a clearance to land they can't

00:03:55.11 snipe what's not there we might not be there yet you utter fool I'm saying yeah

00:03:59.05 it's still in our hands you haven't dropped the ball yet you're still in the

00:04:02.18 process of dropping it what are we talking about I feel like Eric brings up

00:04:07.14 a good point we are a time travel podcast so uh

00:04:11.05 Andrew what don't you understand I thought you were saying that I said it

00:04:15.01 if it's five days from now the episode oh no never mind I've I worked it out

00:04:19.02 we're good we're good we're okay we're good when's the auction

00:04:22.09 uh five days from now I think maybe that's when the episode comes out though

00:04:26.13 yeah but it's 8 a.m the auction's at 8am there's no way the amount of people

00:04:30.03 that'll listen 8am is that a Wednesday or two the podcast comes out at 3 a.m

00:04:36.00 technically well what day what day is five days from now um where's Friday.

00:04:45.14 I think it might be Tuesday that's limited only first people can listen at

00:04:50.21 that point so you mean the most devoted fans oh

00:04:54.23 you know that's one way to phrase it the most rabid of comment leavers and uh

00:05:00.04 regulation listeners I think we'll be okay my point is honestly we don't even

00:05:04.08 have a clearance to land I'm not worried

00:05:06.13 about getting sniped if we're not on the battlefield we need to be able to be on

00:05:08.06 the battlefield that's my concern so well this has already happened at this

00:05:12.01 point so what you're talking about is we're going to try and bid on the tuxedo

00:05:16.19 from the tuxedo but the auction is the same day an

00:05:20.08 episode comes out where we can talk about getting the tuxedo from the tuxedo

00:05:24.11 so we could be in a massive bidding war with regulation listeners we could be

00:05:28.19 but we we don't even have a clearance to land yet so I think we need to relax on

00:05:32.13 that can we do it I don't know what part I

00:05:35.15 don't know what you think changed in the last three minutes

00:05:40.08 like what do you think just out of curiosity what do you think happened

00:05:45.00 from the last time I was asked can we do this do you think it's right now five

00:05:49.18 days from now or what do you think happened I don't

00:06:04.23 cut him some slack yeah but we still need to decide whether we

00:06:10.06 cut it for forget it I've done no no let me know ask me again about that 15

00:06:14.11 minutes to see if anything changed from three minutes ago you got it man that's

00:06:18.08 a great point gav I think you're right we do have to make the decision but we

00:06:22.10 have some time to play with it we have another

00:06:24.12 what 45 minutes of this podcast let's punt it

00:06:27.13 so that future us can deal with it current us take a load off let's not

00:06:31.10 bother with it anymore all right chill out episode what are you talking about

00:06:35.00 uh well I think we're talking about the tuxedo

00:06:39.03 we're talking about knives I asked is every knife serrated I didn't know what

00:06:43.08 serrated means before you joined I was learning about that because I hear like

00:06:48.06 a serrated edge um do you feel like there's too many words to describe an edge

00:06:52.10 uh well what others describe like I don't know I feel like serrated

00:06:58.00 corrugated it's all just like wibbly corrugated well cargo it is like

00:07:02.15 what what is a corrugated edge well it's not really an edge but it's

00:07:06.04 more of just like how metal is or how like cardboard isn't it it's like a

00:07:11.16 bubbly up and down I love it I love that

00:07:14.19 your whole thesis was do you think there are too many ways to describe an edge

00:07:20.12 and then you listed serrated and something that's never associated with

00:07:24.17 an edge yeah I guess it is always the entire thing through you would never

00:07:28.18 just corrugate an edge yeah you know what I'm fine with the amount of wood

00:07:34.04 I mean you've got dull you've got serrated you've got jagged you've got

00:07:39.13 sharp uh rusty and that's about it

00:07:42.23 that play Russ wells rusty is like an effect on the whole thing I guess it

00:07:48.02 could be a rusty edge I feel like that's the thing I've heard it sounds like a

00:07:52.11 wrestling move like the rusty edge the top rope hit him with the rusty edge

00:07:58.06 rusty edge sounds like a wrestler yeah just is it edge just like out of

00:08:02.00 out of work edge is that his alter ego rusty edge yeah I read the funniest

00:08:06.20 comment on the last podcast from uh Anya 888

00:08:11.05 said comment lever here just want to say this is probably my most paused podcast

00:08:17.01 due to needing to laugh thank you also on another note is there a program for

00:08:21.04 re-becoming a regulation listener like born again regulation listener I like

00:08:25.09 the idea of a comment leaver wanting to somehow scrub the fact that they've left

00:08:30.02 a comment and whether there's an official program to re-enter regulation

00:08:34.19 listener I think it's so interesting that comment

00:08:37.19 lever has such a negative association with them when it's not at all a

00:08:41.12 negative thing yeah apparently especially considering now that just an

00:08:48.00 a [ __ ] human to human conversation is a comment apparently so it's like every

00:08:54.15 every interaction you've had with another human being in your entire life

00:08:58.08 makes you a comment leaver so I don't know why people would be so freaked out

00:09:01.12 about being comment leavers I can't stand my [ __ ] voice

00:09:03.19 no it's different though Eric had a point it is weird to just go out of your

00:09:06.18 way and leave a comment on other com content but you know I'm saying that

00:09:10.20 from being one so I think it's fine I turned out all right

00:09:14.03 did you yeah I mean you know a variety of edges I think you turned out great

00:09:18.20 you know all the words for edges I don't think he does I think he knew

00:09:23.03 one word for edge and then he needed corrugated metal

00:09:25.19 I think he was the worst in that regard well my favorite part about that is is I

00:09:29.16 had no idea what corrugated mean and he revealed that it wasn't an edge he could

00:09:33.10 have just kept it going like the fact I would have never challenged them you

00:09:37.01 could have told me anything I'd have no idea I could have lied to you about

00:09:40.21 edges oh you could have absolutely had I don't know what corrugated is do you

00:09:44.10 no I have no clue not even the slightest thing you have corrugated metal and

00:09:47.22 you'll see I know I told such a great lie yesterday that makes me so happy uh

00:09:52.15 we're talking about uh thanksgiving and Canada has a different thanksgiving uh

00:09:57.12 than america it's in October as opposed to November and uh they asked like oh so

00:10:02.08 like are there any traditional Canadian norms and I just said that we have goose

00:10:06.17 instead of turkey every year and instead of mashed potatoes it's like yam mashed

00:10:10.21 potatoes and they we're all in on this they're convinced that Canada people eat

00:10:14.21 goose every every year it makes me happy that that's just what

00:10:18.06 they're going to think until they're challenged by it can you eat moose I

00:10:22.10 feel like that would be a really tough meat to eat oh there you go Andrew

00:10:27.09 just posted some like a tin corrugated metal that's corrugated

00:10:31.22 okay it's got waves got it so if it has waves it's corrugated yeah awesome I I

00:10:36.21 just read what Eric wrote above that is that a recent comment when did he write

00:10:41.09 that he just wrote it I read it just now Eric has a tuxedo update go ahead

00:10:45.09 we have approval

00:10:48.02 there are caveats and details that we need to get into later oh but we are

00:10:54.19 approved for what's up credit limit well that's

00:10:59.03 that's what we got to get into Andrew said that it takes six days to get

00:11:03.05 approved on the website so we need to get get going on that I assume Eric you

00:11:07.13 go for it with the credit card and the ability and what is the estimated uh

00:11:11.23 price I believe it was 2000. They estimated going for two thousand dollars

00:11:15.15 two to three thousand I feel like a lot of the time they massively underestimate

00:11:19.12 well I think it depends on the thing because I was doing some research I was

00:11:23.07 looking at other things and they had like a zoolander two auction and so many

00:11:27.06 of the items didn't have a bid on them like only a handful did I don't think

00:11:30.18 the tuxedo from the tuxedo is going to be that high demand well there's also

00:11:33.23 the buyers premium which is like a percentage on top of this final sale so

00:11:37.18 you got to remember that dude shut up shut up about this stuff the only

00:11:42.19 people that are going to be buying a tuxedo from the tuxedo are face

00:11:46.16 regulation listeners or comment leavers I'm convinced I don't think that there's

00:11:50.14 a enough of a large tuxedo tuxedo following out there maybe it may be

00:11:54.18 somebody who wants to like wants to back

00:11:56.12 door into a versace suit and this is how they're going to do it but that's I

00:12:00.00 can't imagine people are lining up to get their hands on it

00:12:04.04 oh I bet it does none of this stuff it does none of the stuff that pretends

00:12:09.12 to do in the movie I guarantee you oh definitely not and it has giant holes in

00:12:13.21 the back for a harness it's great I don't think a caveat has ever been fun

00:12:18.12 nobody's been and there's a caveat free pizza like it's always there's it's

00:12:23.12 terrible you never want to hear that there's a caveat you want like a

00:12:27.03 a positive caveat I want like a little twit yeah caveat could just be like a

00:12:31.18 little positive twist but it's never used that way

00:12:34.16 there's one exception all of the drinks are free one little caveat one

00:12:38.09 unexpected twist this talking about like serrated and

00:12:41.19 learning things I had a thought yesterday and I don't know how this

00:12:45.17 works I don't know how thoughts work well I know how thoughts work I have

00:12:49.11 plenty of those uh glasses I never I had an association of that

00:12:54.17 glasses people wear and drink glasses I assume

00:12:59.22 are made of glass of the same glass with some differences I would also assume

00:13:04.23 could you have prescription drink glasses

00:13:08.12 could you have the prescription of your glasses be drinkable glasses yes is that

00:13:14.15 possible yes it's yeah that's the thing that could exist I can't imagine why not

00:13:20.02 I don't understand the question well because there's gla you have glasses you

00:13:25.11 wear yeah and then people are like give me I I need a glass

00:13:29.12 for a drink so you're saying a wearable pair of glasses that are like shot

00:13:34.12 glasses no just like glasses if you look through it

00:13:36.21 if you look through the glass it's the same prescription as what you wear

00:13:40.22 yeah that makes total sense to me yeah but from how close doesn't it depend on

00:13:44.13 it the distance from your eye does it I don't know I also don't know I'm asking

00:13:49.16 these questions does anybody wear glasses

00:13:52.11 I'm supposed to but I just choose not to I'm just talking about Eric

00:13:56.21 does it matter how close to your eyes the glasses are well yeah because

00:14:01.14 there's like the the lenses are like a little bit

00:14:05.12 rounded and like they sit on your face a certain way so

00:14:10.19 yeah like yeah like if you ever look through a magnifying glass and then you

00:14:15.03 pull it away from you and it sort of like inverts and goes the other way it's

00:14:18.20 like okay so what if the glass the cup or the glass well well it's not a cup

00:14:23.05 and I would never touch a glass but for the purposes of this

00:14:27.14 you take the glass it's just like a like

00:14:27.14 a normal pint glass but on the inside uh on the bottom where you would set it

00:14:32.15 down in the ground it's concave a little bit so you can like put it up to your

00:14:36.19 eye you just put it approximately to where your eye would be and it functions

00:14:42.00 as glasses I think that could hunt in the underneath of it not down it

00:14:45.17 or yeah or through the side maybe even yeah the side or the bottom is what I

00:14:50.12 was thinking the side yeah because that could be useful for like

00:14:53.20 reading a menu you know like you could be like oh I don't need glasses I'm just

00:14:57.16 gonna hold.

00:15:04.07 [Laughter]

00:15:06.21 I have absolutely dreadful long distance vision but I just never wear glasses

00:15:12.06 because I feel like I'm only inconveniencing myself and the

00:15:16.15 inconvenience of wearing glasses it's annoying it's annoying for how my

00:15:22.04 nose is my unbreakable nose does not hold glass as well

00:15:24.19 so I just go glassless and I can't see anything at a distance but up close if I

00:15:29.14 was a a near-sighted person I think that's the term for it and you can't see

00:15:34.15 or is it I feel like shot glasses are the way to

00:15:37.16 go there because you could actually wear them as a pair of glasses on the front

00:15:41.08 of your face and I just googled it and I can't see that anyone's invented that

00:15:45.04 yet I don't but why would you want that you could take them off your face and do

00:15:49.03 shots if you wanted oh but then you could get like alcohol in

00:15:53.02 your eye that seems like a bad idea like the traces of it yeah no

00:15:57.19 dangerous could be on the other side and also alcohol is uh sterile right just

00:16:01.23 clean your eyes oh it's the other way okay now I'm on board this is the only

00:16:06.21 problem is if it rains you're gonna have a real issue [Applause]

00:16:11.16 [Laughter]

00:16:13.13 That's a real problem on a rainy day you

00:16:15.08 need to always have an umbrella with you at all times just don't risk

00:16:22.08 what's that in the sky I can't look I wore my wrong glasses today

00:16:27.09 I can't risk it I'll wear my shot glasses today I can't look

00:16:31.11 I can't I got a little smudge on my glass I just need to look up for a

00:16:36.10 moment hopefully there's a drizzle I'd love to clean these oh man

00:16:41.10 this guy is your dishwasher.

00:16:45.01 I hope somebody makes those oh would've been a good uniform if we were

00:16:50.15 in our pitching phase oh yeah we could you know hold on to that uh by the way

00:16:55.12 that's about being uh copy written right now tm registered and we're filing for

00:17:00.03 the patent for it right now over at uniform don't worry about it don't get

00:17:03.06 your grubby little hands on it outside of uniform industries we're taking care

00:17:07.05 of it uh we speaking of stuff where we were

00:17:10.12 I wanted to make that we're probably not gonna make I thought it would be really

00:17:14.01 funny to make a vibe inspector shirt but everybody reminded me pretty quickly

00:17:17.17 that it just sounds like one of those like spring break female body inspector

00:17:20.20 shirts and so I guess we're not going to do it totally talk about that last time

00:17:25.03 I think we did well we'll just cut this then

00:17:28.21 oh no we can't cut it I didn't remember that it's gonna no you gotta keep it in

00:17:32.15 oh yeah I believe that's not your fault Geoff that's eric's fault he didn't recap

00:17:36.04 enough yeah yeah it wasn't a breakthrough yeah I'm so hey Geoff I'm so sorry hey

00:17:42.07 man that's okay let's not make the shirt though

00:17:47.14 because we what the vibe inspector was in reference to a house right like

00:17:51.12 something like a home inspector yeah I really I feel like but maybe that's just

00:17:55.06 like a culture journalist at that point is are they vibe like I feel like you

00:17:59.06 could go beyond just houses you could do music and movies and well one with a

00:18:04.10 song yeah you'd be able to branch out like a sommelier of vibes for all sorts

00:18:09.18 of scenarios vibes sommelier now that's vibe yeah

00:18:13.12 because sometimes you like you might have like a a movie watch you know like

00:18:18.04 a get-together of friends and somebody picks a bad movie and just throws the

00:18:21.14 whole vibe off it's like you can it's important to have a vibe sommelier in

00:18:27.01 certain positions I didn't see it's talking about great

00:18:30.17 vibe movies I watched the long kiss goodnight two days ago finally

00:18:35.05 one of my favorite directors ready Harlan what a [ __ ]

00:18:39.01 what a vibe about that recently too yeah

00:18:42.13 yeah he's my favorite bad director it's the Gina Davis sam jack it is right

00:18:47.15 that's great yeah yeah it's slightly changed

00:18:50.15 Larry king is in it at the end that was like an all time I was clapping at the

00:18:54.13 screen it's a great surprise you never expect Larry Dave or Larry king in the

00:18:59.14 final act um there's I think the the quiet best

00:19:02.15 moment of the movie is somebody tries to kill

00:19:05.11 the main character in her home and she's got like this seven-year-old daughter

00:19:10.12 and he shoots an rpg at her and he misses and it blows a hole

00:19:15.01 in the front of their house and Gina Davis the main character [ __ ] grabs

00:19:20.12 her daughter like she's a sack and throws her out of the house to just

00:19:25.07 avoid comments but she throws her as far

00:19:28.06 as it's like a 60-yard throw it's like a hail Mary bomb and this kid just goes

00:19:31.20 flying out the house and you don't see her again until like 40 minutes into the

00:19:35.20 movie she's totally fine she just vanishes it's like she got thrown to a

00:19:39.15 different state and she had to walk I like the idea of throwing someone later

00:19:45.03 into the movie like she was in 20 minutes and threw her into 40 minutes.

00:19:50.04 [Laughter]

00:19:51.06 It's a terrible good movie it's so bad it's it's so dumb it's just wonderful

00:19:56.02 another hit another they do some weird things I

00:19:59.08 think I haven't seen it since I saw in the theater but I remember really

00:20:02.08 enjoying it was there some ice was like ice scene or ice skating or something

00:20:06.08 that's a lot of stuff yeah there is she goes skating with her daughter and

00:20:10.19 they do this really weird thing so she's like a secret agent and then she gets

00:20:14.18 amnesia yeah but for a while they pretend that she has split personalities

00:20:18.13 and that the agent is an alternate personality to what she currently has

00:20:23.11 and she can't remember what happens when she goes back into

00:20:27.20 agent mode and so like they're skating with her daughter and she falls over and

00:20:32.00 the daughter's like I'm scared and then she goes into agent mode and it's like

00:20:35.15 listen you [ __ ] you're gonna [ __ ] get

00:20:39.07 up and you're never gonna fall again you worthless sack of just human child

00:20:44.12 uselessness and then she like I don't even know what I said like she's in a

00:20:49.09 tree house later she comes back and the daughter went to soldier

00:20:52.23 she was yeah it's a great example it's terrible don't you wish you could

00:20:57.16 get away with that in real life what do you mean like just just

00:21:01.14 just berate somebody and then five minutes later go I have no idea what

00:21:05.16 your dog is that was not me I don't I don't know like even in the

00:21:09.16 context of the movie it's not like the void of consequences it's the

00:21:13.08 implication is like my daughter [ __ ]

00:21:16.10 hates me and I don't know why I don't know what I did

00:21:19.00 your kids are gonna hate you regardless for something

00:21:23.05 that's a fair point might as well give you a reason it's a tragedy

00:21:27.18 but that would be if you're looking for as I'm not going to claim to be a vibe

00:21:31.20 sommelier but if you need a dumb action movie watch that I feel like it's kind

00:21:35.22 of obscure at this point long kiss goodnight pretty good

00:21:39.12 yeah pretty good dumb action would you throw it into our mvp tuxedo pile well

00:21:44.11 no I don't think yeah I don't think it's too bad yeah like

00:21:48.04 plus we have don't forget day of the dolphin or whatever or dolphin yeah we

00:21:53.00 just keep adding this they can't wait for us to actually watch days of dolphin

00:21:56.07 thunder apparently have to buy something from each of these movies afterwards

00:22:00.21 anyway so we can't watch too buddy oh that'd be so [ __ ] cool to own the

00:22:06.06 skateboard that the monkey road in mvp2

00:22:09.07 so collectible so can Andrew is this a point where we can talk about that thing

00:22:12.10 that you and I were discussing yeah absolutely I think that's fair yeah so

00:22:15.18 you could have brought it up last time we had an idea well I didn't want to I

00:22:19.12 don't well we had an idea for a fun thing to do uh Gavin

00:22:24.06 and I wanted to present to you uh so like when we go and do uh

00:22:28.23 well if we ever do like live shows or maybe not even for that just as its own

00:22:32.07 thing I feel like what we do at face is we collect hilarious stories of funny

00:22:37.16 things that we encounter or that we discover around the world like busy is a

00:22:41.13 great example here we got a hockey player who was traded for a bus right it

00:22:46.17 doesn't get any funnier than that billy ripken and the Facebook uh

00:22:50.12 baseball bat yada yada yada all that uh and we were thinking wouldn't it be cool

00:22:55.00 if we could display that in some way and

00:22:56.20 that like almost like a ripley's believe it or not but what if we called it a

00:23:01.22 face believe it because why not and then right

00:23:09.05 because why not right because we're not trying to lie to you

00:23:13.16 we have to gain by this and we create it's like a little mini art gallery

00:23:18.00 museum that we can take with us and set up and it's got like the tuxedo is is

00:23:21.20 the main thing right you go and Andrew was even saying we could have like a

00:23:25.01 little uh we could even have like a little gift shop at the end and you can

00:23:28.15 buy a shirt that just has a picture of a tuxedo on it that says I saw it

00:23:32.15 and treat it like a really big deal and then we could do like I could project

00:23:36.15 until I can build it I could project like the

00:23:38.23 uh don Pedro project up on the wall with

00:23:42.15 the projector and we could have like all the funny little weird foibles and

00:23:46.06 oddities that we amassed uh and that we invent over time and just really

00:23:50.08 celebrate it in this museum setting and then charge people like 50 cents to come

00:23:54.17 in or something believe it why not you have just created my new favorite

00:24:00.02 part of this Geoff the concept of having like a tour guide

00:24:03.03 tell stories yeah like the attitude of like [ __ ] off if you don't I don't give

00:24:06.18 a [ __ ] what you don't believe this [ __ ]

00:24:08.15 You I don't care [ __ ] leave then we're not trying to lie to [ __ ] what

00:24:12.12 does that mean I gained nothing by this lie why would I

00:24:15.10 lie about this is our reputation yeah I love this this is great anyway we just

00:24:19.10 thought that would be we're just amassing so many funny little things

00:24:22.11 like someday maybe we could get a piece of the bus and then we could put it up

00:24:26.04 on uh like on a pedestal and then have the

00:24:28.19 story and you could get like a little put headphones on and listen to Andrew

00:24:32.13 tell the bussy story or have an aggressive tour guide to explain it to

00:24:35.12 you I never even considered that bus might still be out there that bus

00:24:39.11 probably exists in some form somewhere dude I will subtract that bust I was

00:24:43.15 thinking along similar lines I was watching uh the prices right the other

00:24:47.12 day with Emily not like new prices right

00:24:49.12 with drew Carey but like an old ass like

00:24:51.17 80 it was like 83 with uh there's like a prices right channel that's always got

00:24:57.09 it on on tv and with bob barker was when he was still old even in like 1980

00:25:03.04 phenomenal uh it's in some ways he looked older in 1983 than he did in

00:25:07.18 happy gilmore I don't know how he did that uh but anyway uh and you see people

00:25:13.16 win like a Pontiac fiero and then you think like

00:25:16.19 is that still out there like is somebody still driving around uh that award

00:25:21.16 vehicle is somebody still using a jet ski or a bedroom set or an electric

00:25:26.11 toothbrush probably not but you know or like

00:25:29.10 lawn furniture or you know what I mean or like a hot tub surely something

00:25:34.18 somebody won on a game show in like 1987

00:25:37.19 is still is still in use and turned out to be like

00:25:41.06 the best winning ever you can't throw away something that you want on

00:25:44.15 television unless it's like a built-in kitchen or something like that dude I

00:25:48.16 think I think almost all of that stuff goes away pretty quickly I think people

00:25:53.02 get rid of it almost immediately I also feel like isn't there a thing

00:25:57.01 where you have to pay for like you have to pay taxes you have to pay the taxes

00:26:00.20 on it immediately to get it so I wonder how many of those are like you can

00:26:04.13 either have this hot tub or a prize amount of this value like it's a very

00:26:09.03 American thing to pay tax on a price I think it's the same lottery isn't it

00:26:13.01 whereas yeah an English lottery is just you get a load of money I think it's

00:26:17.03 like it's probably similar to like I read this a few years ago so I don't

00:26:21.09 know if it's still true but um on hell's kitchen that uh Gordon ramsay

00:26:24.23 tv show where he you know they people compete to be an apprentice and then you

00:26:28.23 get to be a head chef at one of his restaurants around the world

00:26:33.09 I think I I think I read this around like maybe season 12 or 13 that uh no

00:26:37.08 one had ever actually done the job like it always fell through every time

00:26:42.21 because of visas or because of like arrest records or because

00:26:46.13 just like the Gordon ramsay team didn't respond and just like dropped it like

00:26:50.14 people get the prize money but they never actually get to do the other part

00:26:54.04 of the prize which makes me think that probably most game shows and award shows

00:26:57.05 and all those things are largely [ __ ]

00:27:01.03 it's terrible yeah like oh you're gonna go be the head chef

00:27:05.20 at Gordon ramsay steakhouse in lake Tahoe no you're not you're going to get

00:27:10.12 150 grand and maybe you get out to go out there for two weeks but yeah the

00:27:15.09 idea of winning a job is comical in itself it is 100 winning 100

00:27:20.02 it's a I'm sure a lot of people are probably

00:27:22.07 faced with it too they're like say what now I I wanted to be on tv I didn't want

00:27:27.01 to actually move across the country I got a kid in school you know but uh

00:27:32.03 but yeah so I think I would love to know if any comment leaver or regulation

00:27:36.05 listener who has a family member who ever won something on a television show

00:27:40.08 are they still using it do they still have access to it yeah kind of like

00:27:44.08 where are they now but just like where is it now where is it yeah

00:27:48.05 speaking of winning a job Richard Branson tried to do his own version of

00:27:52.05 the apprentice in like the early thousands and I loved it it was

00:27:55.21 ridiculous or it was like all these executives and somebody's gonna become

00:28:00.12 some sector of virgin or something like they're gonna be high up in the company

00:28:04.12 and it would be like okay so to prove this you're gonna have to walk between

00:28:08.14 two floating air balloons and we're this is gonna prove that like you're tough

00:28:12.12 and like you're you're good under pressure like it was these physical

00:28:16.06 challenges that had nothing to do with business weirdly constructed to be like

00:28:20.11 no this is how actually this reflects into the business world you want to sit

00:28:25.05 on an art board do a back flip yeah and so they get to the finale and

00:28:29.16 he's like congratulations you've won but

00:28:33.16 there's a twist the prize amount is half a million dollars I have this coin we

00:28:38.10 can flip a coin and if you guess what side it will land on you will get one

00:28:43.07 million dollars or you can just take the current prize

00:28:47.09 money as this if you if you you flip and it's wrong you lose everything or you

00:28:51.11 can double your money essentially take the money

00:28:54.04 and the guy like they went to a commercial break to try to build tension

00:28:57.19 like this is like a 15 minute he was talking to other contestants about it

00:29:01.15 they really built it up and then he's like you know what like I really

00:29:04.12 appreciate obviously a million dollars is awesome but it's just too much to

00:29:08.13 risk and then he said no and Richard Branson was like you're a genius you

00:29:13.08 passed the final test if you would have said yes you would have lost everything

00:29:17.16 because it's important to know in business when you should and shouldn't

00:29:21.01 take like it was a complete [ __ ]

00:29:23.00 twist I always wondered if he said yes like would the show just end with no

00:29:26.16 winner because he designated he beat somebody else or would they reshoot it

00:29:30.20 Richard Branson would have said you just passed the test to truly succeed in

00:29:34.23 business you have to be fearless you have to take risks whether you win or

00:29:39.20 lose this coin flip it shows that you've got the balls and the moxie to be a ceo

00:29:43.23 or whatever it was designed to win this just it was ridiculous there's a 20

00:29:48.01 minute thing that they built up and had no point to it what would you have done

00:29:51.22 I think I definitely would have flipped the coin almost undeniable really well

00:29:57.05 okay let me reflect let me change this prior to when we flipped coins on this

00:30:00.20 show and I went one for like 32 I probably would have flipped in this

00:30:05.03 world in which we've done that now no way yeah I wouldn't if I were you

00:30:09.11 no I'm not gonna flip I mean going from zero to half a million is almost the

00:30:14.01 same as going from zero to a million yeah that's the it's the worst there's

00:30:18.06 some other reality show I watch where at

00:30:20.08 the end they could win a million dollars or risk it all and everybody like would

00:30:24.18 risk it all or I guess the first guy risked it all and he's like yeah I'm

00:30:27.22 doing this for my family so my kid can go to college and he was barely off and

00:30:32.01 he got nothing like it turned really depressing the game show it's like

00:30:35.14 supposed to be a fun watch people win money and seeing people lose large

00:30:38.16 amounts getting caught up in the moment was devastating yes especially president

00:30:43.11 his kid wasn't gonna go to million dollar college like

00:30:46.12 yeah you know what I mean yeah that sucks if we if we pretended to do the

00:30:51.18 coin flip now and you picked correctly would you be annoyed uh

00:30:56.00 just that it wasn't real well what do you mean like if we were like do the one

00:31:00.10 yeah like Eric flip the coin now you call it Andrew for a million dollars do

00:31:04.03 you think do you think you'd get it I think I would get it I'm feeling pretty

00:31:07.12 strong Eric do you have a coin Gavin Gavin you're British can you be Richard

00:31:11.05 Branson oh eric's yeah it's the thing okay we

00:31:14.23 have a feed I hope you're rolling on this uh watching

00:31:18.13 Gavin do you want to do all the britishisms of it like

00:31:22.05 all the patter and then tell me when to flip

00:31:25.07 yeah all right Andrew uh you got half a million one a million you got flip a

00:31:30.09 coin over to okay uh tails I'm gonna go with tails it's good

00:31:34.15 tails it's always tails this is heads why'd you

00:31:38.23 have that coin because it's from some other time we flipped coins

00:31:43.22 there was another thing in the show where we flipped coins yes it's tails

00:31:48.19 it's a bird the other one's jfk it's a real point

00:31:52.00 it's a real I'm going to catch it and then flip it over on my hand yeah

00:31:55.23 okay okay I'm just it's for you so I'm excited yeah I appreciate it no and

00:31:59.11 you're pre-calling heads you're not calling it in the air interesting I'm

00:32:02.21 calling tails I think you call tails that's that's what it tails

00:32:06.06 Geoff please confirm that he called tails Geoff you have to say that he called

00:32:07.14 tails and then we can do this he called tails I wasn't paying attention but I'll

00:32:12.13 all of you pay more attention than I was apparently

00:32:16.10 okay here we go okay he's flipping the coin he catches the coin

00:32:21.01 what is it what is it is it it's heads oh okay well see I was trying to I was

00:32:25.15 subliminally trying to get you to go ahead as I just you know double can we

00:32:29.01 do double or nothing Richard could we do double or nothing

00:32:32.01 because I really actually in the show you've been sort of I could really see

00:32:35.14 about business I don't even have a plane to get home

00:32:47.16 and I'm still just on the premises trying to leave no money just stuck there

00:32:53.07 can I have the coin for bus fare oh that was a really good Richard

00:32:58.02 Branson Gavin thanks yeah I really pulled that one out I always forget what

00:33:02.06 a natural actor you are [Laughter]

00:33:05.09 [Applause]

00:36:33.23 he's in space now right Richard Branson he's one of the space guys right now

00:36:38.11 well not like right now but I feel like he was one of the I feel like since like

00:36:42.06 the mid thousands he was like I'm going to space we're going to have space

00:36:46.19 travel is that a thing yeah okay you can just

00:36:50.12 go to space through Richard Branson I mean if you're a billionaire you get to

00:36:54.17 go to space yeah I feel like I would have to go on his airline before I

00:36:59.12 trusted him to take me into space I wouldn't trust you like you know how

00:37:03.03 many billionaires die in like a helicopter crash it's just even more

00:37:06.14 risky than that is it more than there are words for edges to describe edges

00:37:11.22 because if it's the same measurement we got like one I will say okay

00:37:16.21 to be fair to billionaires and helicopter crashes

00:37:19.13 they do I I think you're right like super rich people die in helicopter

00:37:23.20 crashes more but it's also because they take

00:37:27.12 like incalculably more helicopter rides than we do

00:37:30.05 that's true like if you take 10000 like

00:37:33.14 if you take a helicopter ride four times a day every day I mean yeah eventually

00:37:38.05 maybe you're gonna crash but I I think that the percentage is probably about

00:37:41.04 the same yeah I'm sure statistically it's safer than a car but you just it's

00:37:45.14 just how the rich die a lot yeah unfortunately is it is it how they die a

00:37:51.07 lot I don't I don't I don't know if that's statistically accurate also

00:37:55.10 it's the only version of let's be fair to billionaires that I can get behind

00:37:59.05 Geoff when you when you first open that as a me like what are we [ __ ] talking

00:38:02.20 about then you're like helicopter crashes I'm not saying they're good

00:38:05.17 people or anything I'm just saying they fly in more helicopters than we do so

00:38:09.03 they have a higher chance you're gonna notice more billionaires

00:38:11.17 crashing just because they're the only ones taking the helicopter rides when

00:38:14.21 was the last time you rode in a helicopter uh I three weeks after Kobe

00:38:19.16 Bryant died um Emily and I were on vacation in Hawaii

00:38:24.12 and the hotel we were staying at had the magnum pi helicopter you could rent it

00:38:29.20 for uh helicopter rides and so uh we rented it and then they were like for

00:38:35.01 extra money have I never told this story no no

00:38:38.15 oh okay well [ __ ] let me tell it then let me I hadn't prepared it but um

00:38:43.17 so Emily and I are staying at this uh it's actually at the place where they

00:38:47.00 where they did forgetting Sarah Marshall I think if I'm remembered correctly uh

00:38:52.19 and at this place uh they have helicopter rides and I

00:38:57.07 found out later that Emily had been uh navigating as far away from the

00:39:02.00 helicopter rides as possible every time we went anywhere without me knowing it

00:39:06.19 because she was terrified I would see the helicopter and want to take a

00:39:10.07 helicopter ride because she definitely did not want to I found I found that out

00:39:14.00 about a month ago this was like the reverse of swans yeah it was like the

00:39:17.17 reverse of swans so apparently she had been walking the long way around to get

00:39:22.19 to stuff so that I would never see the helipad and uh it's like I said

00:39:27.18 she just admitted that to me like a couple months ago uh this was

00:39:33.00 January or February 2019. Uh so uh one day we're renting bikes to go ride

00:39:38.03 around the beach and uh I see the I see the magnum pi helicopter and I go hey

00:39:42.21 what's that she goes oh uh that's uh that's a helicopter and I go for like

00:39:48.00 like for people and the lady at the bike

00:39:50.23 place remember him she goes oh yeah yeah you can rent the helicopter lots of

00:39:54.19 people do it it's really it's fun you go out for an hour and I went can we

00:39:59.14 could we rent the helicopter and she's like yeah yeah I can actually book it

00:40:03.05 from over here and emily's like yeah let's do it I didn't realize that on the

00:40:08.13 inside she was like dear god no so we rent the helicopter

00:40:12.14 and uh we go to get in it and they're like giving us a safety reading and

00:40:16.03 stuff and then the guy comes in and he goes yeah we're having a problem with

00:40:19.18 the new one uh well anyway we're just not gonna take it

00:40:23.03 we're just not gonna take it that's okay though because we have the old

00:40:26.21 helicopter we haven't mothballed yet uh we keep it around just for you know

00:40:29.22 these kind of instances so we haven't flown in a while but trust me it'd still

00:40:33.09 be fine and so that was not great to hear that the new helicopter wasn't safe

00:40:36.20 uh and they couldn't drive it and they they like pulled the old one out of

00:40:40.15 retirement I guess that's like one last mission

00:40:45.11 and uh and so up and a bunch of wasps come out of the room when they

00:40:50.21 when they come to us and they go all right now we can do it two ways we can

00:40:54.08 do it door's on the door's off and I go excuse me and they go

00:40:57.14 yeah we take the doors off that way you just have fresh air and I go doors off

00:41:00.15 doors off doors off doors off and I didn't even I didn't even look at him I

00:41:04.00 was just like yeah we want the doors off and then he's like yeah door's off

00:41:08.19 and they're like no problem and then they put us in this helicopter and

00:41:13.15 I buckle they you they don't buckle you and you buckle

00:41:16.11 yourself in I get in the back on the right side Emily gets in the back on the

00:41:19.17 left side and I realized that without the door because that thing's like the

00:41:22.22 magnum pi helicopter is kind of like a bubble that would the door is about 40

00:41:27.07 of the wall and uh because it's convex right um

00:41:31.03 I'd say about a third of me is hanging out of the helicopter and now I've been

00:41:36.18 on a lot of helicopters I was in the army for five years I was a photographer

00:41:41.02 I flew in helicopters constantly I would go into blackhawks all the time and

00:41:45.08 every time I would get into a blackhawk the pilot would go you ever flown in a

00:41:48.15 blackhawk before and I'd go yes many times you don't have to do the thing and

00:41:51.14 he goes I'm about to scare the piss out of you

00:41:53.23 and they go up in the air and they turn sideways and you're just hanging monkey

00:41:57.00 strapped in like looking at the ground and you go ah and they turn it right

00:42:00.12 back and then and then every helicopter pilot on earth does that uh and it

00:42:04.17 really it's really old really fast and no matter how many times you say

00:42:08.08 like it's you guys have done it before I

00:42:10.06 don't have to like it's it's everybody's it's every pilot's perverse pleasure

00:42:14.02 right so I feel pretty well versed in helicopters uh so but I'm I'm not

00:42:18.00 kidding when I feel like like a third of

00:42:20.06 my ass cheek is hanging out of the plane

00:42:23.12 and I'm not a big dude you know like I'd say from my right nipple out is outside

00:42:29.12 just just air uh so I'm like it's like I've only got one nipple in the plane uh

00:42:34.11 and I'm like that's a lot smaller than I thought it was that's kind of weird and

00:42:38.21 then I go to like find the monkey straps to go in and I'm looking around and

00:42:42.10 they're like no it's a lap belt and I look and it's just like it's like the

00:42:46.14 seat belt from a 1978 ford f-150 it's just like

00:42:51.09 and it's old and like it I swear to god it says gm on it I think like it just

00:42:56.21 looks like an old car like like if you bump it wrong it's

00:43:00.15 gonna come come apart right and I'm like where's the rest and

00:43:04.16 they're like that's all you need you're fine and I'm like this is the only seat

00:43:08.08 belt in this plane or helicopter and they're like hey you'll be fine and I'm

00:43:11.10 like figuring all this out and I look over to Emily and Emily does not look

00:43:14.15 good and I go are you okay and she goes yeah

00:43:18.02 I'm fine and then the helicopter takes off we get one foot in the air and I go

00:43:24.08 oh my god this is incredibly scary like instantly I look at Emily she's

00:43:30.00 immediately starts crying just um immediately starts crying like we're not

00:43:36.04 even we're a foot off the ground right and she's crying and I'm on the inside

00:43:42.04 crying but I look at her and I see how I see how terrified she is and I go

00:43:46.23 gotta be brave gotta be very friendly so I like eat it I just eat all my fear

00:43:52.19 and of which there is uh like a seven course meals worth of and then we take

00:43:58.06 off and then we're up in the air and we are up in the air and then it's an it's

00:44:04.00 an hour we got the hour-long one she closes her eyes and

00:44:07.14 keeps them closed for the entire hour uh that's not true I think she

00:44:12.04 opened them over pearl harbor briefly because I was like you gotta see this so

00:44:16.16 shoves them briefly saw the the crashed boats and she was like okay close your

00:44:21.12 eyes again and we then it's like it's not so bad we go

00:44:24.12 over the beach and like that's scary but it's like I can still see people on the

00:44:28.02 beach and like if I fell the sand is soft if I fall in the water that's I

00:44:31.19 probably live there but then and then we go over and we look at like go over to

00:44:35.10 like the punch bowl and you go over to you see where pearl harbor happened and

00:44:39.07 that's all very scary but it's still like you can see cars moving around and

00:44:42.23 stuff and it's like you feel you're still hanging ass out I'm still nipple

00:44:46.18 out of the plane or the helicopter right and that and it's very cold up there

00:44:50.17 even though it's hot in Hawaii and it's very windy

00:44:53.11 but when it gets really really bad is when we go to the mountains and they're

00:44:57.05 like let's go see where they filmed king Kong in Jurassic park and you're like

00:45:01.07 okay and then you're in these mountains and then you're climbing with the

00:45:04.18 mountains and suddenly the helicopter is

00:45:07.09 getting so throttled with wind that it's going like you can't see my hand right

00:45:11.04 now but it's like 10 feet to the left 10

00:45:14.06 feet to the right up down it's like it's like somebody's shaking dice and on the

00:45:19.11 we're the dice and I'm like just trying not to piss my pants out of

00:45:22.16 fear and it's like 40 [ __ ] degrees up there and freezing and it's incredibly

00:45:27.05 windy and it's wet so you're getting blasted with water in the face and it's

00:45:31.06 slippery and I'm just like trying to find anything inside the helicopter to

00:45:35.07 hold on to and there's nothing really except for like one arm thing to hold

00:45:39.18 and I'm just holding the seat belt just trying to hold it closed with my other

00:45:43.07 hand and I'm like I'm kind of going like I'm kind of crying to myself a little

00:45:48.04 bit in these mountains because it is so [ __ ] scary and we're getting just

00:45:51.22 thrown or like batted around like a cat batting a mouse around in the air did

00:45:55.09 you have a headset on so you could talk to each other.

00:46:00.00 I don't I don't remember I don't think so I we must have had headsets on yeah

00:46:04.18 because he was telling us stuff but I don't think we talked back I think we

00:46:07.20 just cried to ourselves and every once in a while I'd look over

00:46:10.20 at Emily and like touch her hand or whatever but and she would just be

00:46:14.08 sitting there just silently crying with her eyes closed and we did that for an

00:46:17.22 hour uh and then we landed and I've never been so happy to be on land again

00:46:22.00 and I don't know that I'll ever need to take another helicopter ride again but

00:46:26.04 if I do I guarantee you I will keep the doors on it is an entirely different

00:46:30.15 thing to to be nipple out of that little bubble

00:46:34.06 fifth ten thousand feet in the air over a mountain while you're getting hit with

00:46:39.03 gale storm winds I like that Emily got the visual

00:46:42.07 equivalent of go ogling aerial shot of pearl harbor yes yes

00:46:47.09 yeah but she had she had all the nausea of a real experience

00:46:51.22 oh god I don't think I want to go on one

00:46:55.01 yeah I don't think I've ever been on one and I don't I don't really have an

00:47:00.06 interest very different experience in an

00:47:03.22 enclosed helicopter versus that one that I was on

00:47:06.01 so did you book the magnum one and the magnum one didn't work or did you book a

00:47:09.23 different one and ended up in the magnum they were both the magnum one they were

00:47:14.21 both magnum so they got like a few a new magnum one

00:47:17.05 if I was gonna die in a helicopter crash I think I would want it to be in the

00:47:21.05 magnum pi helicopter totally agree totally agree totally yeah yeah I can't

00:47:25.11 think of a more iconic helicopter than the magnum

00:47:29.12 magnum that that factored into my decision making I thought uh

00:47:33.23 tragic that the Kobe thing just happened right obviously but what a better time

00:47:37.14 to ride in a helicopter than right now because every pilot has got to be extra

00:47:41.14 safe right like it's on everybody's mind so everybody's probably being really

00:47:46.08 self-conscious and conscientious and really safe with like all the protocols

00:47:49.20 and everything and and then also uh nobody dies in like tv fandom stuff like

00:47:55.01 I'm not gonna die in a mat like the mystery machine doesn't doesn't

00:47:59.22 go off a bridge and kill people right like I'll be fine

00:48:03.14 uh because it's the magnum pi helicopter and so that led me uh to make that

00:48:08.23 mistake so you're saying that billionaires do

00:48:11.17 not buy novelty helicopters that's those those are what I'm saying across

00:48:15.07 billionaires probably should they probably should be

00:48:18.02 like Eric said uh nobody died in a Batmobile like

00:48:21.00 if I was a billionaire I'd drive around in a Batmobile or an Oscar meyer weiner

00:48:24.02 car and you'd be safe forever if you could buy any movie vehicle what

00:48:28.15 would it be movie or tv show any type of vehicle could be

00:48:32.20 anything um anything that moves I'm trying to figure something that's not

00:48:37.14 the delorean does it oh yeah is it a rep like is it

00:48:40.23 from the movie or is it like does it work it's like movie works a functional

00:48:46.11 it works as how the movie works let's go with that

00:48:50.15 it's a functional version of whatever it is in the movie oh uh car from bullet

00:48:56.00 I mean I don't want to sound way too nerdy but

00:48:59.20 like wouldn't the tardis be like the perfect thing to have

00:49:04.22 it's the size of a it doesn't move much yeah but it's the size of it it moves

00:49:09.00 wherever you want to go it goes anywhere in the universe forward and back Andrew

00:49:13.01 said it has to be functional has to be functional has to work unless

00:49:16.09 you stick some wheels underneath it well you're saying it works as intended

00:49:20.10 in the movie so I assume in my world then I walk out with hey I'm not gonna

00:49:25.07 it's it's a four thousand square foot house on the inside which is lovely

00:49:28.20 in Austin good luck finding that so you just plunk it down anywhere and then I

00:49:32.23 can go anywhere in the observable universe

00:49:35.21 yeah I took it as Eric says I took it as magic exists in the scenario absolutely

00:49:39.05 I did and I don't think it's magic in doctor who I think it's science

00:49:44.04 sure what do you go with gam hmm um well if I mean for using magic I want

00:49:49.12 one of the light bikes from tron well that's also not magic that's science I

00:49:53.20 mean it's the is it hard light eric's got to change his [ __ ] answer

00:49:58.23 I just like the idea of going like riding down the motorway and no one can

00:50:03.03 come behind me [Laughter]

00:50:05.07 like no one can tailgate you ever yeah I hmm we're going different

00:50:11.11 I'm thinking like the submarine from the hunt for red

00:50:14.21 October because I just I don't know anyone that owns a submarine is it a

00:50:19.06 real submarine I assume well no I'm saying like but it's depicted you just

00:50:22.15 [ __ ] picked the tron bike what are you talking about is

00:50:26.04 I thought we'd talk about props but then

00:50:28.23 Geoff picked the tardis which is an empty wooden box

00:50:32.21 it's full of stuff on the inside I think a owning a submarine would be

00:50:37.16 fun and I don't know anyone who has a submarine that'd be it would be a great

00:50:41.23 show it'd be like oh look at what I just bought and it's just water and then

00:50:45.06 you're like pull it up if we're picking submarines I want the

00:50:49.18 one from gold member that's shaped like dr evil oh that's a great

00:50:55.03 imagine if that was functional imagine if they really built a whole sub for

00:51:00.05 gold member I want I want to change my answer I want

00:51:04.06 the spaceship that they built in the explorers out of trash cans that

00:51:08.01 actually took them to space did you guys ever see that movie when you were kids

00:51:12.02 phoenix yeah no Eric has a problem with our scenario it

00:51:16.08 just it went from what's a cool car that you think is in a movie or something to

00:51:22.00 what insane sci-fi thing do you want like this is so

00:51:27.11 man it really went in a direction I was not anticipating uh I want the tuxedo

00:51:32.10 from tuxedo that's my pick oh it's a hawk and river phoenix yeah and this is

00:51:40.19 what the spaceship looked like I would rather I would rather [ __ ]

00:51:45.12 fly in the magnum pi chopper with the doors open and take foot in that thing I

00:51:50.11 don't want to get in that thing oh you know what I would say so insecure I

00:51:54.17 would take the winnebago from space balls oh

00:51:58.04 that's because that at least has wheels that is good

00:52:01.22 and could potentially function on a real road if it wasn't I assume about a foot

00:52:08.02 long in real life I want the car from spy hunter can we go video yeah

00:52:12.11 of course yeah the rock that's a weird video they made

00:52:16.00 the second spy hunter I don't remember what the subtitle is but there's a

00:52:19.16 second spy hunter that the rock was in and they were going to make a movie

00:52:23.04 based off of the game but then the game wasn't successful enough to justify the

00:52:26.22 movie so it's like this weird movie tie-in game that doesn't have a movie

00:52:30.23 associated with huh it's very strange just want to like

00:52:34.23 early rock it's like before even I want to say he did the run down like it is

00:52:39.20 very early rock work I forgot about the rundown

00:52:42.11 rundown is maybe my favorite rock movie it's a good movie it's [ __ ] awesome

00:52:47.05 is that the one with johnny Knoxville in it no that's uh

00:52:51.16 walk tall tall yeah yeah no the rundown has Sean Liam Scott and right right

00:52:57.11 right right right rosario Dawson Sean on it's great uh Christopher watkin has a

00:53:02.17 whole monologue in that movie about oompa loompas but he didn't know what

00:53:05.18 they were when they filmed it so like he complained about the he's like what the

00:53:09.10 [ __ ] is this and they have to explain to him what an oompa loompa is

00:53:14.04 fantastic it's a great action movie [ __ ] the London knight watch the run

00:53:18.12 down if you want a dumb action movie rundown is awesome yeah yeah I've seen

00:53:22.07 it it's good not that there's a lot of competition it's the best wwe movie of

00:53:27.20 all time by a lot it's a low bar but it's very good I am

00:53:31.11 yes I hate to say it but I have sock dilemma

00:53:36.00 oh no we can't do this again gather yeah gather really [ __ ] time travel you've

00:53:42.02 come to the right place how can we help yeah I figured this is the the correct

00:53:46.15 support group for the problem but I really have annoyed that

00:53:50.16 wait time about one sec without knowing it we in the same episode we literally

00:53:56.10 flipped the coin and are now doing a sock story we had an actual coin flip

00:54:01.15 and a sock story travel pokemon this is so stupid sorry go ahead [Laughter]

00:54:09.12 we've done this before what is happening with your socks

00:54:15.20 so I bought some new socks like what a three pack

00:54:19.05 of this type of like more breathable sock uh just because it's hot I wanted a

00:54:24.16 summer sock and uh I put on this new type of sock

00:54:28.23 that I've never won before and it was phenomenal

00:54:32.18 I I really enjoyed putting it on like it went on well it feels nice to walk

00:54:37.01 around the house feels good in the shoe I thought this is a great sock

00:54:41.14 I'm gonna buy a 10 pack of these socks and I got to the point like while I was

00:54:47.12 waiting for these socks to arrive occasionally

00:54:49.21 these new socks would be in the rotation I I'd go back and forth between a new

00:54:54.06 nice fresh sock and then my old socks and I it got to the point where I was

00:54:59.12 like I always have a good day when I wear a nice new pair of socks and

00:55:03.13 it was get to the point where like I have like an okay day or a [ __ ] day on

00:55:06.23 the old socks and every time I wear a new one it was great and then the

00:55:10.21 10-pack came and this this continued I was like wow I pretty much and this is

00:55:16.01 it was subconscious at first but it actually got to the point where I was

00:55:18.23 like well I need today to go well so I'm gonna put on one of the new pairs and

00:55:23.22 this has continued to work probably for the last three or four weeks

00:55:29.12 until last week I put on a new pair and

00:55:31.18 had a [ __ ] day and I thought oh and then

00:55:34.04 I started to try and analyze it like is it because it was red like I still I'm

00:55:39.14 just in a weird it's like it's so subconscious like it's not a real

00:55:42.15 decision I'm making but now I'm avoiding the red ones and I've just I think I've

00:55:47.05 just become I've become everything I was making fun

00:55:51.11 of when it came to gym yeah cause sock who socks don't matter it's all bollocks

00:55:57.03 it's all superstition crap but I have a bad day when I wear the red

00:56:01.00 good sock but you used to have a good day when you wore the red good sock

00:56:04.19 right I just used to not notice but now that I haven't had a bad day of the new

00:56:08.08 socks I'm I'm actually picking up that pair of socks every day and putting it

00:56:11.11 back do you know what you need to do you know

00:56:13.21 what you need to do honestly you need to get rid of that pair of socks you used

00:56:17.15 up the good in those socks all the luck is gone

00:56:20.21 you think I should just spin it it was like never 15 dollars

00:56:24.05 it'll never be good for you again you're never going to enjoy them you

00:56:27.08 don't recharge that's what I've been thinking I'm like

00:56:30.17 do I just avoid this pair of socks or do

00:56:33.18 I try and cleanse the socks by basically picking like a day where I would go to

00:56:37.03 Disneyland or it's like you couldn't lose the day and put on the

00:56:42.01 kids socks like a guaranteed

00:56:44.23 what do you have oh I don't know I just feel like if there's

00:56:48.23 a day where up front you know it's gonna be an absolute corker do I put on the

00:56:54.19 bad socks and potentially tarnish the day or do I cleanse the socks of evil

00:56:59.05 your entire belief that it's impossible to have a good day with the socks like I

00:57:02.21 don't think your logic doesn't make sense yeah I don't know it's like this

00:57:05.21 works I was hoping that you guys would have suggestions that's difficult it's

00:57:09.16 like which came first chicken or the egg right like it is is the power is the

00:57:14.02 negativity of the sock does it outweigh the power of a guaranteed good day that

00:57:19.13 said this is dangerous stuff you're you're dealing with here

00:57:24.10 I mean I have a lot to go over I mean it's 14 [ __ ] dollars how how how

00:57:29.05 you can donate them yeah donate them man what's a used pair of socks

00:57:33.23 a lot of people don't yeah you can donate clothes yeah a lot of people

00:57:37.09 could use especially a pair of socks like this socks and undies were out of the

00:57:41.07 question for donation oh I don't know are they I don't know I

00:57:44.21 assume socks would be fine I mean is a bat is a good day worth more to you than

00:57:49.10 fourteen dollars I guess sorry like is it out there would you pay 14 to avoid a

00:57:55.09 a really [ __ ] day I would I think I would too that's a good point

00:57:59.14 yeah I would probably get rid of those socks they're never they're only going

00:58:02.21 to hurt you unless we come up with like a uniform cleanse bag or something

00:58:07.10 listen listen now there is that's a possibility too I like the idea of

00:58:10.13 trying to reach I know I just said it was impossible but but

00:58:14.17 I don't think anything's really impossible is there a way to like re-imbue

00:58:20.11 these socks with good sock luck I I have no idea I wouldn't even know how to

00:58:25.11 begin that I'd be open to suggestions from the

00:58:29.16 audience and I I also think it's I just enjoy it because I'm

00:58:32.16 about as skeptic as they come with all that nonsense and like yeah healing and

00:58:37.08 astrology and all that shite I like the idea that I'm now pushing for one of

00:58:42.21 one of those items to be made knowing well you're evolving [Music]

00:58:47.22 knowing you when you said so then I had I wore them and I had a bad day I

00:58:51.13 expected you to be like and that ended that [ __ ] fantasy thing that I've

00:58:55.14 been living in and instead you pivoted and said and that's why I've stopped

00:58:59.22 wearing red well like it's completely out of character

00:59:03.16 I didn't want to write off the entire pack of socks

00:59:06.14 that's yeah I spend good money on those songs I don't want to be like well

00:59:10.10 they're all tarnished is it possible is it possible it's a month thing like

00:59:16.20 maybe they're good luck in may but bad

00:59:21.22 irrelevant I don't know I don't know maybe it

00:59:24.21 matters how many days are in the month yeah or like is it an even day or an odd

00:59:30.19 day there's a lot of magics associated with that yeah you could really go at it

00:59:34.03 I think the only way to truly find out is to keep a spreadsheet and probably do

00:59:38.10 it for a year and then do like a cross-reference and analysis

00:59:42.21 yeah I don't know if Eric has any thoughts on the stock matter

00:59:47.01 uh what what you just described as something gus would do unprovoked

00:59:51.11 spreadsheet [Laughter]

00:59:54.08 yeah but he gets off sexually at that stuff I nearly fainted at the start of

00:59:59.02 your story when you said that I got a three pack of socks and I thought you

01:00:02.22 meant you bought three songs in one pack

01:00:05.03 I thought it was like we're really tired it's all connecting this is truly a

01:00:09.16 re-run no it was six sucks I was stunned when you said I got

01:00:13.20 a three pack and I was like what is going on internally I'm still recovering

01:00:19.04 from that moment uh what if you is dan around uh not this week

01:00:25.11 he'll do anything right what if you like give him made him made him wear the

01:00:30.20 socks for a day and then observe the quality of his day and then just give

01:00:34.15 him a survey at the end of the day yeah this is your day how was your day and if

01:00:38.07 it was a good day or a bad day and then that way you outsource the danger to him

01:00:42.14 uh should I feel bad if he has an awful day though I feel like I would be the

01:00:45.16 team do you give a [ __ ]

01:00:48.17 yeah I think so now I don't think you do you took too long to answer you had to

01:00:53.15 convince you had to convince yourself that you cared in front of other people

01:00:58.13 no that was like the pause said everything I appreciate the attempts
