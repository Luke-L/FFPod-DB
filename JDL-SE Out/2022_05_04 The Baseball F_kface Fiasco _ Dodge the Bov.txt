00:00:00.03 [Music]

00:00:05.05 Previously on face [Music]

00:00:17.01 hello and welcome to the 101st episode of the F**kFuckFacePodcast my name is

00:00:24.00 Geoff Ramsey and with me as always Andrew panton way up there in Canada and

00:00:29.12 everybody's favorite British wanker Gavin free

00:00:33.05 uh from uh from oxfordshire via Austin Texas how thank you uh how are you doing

00:00:39.05 fellas uh I'm good relax Andrew was saying lactating women kinks

00:00:48.00 yes yeah not cakes I thought he was saying cakes

00:00:52.08 yeah I mean it was clear after the fact but I also was just I completely botched

00:00:56.18 that it was a mess I don't know if we necessarily need to revisit the lactate

00:01:00.12 that was when you went in you were in the bunker yeah like I just botched that

00:01:04.10 immediately and I was in my own head for the rest of that episode so I thought

00:01:07.12 you said cakes and then I'm talking about like using tit milk to make a cake

00:01:11.20 and then yeah uh you you then you said your mum was

00:01:15.10 talking about sugar cookies so I thought we were still on the same page yeah I

00:01:18.19 don't know I don't know what happened I know a part of the problem is that we

00:01:22.17 only hear each other over discord so it sort of sounds like we're all playing

00:01:26.12 among us at the time but even in the when I was proofing it I didn't I still

00:01:31.18 didn't understand what you said that's fair what's the audio

00:01:34.16 I was trying to remember in the moment what I thought because cakes makes sense

00:01:38.11 to me I feel like maybe I also thought cakes

00:01:41.11 yeah it wasn't until the comment leavers

00:01:45.16 were like gavin's an idiot I was like oh it still doesn't make it

00:01:49.22 yeah that's fair it was from my perspective I started out

00:01:53.07 and I immediately [ __ ] it up in the order I wanted to do it and I'm like I

00:01:56.23 just need anyone who wants to play ball with me right now I'll take it and you

00:02:00.13 throwing you going in the desert category was like be throwing a life

00:02:04.00 preserver and I'm like I'll just take whatever we can we'll go in this angle

00:02:08.10 we gotta figure a way through this because I [ __ ] this immediately so so

00:02:14.11 what do you guys wanna talk about today

00:02:17.09 I uh I got nothing speaking of [ __ I this we could transition immediately to

00:02:24.00 [ __ ] up that happened we want to oh yeah the [ __ ] baseballs all right

00:02:29.09 let's get in to the [ __ ] baseballs I'd love to get Eric involved in this as

00:02:35.09 well what happened I'll tell you I'll tell you I'll break it down what

00:02:40.12 happened rooster teeth is a mini-headed monster we are a company of hundreds and

00:02:45.18 hundreds of people and so uh one of the frustrating things about

00:02:49.16 being an on-camera talent from time to time is that when a mistake is made

00:02:55.05 behind the scenes or there's an issue behind the scenes the talent wears it so

00:02:59.02 what happened was we released about 200

00:03:01.11 baseballs that we had hit or at least swung at uh you know the whole saga but

00:03:06.11 now they're all gone please stop looking for them don't go there it is just a

00:03:09.18 haven for snakes uh there we we've accounted for every baseball there are

00:03:13.20 zero more baseballs we've we've checked serial numbers they're all accounted for

00:03:17.22 100 of them have been recovered please do not look for more baseballs okay so

00:03:22.11 what happened was we wanted to allow people the opportunity to buy them we

00:03:26.23 knew that there'd be more people wanting to buy them than we had to sell and so

00:03:30.21 you try to be as precise as possible with that so we said at 10 a.m central

00:03:35.01 time on whatever day it was we're going to release the balls and then everybody

00:03:39.09 who wants one can come in and it's kind of like a melee I understand but like

00:03:43.02 people that want it can all like go there at the same time and and you know

00:03:46.15 try their luck recognizing that we don't have enough balls for everyone

00:03:50.12 unfortunately uh but you know I only got so there was only so much juice in my

00:03:54.12 arms there's a physical cost to this item like it makes complete sense that

00:03:58.15 it would be a limited amount of them a huge physical cost that it cost me uh

00:04:04.13 overall about about about three weeks of of of uh pain it cost me a tripod

00:04:09.23 cost Gavin a tripod yeah so it cost him some financial pain so uh

00:04:14.19 so what happens is we're not the ones that actually take the balls and put

00:04:18.18 them up on the store they have to go to our shipping uh company and then they

00:04:22.17 have to like on board them and put them into the uh into the inventory system

00:04:27.21 and then they have to be individually wrapped and all that stuff and while

00:04:31.13 that's going on they have to be added into our web store via a back end and

00:04:35.17 this is something I used to do for the first seven or about the first eight

00:04:40.06 years of the company I ran the store by myself so I understand how how difficult

00:04:44.17 and how much more work it is behind the scenes than you may realize it sounds

00:04:48.15 like you just hit a button and you go but it's really not that simple there's

00:04:52.04 a lot of linking and branching and a lot of eyes that got to be dotted and t's

00:04:55.20 have got to be crossed and so we asked them to be put up at 10 am the person

00:05:00.06 who ended up putting them in was not the person we told information gets passed

00:05:03.23 down there's a bit of a game of telephone from time to time you know a

00:05:07.06 little purple monkey dishwasher in there what essentially happened was the

00:05:10.10 process it's it's not an exact process it takes

00:05:13.08 anywhere between 10 and 15 minutes to add them to all the places that they

00:05:17.14 need to be and then publish it to the store uh

00:05:20.11 and so that they go live so the person that does it they typically start about

00:05:24.17 945

00:05:26.00 and because you know that gives them a good 15 minutes to work with and then

00:05:29.11 they just get it as close to in this instance to 10 a.m as possible what

00:05:33.20 happened in this instance is it just the process went faster than normal and so

00:05:38.09 not realizing uh that we had a hard time that department uh they just published

00:05:43.14 them early right which is like if you think about it if you're just a person

00:05:46.19 who's like whose job is to do that you're like wow I put them out five

00:05:48.19 minutes early then people have you know then they're just they're waiting for

00:05:52.23 you when you show up I don't think they understood the demand and so by about

00:05:57.00 950 uh all of the balls had been sold out so the people who showed up early

00:06:01.15 were rewarded by getting the balls because they showed up early and were

00:06:04.18 like spam and refresh so those people were were uh those early birds they

00:06:08.13 caught those worms they got those little ball worms uh and then the people who

00:06:11.20 dutifully showed up at 10 am when we told them to were like what do you mean

00:06:15.06 they're sold out what the [ __ ] and they didn't get it and they were

00:06:19.02 understandably justifiably upset as were we we were

00:06:23.04 upset because people were upset we wanted to give everybody a fair shot at

00:06:27.21 getting the balls and we felt like uh through no intentional fault of

00:06:32.07 anybody's own uh that we didn't deliver on that and so we were gutted and

00:06:37.12 frustrated and as I know the ecom department that that

00:06:40.05 uh runs this on the back end they were also disappointed now my solution to

00:06:44.10 this going forward and I have talked about this a little bit with actually at

00:06:47.12 length with Eric you by the way you guys want to see a producer producing in

00:06:53.01 action Eric was on the ball that day he was all over this all day long uh shout

00:06:57.11 out and and major kudos to Eric for doing a hell of a job trying to get to

00:07:01.09 the bottom of this and get it all worked out and get figured out what happened

00:07:04.23 and how to make sure it doesn't happen again my solution would be just to never

00:07:08.22 announce an exact time again because uh we [ __ ] it up twice and I don't want

00:07:13.20 to do it I don't know I don't want to be happy

00:07:16.10 here's here's the thing here's the thing when things like this happen I don't

00:07:19.20 really care why these things happen it's

00:07:21.14 it's upsetting but what are you gonna do belabor the point you know what I mean

00:07:26.00 all I wanna know is are we capable of doing the thing that

00:07:29.17 we initially set out to do going forward so I had a lot of

00:07:33.15 conversations with a lot of people in the e-comm team and I was assured that

00:07:38.19 going forward when we have these down to the minute drops we can

00:07:43.16 do them I found out what the limitations are I found out what the problems or

00:07:49.07 what the hiccups would be but I was assured that when we go going forward if

00:07:53.13 we wanted to do this stuff for down to the minute stuff what happened this time

00:07:58.15 won't happen again and we can do it to a precise minute the

00:08:03.08 way that we want it to me it sounds like ecom went in for pleasantries they went

00:08:08.15 in early and uh you you know I'm not a fan of

00:08:11.14 that I and hey listen I think there's a lot of people that feel like your stance

00:08:16.16 on pleasantries is 100 validated by this whole ordeal uh yeah I saw I saw a lot

00:08:21.23 of that sentiment as a fan of pleasantries let me there's a line of

00:08:25.07 pleasantries you can have too much pleasantries they were too early on the

00:08:28.23 pleasantries you can't you can't be 20

00:08:31.01 minutes early on the pleasant a five minute pleasantry that's a different

00:08:35.06 story so uh I know that there's a lot of audience members out there who are

00:08:38.19 frustrated we are also frustrated Eric has put a lot of work into making sure

00:08:42.14 that the next time we do this it'll work without a hitch and I'll tell you right

00:08:46.06 now if we [ __ ] it up a third time I'm I'm just going to eliminate the

00:08:50.08 opportunity for us to release to the minute of just like it'll be out

00:08:54.12 sometime on this day best of luck check you know like well

00:08:58.15 I'll give you like we would give you like a window like more like it'll be

00:09:03.11 like when you have to get your internet fixed and you call att or or spectrum or

00:09:07.22 whoever whoever you have in it with and they go yeah we'll be there between 8 am

00:09:11.08 and noon that'll be the new window we'll be like why would we we're gonna drop

00:09:15.14 the balls why why would we want to operate in the worst way of that your

00:09:20.12 ideas we can't operate in that the way to fix this going forward is for

00:09:26.11 us to operate like spectrum internet that's not yeah that's not a great

00:09:30.08 comparable but the Geoff's defense I went through a phase where I was super into

00:09:34.15 trying to collect like mondo posters like a long line many years ago and they

00:09:38.12 do not put specific times out there like it will release on this day at least

00:09:41.20 they didn't back then but they would always put them into the system at

00:09:45.08 around 10 a.m but they were never definitive so there's there's room for

00:09:49.00 that there's a there's a history of companies doing that I'm just saying if

00:09:52.19 we blow it again if we're if we if we strike out if we're oh for three on this

00:09:57.02 I think that we gotta reevaluate I'm willing to give another shot if we get

00:10:00.23 three strikes on our baseballs yeah but I'm absolutely willing to give

00:10:05.09 it another shot I appreciate the work that Eric did I trust the econ team can

00:10:09.00 get it right I'm just saying if we don't we got to cut our losses totally if it

00:10:13.13 happens again I won't talk about it you guys could talk about it on the show I

00:10:17.16 won't talk about it on the show because I won't have anything that we could air

00:10:22.21 like nothing that I would say would be useful so like I'm guaranteeing

00:10:27.09 that it will not happen again all right there we go so to that end we want to do

00:10:32.03 a make good we want to make it up to the

00:10:35.16 audience members who followed the letter

00:10:37.14 of the law and showed up at 959 to wait

00:10:40.11 for the clock to tick over to 10 and try to buy the balls and find out they were

00:10:44.01 not there I've already asked ecom to buy

00:10:47.11 us more balls I'm prepared to go out and

00:10:49.08 do it all over again now my initial idea my initial idea and and there's a

00:10:54.02 counter argument to that and I'd love to

00:10:55.19 and I think I think the counter argument is probably ultimately correct but I'd

00:10:59.03 like to at least hit with my initial idea was to mix it up a little bit to

00:11:02.11 make it a little different to share some of the burden on me

00:11:05.19 uh maybe I hit a hundred maybe Gavin hits 50 maybe Eric does 20 and then

00:11:10.08 maybe we mail a couple to Andrew and he can do whatever weird [ __ ] Andrew does

00:11:13.20 with stuff and then we just kind of mix it all up and then you're getting like

00:11:17.05 the potential of maybe you get a Gavin ball in blue or you get a Eric ball in

00:11:21.10 orange or a Geoff ball in black yeah different paints for different people uh

00:11:25.02 andrew's counterpoint was we can't make a new product that's

00:11:28.13 different because that's just going to make the one the people who already

00:11:31.12 bought the black hip balls want the new product as well we should there should

00:11:36.23 be parity between the product so that everybody gets the same potential ball

00:11:41.07 and I think uh as much as it pains me to say it I think he's probably right man

00:11:45.05 this is deep I think it's also a conversation that the audience could

00:11:49.02 respond to like in the comments of this like would they rather go just do the

00:11:53.03 exact same thing as like a pure make good so people who already have one

00:11:57.03 don't feel obligated to buy this one or do you want uh would you prefer

00:12:01.09 what Geoff just said of like us all having our own takes on the balls and

00:12:04.13 then doing like a second release essentially that way with a larger

00:12:08.17 volume of them we'll let the audience decide we'll kind of go by audience

00:12:13.16 sentiment after this airs uh either way we're going to in some fashion either

00:12:17.22 create ident an identical product or a newer altered product and release

00:12:22.18 another I guess two or three hundred balls out into the wild so if you didn't

00:12:27.21 get one you'll be able to to try again uh just because we want to make it up to

00:12:32.16 you because I there were I I there were there was a lot of anger out there in

00:12:36.21 the world uh and uh and I get it I get it yeah and I want to make it up I want

00:12:40.12 to make it up to every comment leaver and every regulation listener out there

00:12:43.18 like when you get beat out for something

00:12:46.08 like if it drops on time that's just how

00:12:48.19 it goes like it's it sucks like you live

00:12:48.19 with that but like when the system fails like when you feel like a bunch of bots

00:12:53.04 bought it or whatever like something went against it that sucks like that's

00:12:57.14 that's like an understandable frustration so yeah it sounds like we've

00:13:02.06 been able to figure stuff out hopefully and uh

00:13:04.15 we will we will do make it on this and depending on what the audience wants I

00:13:08.10 think just to say sincerest apologies absolutely if you showed up and felt

00:13:11.23 slighted we are going to do our absolute damnedest to make it up to you it was

00:13:16.10 very us though it was very fast it was very face but you know uh yeah yeah

00:13:21.09 uh we don't have to be so true to the letter of the show all the time

00:13:26.04 Andrew you you wanted to see he wanted to roll into something so speaking I

00:13:31.15 have a little like story to tell those that's very funny that happened to me

00:13:36.02 recently speaking of like show expenses I I filed my taxes last week

00:13:40.15 and typically whenever I I have done things for this

00:13:44.06 show because it's worked but it's weird it's a weird category thing I've never

00:13:48.21 really tried to claim what would be traditional work expenses

00:13:53.01 and so this is the first year I attempted to do so including the port a

00:13:57.14 potty so I was ner like I was like how do I

00:13:59.17 how do I submit this in like a way that makes sense that's not gonna be like

00:14:03.20 highly questioned so I thought oh I'll fancy up the wording and I called it

00:14:08.05 production equipment I listed the port a potty as production equipment on my form

00:14:13.20 I put the price amount down I put the bingo wheel down as production equipment

00:14:17.22 and I put some comic books down when we're doing research extensive research

00:14:22.02 I put all of the btf sauce orders as uh production meals I was trying to class

00:14:26.13 up everything as much as possible you should be

00:14:30.12 ex pen sing all this to the company yeah I don't know how any of this works

00:14:36.04 talk to the producer so so I put all that in

00:14:40.12 and I brought it to the person that does my taxes and I showed the forum and I'm

00:14:45.21 like so I got these I got this production stuff and they immediately

00:14:50.08 said they pointed at the port a potty and said what is this I said what do you

00:14:54.06 mean it's they're like no like I understand it says production equipment

00:14:58.15 what was the equipment and I had to say port-a-potty and the

00:15:03.11 look of shock on their like they were like they said they audibly said what

00:15:08.08 and they look so confused and I had to then explain

00:15:11.16 what it what that it was a port a potty and why it was related to the show and

00:15:15.10 that we made these mugs and it was this whole thing and then I realized oh no

00:15:19.12 she's gonna do this with all of them so then she immediately pointed to the next

00:15:23.10 one what is this production equipment and I had to just go bingo wheel didn't

00:15:27.18 question that one and they were able to move on but the embarrassment of having

00:15:33.18 to tell somebody port-a-potty and there's just a shocked look on her face

00:15:39.05 was very funny oh my god so I'm almost certainly going to get

00:15:42.14 audited I'm excited for this process and you could have just got reimbursed I

00:15:47.03 could have just got potentially yeah I don't know how any of that stuff works

00:15:50.14 as I said but we have a form I think do we yeah it's expensive yeah it's

00:15:55.11 called Eric in the Philippines yeah so I'll introduce you to the wonderful

00:15:58.20 world of concur expense sheet reporting

00:16:01.20 yeah so they made those audible noises and then welcome man enjoy yeah

00:16:07.12 well some of it to be fair like I don't the port a potty was a weird thing where

00:16:11.16 it was just something I wanted to do and I felt like it would be tough to get

00:16:14.16 approval of because it's expensive it was over a thousand dollars uh so I just

00:16:19.05 did it yeah it just feels yeah I don't know yeah that's a lot of

00:16:24.06 money for you I mean I mean just so you're aware there's no way I would have

00:16:28.05 gotten approval for over a thousand dollars for a poor party exactly

00:16:33.03 like like they're like it's just it just wouldn't have happened

00:16:36.09 sold out on mugs though like it was a valuable it was like from the moment 100

00:16:41.01 worth it we sold 1000 tiki mugs because of that

00:16:44.20 port a potty you bought it right right and you guys understand the order that

00:16:48.15 these things happen right okay just making sure okay we didn't sell the

00:16:52.03 cheeky mugs before we did the port a potty no but I came first listen it all

00:16:56.14 worked out in the end it was a clear thing it was a great idea I think it's

00:16:59.15 impossible to deny that it was a great idea ultimately what what you're doing

00:17:03.07 though what we're doing is we're building a resume of success so that now

00:17:07.16 when we go to uh I don't know the finance department and say hey we need to buy

00:17:12.22 you know this thousand dollar piece of nonsense but we promise it'll turn into

00:17:18.13 content down the road uh they'll go oh yeah well you've proven

00:17:23.11 that time and time again so uh signed off [Applause]

00:17:28.17 when you use the bathroom you always close the door behind you right you

00:20:08.17 I have another thing I need to bring up quickly uh because I should have done

00:20:12.23 this at the beginning of the show but I'm an idiot

00:20:15.06 last episode Geoff you came at me pretty pretty aggressively at the end you took

00:20:20.10 some shots my way you just [ __ ] I felt I felt I told a

00:20:24.16 good story and you're like oh god what about you you got any [ __ ] content

00:20:29.16 for this episode so I came up with a few games Geoff and one of them one of them

00:20:34.23 is sort of time sensitive are we gonna start off the next hundred

00:20:39.16 episodes with you being mad at me yeah no we're it's gonna conclude within this

00:20:44.16 one because I did a thing I came I came with the games Geoff

00:20:47.23 this is okay one this is an important thing I should have mentioned earlier

00:20:51.16 from my idea with it before you go any further can I ask you a question

00:20:55.02 absolutely did did you mail something to me no

00:20:58.10 okay just making sure because I had a fed ex

00:21:01.03 uh note on my door and if it was like for the show I didn't get it okay no but

00:21:06.08 speaking of of mailing stuff so this ties in

00:21:09.18 we got a we got a bob roll taste test potentially yeah

00:21:13.13 today by the way I've had bovrel that's exciting we could talk about that yeah I

00:21:19.12 made popsicles I have six popsicles I made a tray three of them are good things

00:21:25.07 no they're all different things there's one bob pop

00:21:28.16 in that mix now I didn't put these together so I don't know which one is what

00:21:32.21 there's six of them I will have five of them three of them

00:21:36.11 are good three of them are bad Geoff you can pick which ones I eat whenever

00:21:39.17 whenever you want to if you say a number one through six I will then pull that

00:21:43.21 one out front left is the uh the first one so front left then to the right of

00:21:48.04 it is two it'll go up from there um there's six flavors the three good ones

00:21:53.04 seven up because that was the first soda chug I did I used seven up

00:21:58.15 the second good Popsicle is coca-cola my my cold okay beverage of choice

00:22:04.00 third delicious Popsicle apple juice a big apple guy love apple juice hell yeah

00:22:09.14 is it cosmic crisp juice yeah it's not I wish it was it'd be even better the bad

00:22:13.20 three salad cream is one of them

00:22:18.12 the next bad one is bovrel as you know about and one of them is pancake batter

00:22:24.13 uh I was told Jesus I was told that one of these did not freeze at all and I am

00:22:30.12 not excited about that one so this is gonna be sort of a bottle taste test but

00:22:36.04 possibly in a true salad cream like fashion I you might not pick the Barbara

00:22:41.00 one I might completely avoid the bottle so you're gonna do five

00:22:44.21 uh yeah we're gonna do five one of these

00:22:46.16 I will not eat you can pick you just say

00:22:48.14 a number one through six at any point in

00:22:51.14 the show and then I will Eric has a good

00:22:54.17 point you should do them blind yeah well I don't know what they are already

00:22:58.06 they're already blind to me look what what I'm saying is that say Geoff

00:23:02.00 says three okay you pull out three but you don't look you like close your eyes

00:23:05.19 don't look at what three is pull it out and put it directly into your mouth

00:23:09.23 because I think like don't smell it just go no that's fair that's fair so this

00:23:14.08 will be your first time having boveril and it's a frozen bob pop potentially

00:23:18.11 yeah potentially I don't know if that's the one that didn't freeze did you go

00:23:22.03 and find bob roll yourself or did my bother will find your bottle never

00:23:25.06 arrived that's what I'm saying as far as packages go I don't know they they we

00:23:28.23 should really check on that I'm assuming

00:23:31.00 amazon delivered they might be lost they couldn't find my door they're missing

00:23:36.13 so I had to go and buy my own bob roll over the weekend and it was easy to find

00:23:40.19 uh I had to go to three grocery stores so I wouldn't say it's the easiest to

00:23:44.11 find but I was able to get it but it existed in your in your town oh it

00:23:48.09 totally exists in my town yeah it wasn't like every store had it but yeah it

00:23:52.02 exists here I I was looking on amazon for bother all there was like one seller

00:23:55.22 and it was like next day prime delivery and on the thing it said imported from

00:24:00.02 Canada so I thought oh if I just turn around and put a Canadian address maybe

00:24:04.18 it'll be quicker but I guess they like pre-imported from Canada to sat in the

00:24:08.11 u.s so I guess to to send it back to Canada

00:24:11.09 has been a real problem because that that stuff's still not meant to limit

00:24:15.20 that's incredible yeah they're lost yeah it just says oh it says deliver today

00:24:21.11 really yeah oh [ __ ] do I have more bob roll on my mailbox oh no

00:24:26.17 I hope I like it oh [ __ ] I can't believe Geoff you had you

00:24:32.15 tried bothering outside of proper face cannon well what uh what else am I going

00:24:38.12 to do I was well listen have it I was it

00:24:41.08 was given to me uh during uh I went to a com all right so

00:24:45.14 well let's do this first before we get into the meaning well this is on

00:24:48.16 andrew's thing you could you could tell a story and then in the middle of the

00:24:52.00 story say four and then I just have to [ __ ] pull okay got it so

00:24:55.03 so I went to england I went to the uk for a week I spent uh like eight days

00:24:59.02 over in London in your neck of the woods

00:25:00.21 gaff by the way London says hi they miss you hello uh that's not that's not true

00:25:04.23 at all and nobody everybody I talk to anyone no they've

00:25:08.12 never heard of you I'm like uh any messages for Gavin and they're like what uh

00:25:14.14 first off bovrel you made it sound like barbel's everywhere in the uk

00:25:19.12 it took me six days before I finally encountered

00:25:23.12 barbaral that's going to sainsbury's wait rose uh

00:25:26.20 tesco all the different groceries have talking to people at stores being like

00:25:31.05 do you guys you know where I could find bob roll and everybody going why would

00:25:35.00 why would you want to find that dude was everywhere I said I found it in a

00:25:39.00 vending machine and a football game I'm not out there buying it in the

00:25:42.12 supermarket it is it's not readily available and

00:25:45.18 when I asked people for it they all all universally said just get vegemite it's

00:25:49.07 way better or just get more money that's way better and I'm like yeah but that's

00:25:51.09 not what I want I want barbell and they're like no you don't and I had to

00:25:54.16 like argue with people and they're like listen you don't want

00:25:57.11 it I'm like I'm telling you I need it for a thing and they're like must be in

00:26:02.13 the supermarket just get marmite so I was there uh for the one of the

00:26:06.08 other podcasts I do the theme park podcast as well as for like a rooster

00:26:11.11 teeth community meet up so during the community meet up uh and I was doing this

00:26:15.16 meet up with uh uh my uh regular fan jack I'm not sure where he is in the

00:26:19.17 hierarchy right now he's called fan fan jack well he's not minor league fan

00:26:23.08 anymore I think I think I think he's up from minor league just right it's a

00:26:26.15 promotion but uh yeah I think so uh and so I was on a panel and somebody came up

00:26:31.06 and gave it to me and it had a bow on it

00:26:33.11 and they put like a little rooster teeth

00:26:35.10 union jack logo on it and they were like

00:26:38.00 here we got this for you and here's some boiling water and here's something to

00:26:41.18 spread it on will you eat it in front of

00:26:44.00 everyone and since it was being filmed I thought yeah it might as well

00:26:47.01 because also I wasn't sure I could bring it back to the states because somebody

00:26:50.17 uh told me that you can't import it to the u.s like you can't bring it from the

00:26:55.03 uk in the u.s so you said you you it was being filmed so you're like yeah no

00:26:59.14 problem do you have that footage uh I think uh I think my girlfriend

00:27:03.06 Emily has so I can give it to you guys I don't have it on me great and what were

00:27:08.08 your thoughts uh so I had it two ways uh apparently

00:27:11.09 apparently the the boy like uh making it like beef bullion kind of boiling it is

00:27:16.08 not the main way I guess people mostly use it as a spread on toast kind of like

00:27:20.23 marmite so I had it that way first yeah oh by the way Andrew uh go ahead

00:27:25.14 and eat number two okay with your eyes closed please

00:27:29.20 while you're doing that I'll upload the photo just for reference

00:27:34.10 of me right before did he keep all the the pups behind it behind him I put it

00:27:38.22 in the fridge and my mic stand is covering the fridge door so I had to

00:27:42.19 slide the mic that was an immense chair creak it just

00:27:46.23 sliding okay so I'm pulling the pop out I'm so nervous I should have like a puke

00:27:52.15 bucket this is okay pop two coming out it is solid

00:27:56.14 try to identify it without opening your eyes yeah oh it's revving up

00:28:06.19 so I've uploaded a photo uh it's on the face Instagram already I think it's of

00:28:12.10 me and by the way a snazzy new regulation listener t-shirt which I

00:28:16.11 think is just very nice uh and there's a regular fan jack in the background and

00:28:20.19 I'm holding the barrel that they gave me uh so the first way I had it was as a

00:28:24.12 spread and I have to say it was [ __ ]

00:28:27.03 heinous like absolutely disgusting if you've

00:28:30.05 ever had vegemite if you've ever had marmite this is just as bad if not like

00:28:36.02 five percent worse I mean just dog [ __ ]

00:28:38.21 just not edible however then I took a teaspoon and of of this

00:28:45.03 goop and I stuck it in the boiling water and I spun it around a little bit and

00:28:49.12 made like the hot bottle cup like you would have at a football game yeah and I

00:28:54.08 give it a I give it a 5.2 out of 10. Okay I said what was the

00:28:58.03 first one dog [ __ ] out of 10 and then 5.2 out of 10. Yeah like I found myself

00:29:02.11 throughout the panel still sipping it a little bit I thought I probably end up

00:29:05.15 drinking ha half of a little Dixie cup full of of bottle uh yeah it's not great

00:29:11.03 but in that form I can see like on a cold day you like

00:29:14.09 you kind of want a little nourishment and to be warmed up I can see in in much

00:29:19.11 the same way maybe you would drink like hot bone broth or like a bullion uh I

00:29:24.16 can see it being uh utilitarian I've never had it as a

00:29:28.08 spread so I'll probably try that at some point but yeah I don't I don't mind it

00:29:34.10 as a hot bathroom also at a glance jack's t-shirt uh in the corner of my

00:29:38.06 eye look like it said anal passage.

00:29:49.20 Eric Eric can you get on that please

00:30:07.09 we gotta do that that's awesome jack would think a glance that way I'm

00:30:13.07 repping the merch but it's really just

00:30:19.09 you know what would be the ultimate will be the ultimate is if we we work it out

00:30:24.02 with his wife so she switches out the annual package in his laundry for an

00:30:28.12 anal passage shirt let's see if we can get him see if we can get him to wear it

00:30:32.13 without knowing he's wearing a passive shirt we would have to move fast on that

00:30:37.11 before this episode comes out yeah which is uh less than a week this is Tuesday

00:30:44.00 Christ we have to like swap the shirt and put

00:30:47.20 it right at the top of the phone okay but we've kind of this is like the bat

00:30:53.09 paranoia he now will have to check his annual pass shirt always he's gonna have

00:30:58.15 to constantly double check that shirt so it kind of works no matter what we've

00:31:02.08 created paranoia

00:31:04.17 oh crap oh eric's already sent it off to the merch team okay

00:31:09.07 so there you go there's your there's your uh seven up uh bob pop oh

00:31:14.08 yeah very clear so you just knocked the top by the looks I did took a bite out

00:31:18.19 of the top of it dodge the bob is a great name for this so I'm just going to

00:31:22.01 steal that Geoff that's fantastic we're trying to dodge the app

00:31:25.14 how on a scale of one to ten how do you rate the sprite pop nine it was way

00:31:31.03 better than I anticipated that was delicious damn I like as well

00:31:35.04 you you've just outright refused to try hot bottle here you've gone straight for

00:31:38.17 the bob pop I've gone straight for the pop pop yeah all right I didn't I guess

00:31:42.10 I could have used the keurig to heat up the bob right isn't that a thing I could

00:31:46.10 have done yeah yeah bob machine ramen and bob exclusively that's what

00:31:51.16 that keurig is for maybe that's dude there should be a bobril flavored ramen

00:31:58.10 that's like the hot new thing above real cake

00:32:01.18 I saw so many videos of people pouring bob roll down the sink after trying it

00:32:10.19 it's it's really honestly hot bottle is not as bad as I thought it would be it

00:32:16.09 is it's drinkable I wouldn't choose it but I I would

00:32:19.14 in much the same way like for people who

00:32:21.11 don't like coffee but need to be need to be warm on a cold day I could see it

00:32:26.02 yeah absolutely doing the trick that makes sense to me yeah saw a few um

00:32:29.21 comment leavers from saint kilda uh saying that they've been on the pier and

00:32:34.08 stuff and it was weird to hear their the place they live mentioned on

00:32:38.07 really the the reach of this podcast yeah it's crazy because that's far away

00:32:43.09 yeah you know what else is interesting talking about the reach so you know I

00:32:48.23 did this panel and there were you know maybe 100 uh

00:32:52.03 gener general rooster teeth community members there right yeah and uh I was

00:32:56.11 surprised how many of them do not listen to this podcast we got to do a better

00:33:01.11 job of convincing people to listen to this podcast oh so not a lot of uh

00:33:04.22 regulation listeners there were more I'd say like maybe half were regulation

00:33:08.18 listeners the other half had no idea what we were talking about

00:33:12.04 they weren't up to date on anal passages [Laughter]

00:33:16.10 just realize we've got some work to do we've got work to do within our own

00:33:20.12 larger community to uh to reach out to those people

00:33:23.21 Eric says shirt is being worked on fantastic just open up the Photoshop file

00:33:29.07 oh dude oh dear uh yeah how do how do we get

00:33:32.19 more people to listen to this or is it better that more people don't it's like

00:33:37.16 our little secret podcast exclusive club good question yeah I

00:33:41.06 don't know I mean animated will come out at some point potentially yeah I feel

00:33:45.09 like that'll be a good reach for people it's kind of tough it's a tough thing to

00:33:49.01 jump into it's funny as I said getting texts from

00:33:51.19 the my hubby's bagels people oh and and speaking that I never said on the show

00:33:56.10 there is a regulation bagel the regulation

00:33:58.19 exists now it is a definitive thing you can order it it's on the menu I did my

00:34:03.22 research I tried a bunch of different combinations of thing

00:34:07.06 the regulation bagel is a bagel I I like it on a cheddar bagel but I guess it

00:34:11.15 could be on any bagel that's especially dependent on availability of the bagels

00:34:15.03 but I would say a cheddar bagel is not regulation as a baby it doesn't doesn't

00:34:19.09 matter this is my regulation bagel this is this is how I've worked this out it's

00:34:24.23 really fresh for the show um it is half of it is the

00:34:27.17 bacon cream cheese that they have and the other half is the garlic and black

00:34:33.11 pepper cream cheese half and half as a sandwich incredible

00:34:37.18 sounds really good it's really [ __ ]

00:34:37.18 good now is this a hot bagel this is you get it toasted there it's your choice I

00:34:43.00 I get a toast okay I asked for a regulation bagel toasted step to the

00:34:47.14 side get my bagel it's fantastic I'd highly recommend it

00:34:52.05 what did it feel like to stand in line and order your own creation for them

00:34:57.07 it's funny you say that Geoff they have sold out every day like they've been so

00:35:02.05 popular it's been amazing like that they've gotten so much love from the

00:35:05.18 community and just uh well our community and just the community in which I live

00:35:09.12 in generally uh yeah they have so much support they're selling out all the time

00:35:13.23 they're lines so I decided I was going to go there super early they opened at 8

00:35:18.08 a.m I left to go there and I was in line at 700 am like I'm gonna be the first

00:35:23.09 person in line they open early and sell all the bagels to you and then everyone

00:35:28.20 in the line was pissed off.

00:35:36.15 I did not have a whole lot of people mad at me

00:35:40.12 this is this is a great face on me though this is the classic so I show up

00:35:44.14 at 700 am when do you think the next person showed up to join this line that

00:35:48.15 I had created 758758743 was the next I spent 43

00:35:54.19 minutes in a line of one 43 minutes just by myself then a couple

00:36:00.17 a couple showed up at 743 they were behind me and then one other group

00:36:06.04 showed up at 752 when we were let in a little bit early they opened up at 752

00:36:11.07 they typically open up at 8. I got there an hour early for a three-person line

00:36:17.01 uh but I I got all my stuff I ordered all the bagels I ordered the holo bread I

00:36:22.23 got the regulation bagel I was so happy it was a great experience ever since

00:36:27.12 they've opened they have sold out every single day by noon the only day they

00:36:32.21 haven't sold out was the day that I showed up at 7 am I

00:36:36.00 think they may have sold out before it closed but it was like they went the

00:36:39.08 whole day with bagels it was just a quiet day the one day that I showed up

00:36:43.10 an hour early it wouldn't matter I could

00:36:45.15 have come earl later in the day how were the line pleasantries ah there was

00:36:50.05 really a non-existent line there were there were nothing talk to the other

00:36:53.09 couple you didn't try to I would have tried to push the regulation bagel you'd

00:36:56.10 be like hey have you guys been here before I hear there's this thing called

00:37:00.00 the regulation base for everybody yeah like a secret I love when you order it

00:37:03.22 in it comes in on the menu as secret regulation bagel is how it's categorized

00:37:07.09 it's fantastic it's been awesome seeing people take

00:37:10.18 photos with their regulation bagels uh it's delicious and uh yeah it's it's

00:37:14.19 great not great lime pleasantries though it

00:37:17.19 was cold I'd been there for like 4042

00:37:21.03 minutes just with shorts it was just freezing I was so cold

00:37:25.03 how how'd the ankles hold up uh you know what I got a little I kind of pulled I

00:37:29.10 pulled something a little bit but we were okay we were fine I was worried I

00:37:33.11 was sitting in front like you kind of walk up to the store and a person walked

00:37:37.03 by with their dog and I thought they were going to go into the line so I was

00:37:40.10 like [ __ ] I need to be in line I want to

00:37:40.10 be the first one in and so I immediately shot up and twisted and I felt like a

00:37:44.16 little tightness and the achilles and I was like I'm a [ __ ] idiot but I'm

00:41:13.22 when I could see it I wasn't sure if it would be frozen coke or bottle and I

00:41:17.16 would probably have assumed that that was the coke a 5050 draw oh

00:42:02.05 [Laughter]

00:42:17.07 How the [ __ ]

00:42:18.23 what a great game oh damn so you had a good time in Europe Geoff I

00:42:25.16 did I had a great time in the uk I did all the it was emily's first time going

00:42:30.23 so we did all the tourist stuff and uh and I did uh saw oh my god have you guys

00:42:36.02 ever seen a musical oh they're pretty cool

00:42:39.14 um yeah I sounded great that's a phantom of the opera

00:42:43.08 uh because I found out that even though my girlfriend I've been dating for

00:42:48.06 almost five years she had been harboring a secret uh that she had never uh never

00:42:53.14 admitted to me and that secret was uh she is the world's largest Andrew Lloyd

00:42:57.08 Webber fan and she can sing every song from every Andrew Lloyd Webber musical

00:43:02.00 so the second she found out we were going to London she got us tickets to

00:43:06.13 see phantom of the opera which I knew nothing about zero zero about

00:43:11.16 and so uh now I know everything about it because I saw it what is it about burn

00:43:16.23 victim yeah it's about a burn victim and a hospital ward yeah and they uh

00:43:21.09 no it's about a phantom who lives in an opera house uh and haunts a play but

00:43:25.20 there's this giant uh chandelier whole thing's about a chandelier basically uh

00:43:30.03 and that's a big moment but at this theater which is the theater that

00:43:33.06 originally it's like the I don't know what it's called like the queen Victoria

00:43:38.04 theater or some [ __ ] and it was uh it's

00:43:41.05 played there every day since like 1984.

00:43:43.03 Uh she bought this like 60 vip experience and because we were

00:43:46.21 the only people who got that experience probably because the play's been out for

00:43:50.19 106 years uh they gave us an upgrade and there's a

00:43:54.06 little room off to the side that was built for queen Victoria when she would

00:43:59.21 go to plays and then uh lady dye apparently was a huge uh phantom fan and

00:44:04.21 so that was the room she would hang out in so we got to hang out in a in a

00:44:08.10 little room uh off to the side by ourselves where it

00:44:11.17 was like real gold on the walls and [ __ ]

00:44:13.20 and I got to use the same toilet that lady Diana used when she would go see

00:44:19.03 phantom of them no I just peed I just don't want to be

00:44:23.07 disrespectful to the crown uh so I just tinkered but uh yeah yeah my

00:44:28.19 I have uh I have uh yeah I have uh hung out in similar uh circles as uh uh

00:44:33.05 British royalty now I've not seen a lot of musicals I saw cats and it was a

00:44:37.00 boring piece of [ __ ]

00:44:38.15 uh mamma mia was better than the movie are we talking no no

00:44:43.03 I'm just asking mamma mia was better because it had abba songs but that was

00:44:47.07 about it I can't do abba not an abba fan what's wrong with abba

00:44:52.02 I have a I have a childhood memory associated to abba and I just can't I

00:44:57.07 can't consume abba I've avoided Adam my whole life it's because

00:45:01.21 go ahead yeah would you uh would you like to I'm willing to talk about it for

00:45:06.17 sure if you wanted do you want to guess uh you were at a wedding uh dancing

00:45:12.10 queen came on no no no it was is but uh there was a kid who

00:45:17.14 threw a birthday party uh at school like he had his birthday party during class

00:45:22.10 hours and he was very physical I don't know but he pulled it off and he

00:45:27.02 was very musical he loved he loved singing and he decided to do a rendition

00:45:32.10 of abba's golden or what was it eyes the I song pretty guy is golden eyes

00:45:37.15 what's the abba song golden eyes angel eyes that's what I was like

00:45:42.04 I just they say angelize a lot that's all I remember about it but but they did

00:45:47.12 a performance of angel eyes in front of the entire class and it did not go well

00:45:52.15 it was one of the most awkward uncomfortable

00:45:54.21 things I've ever had to witness that I felt terrible about and because of that

00:45:59.04 whenever I hear abba I immediately just go to that memory and I just did awkward

00:46:03.22 and uncomfortable so I've not been able to enjoy mamma mia might be tough for me

00:46:08.09 I've avoided mamma mia because of that I don't know angelized by abba

00:46:12.17 I think somebody it was nick just posted a link to angelize yeah it's it's uh

00:46:17.01 I don't know if it's a hit I'm not familiar really with their catalog

00:46:20.04 because of that experience but whenever I hear abba I get taken back to grade

00:46:25.03 four grade four or five watching this rendition of angel eyes and just cringing

00:46:32.00 it did not go well we got to get you back into abba we got

00:46:36.19 to get a abba redemption for you if you give me an ad I'm going to try 10

00:46:41.16 all-time song what is a Fernando yeah Fernando yeah

00:46:45.06 even that has been tainted it's unfortunate that abba's been tainted for

00:46:48.13 me but it's just I can't I can't get around it or at least I haven't been

00:46:51.22 able to yet great band though just I can't can't do it

00:46:56.04 I don't think I've ever seen does it count if you watch like a

00:47:00.02 streamed musical like I went to the theater and watched a streamed version

00:47:05.03 of company when colbert was I think the lead at that time

00:47:09.12 but I've never been to like a proper musical like in the

00:47:13.08 in in the place have you ever been to a musical Geoff is this your first

00:47:16.14 in-person musician uh I've been to a lot of theater in my life but I don't think

00:47:21.05 I've ever been to a musical before yeah I can't imagine the circumstances that

00:47:26.19 would have led me to see a musical by choice up until this moment so

00:47:31.20 yeah I uh this is my first time uh I quite quite enjoyed it though

00:47:36.15 that's great so you're now open to going to like more musicals you're going to

00:47:41.13 become a musical guy potentially uh no for instance a regular fan jack found

00:47:46.14 out we were going to see uh found out we

00:47:48.19 were going to see a phantom of the opera and he said oh it's great I'm going to

00:47:52.07 go see the back to the future musical tomorrow uh you should come with me and

00:47:56.02 I was like it's not going to happen so no I don't think so I think it would be

00:48:00.09 very specific to to share the experience with my girlfriend and only only a

00:48:04.22 musical that she has vetted I don't want to see popcorn that is

00:48:09.14 yeah that's fair I also feel like it's a different thing

00:48:12.02 I'm more interested in seeing a musical that was crafted as a musical as opposed

00:48:16.04 to anything that was adapted from a movie

00:48:19.07 into a musical would it may be amazing but it's just it's that I'm if I'm

00:48:22.22 getting into musicals I want to hit like the the the musical part first instead

00:48:28.17 of yeah well to be fair I think phantom is a was a rendition of a old early

00:48:32.18 1900s movie that was based off a book but it's I mean I think that when you

00:48:36.11 think of phantom of the opera you think of this play there are this musical this

00:48:39.16 Andrew Lloyd Webber absolutely it's synonymous with it so I think he kind of

00:48:43.07 owns that story at this point um but I'll probably see like les mis

00:48:46.23 like apparently my my girlfriend's big on that one so I'll probably have to

00:48:50.17 have to sit through that at some point that's not a bad one I've only seen the

00:48:54.15 movie but it was enjoyable yeah I've seen none of it so it'll be fresh for me

00:48:58.03 I saw the first half of the Gerard butler phantom of the opera I know I

00:49:02.03 didn't finish it though I don't remember anything about it I walked out halfway

00:49:05.17 through and went into fat Albert that was playing at the time that was much

00:49:09.20 more my speed I had a much better time at fat Albert

00:49:14.04 Keenan thompson's live action fight Albert Keenan thompson's gotta be the most

00:49:18.18 mentioned person on this podcast I didn't even think about that

00:49:22.22 I would imagine so yeah uh I wonder if somebody could go do and do

00:49:27.17 a person count it'd be him coolio gets mentioned a lot oh we need to uh we need

00:49:32.21 to guess another for the previously on guy that's a great point I had that my

00:49:37.07 notes do you two have uh any questions you would like to ask before making your

00:49:40.20 guess seeing a lot of comment leavers say it's like Caleb or drew zapplin it's

00:49:45.02 neither of them neither of those I don't

00:49:47.09 I don't think I've ever heard this voice before it sounds like someone from the

00:49:50.17 west coast okay I mean are you just stating that is

00:49:53.23 that a question for me or okay you're just you're speaking out loud I sort of

00:49:58.21 have forgotten the questions I've already asked about it

00:50:03.03 yeah it's rough doing this every couple weeks uh

00:50:06.15 all right gav you go first can I have an official question first

00:50:10.06 I don't know what that means yeah of course you can ask a question and then

00:50:14.17 you can make your guess what season of face are they a part of

00:50:19.03 oh Jesus Christ you expect me to remember the catalog our absurd season

00:50:23.16 system um we're in season four right now correct yeah uh-huh

00:50:28.11 I would assume that they were in season two okay okay pretty early on

00:50:34.02 but I feel like season two went on a long time I feel like that's covering a

00:50:38.03 lot of ground season three was what three episodes so.

00:50:42.23 I don't even think it yeah uh

00:50:48.06 is it um road master 74

00:50:51.14 I don't even who is road master 74. I don't know remember Geoff's saying it

00:50:57.05 no it is not road master 74. Geoff do you have any questions

00:51:02.21 I mean I would like to know who road master 74 even I [ __ ]

00:51:07.20 know that name because you were saying you were like I'm going to say

00:51:11.22 roadmaster74

00:51:13.03 I'm going to keep saying his name roadmaster74 and then you immediately

00:51:16.00 got his name wrong and like the next time you mentioned it

00:51:19.18 uh is it is it somebody who appeared on the uh

00:51:25.22 the face Christmas album no okay oh were they in fluke face you can't ask two

00:51:31.09 questions you already asked you asked earlier remind me to ask that

00:51:36.02 next time okay is it the person who cause I can I can now ask so that was my

00:51:40.08 question now can I make my guess you can make

00:51:44.00 your guess I guess it's uh the person who played Gavin

00:51:47.12 in the fluke face recording that that was a uh a

00:51:51.16 welsh woman yeah so that's that's a no that's a Noah but I appreciate your shot

00:51:57.13 damn.

00:51:59.09 I think you could argue that was the worst guess by far like as well

00:52:04.23 who's arguing.

00:52:08.13 I was gonna say I feel like you asked the same question back to back or Gavin

00:52:12.22 wasn't there's something where one you guys both asked the same question I

00:52:16.01 think that was worse than that no that was one where nick asked the same as oh

00:52:20.01 okay that's what it was yeah nick missed it

00:52:24.08 but while gavin's asking that question why don't you go ahead and eat the

00:52:28.21 fourth pop oh yeah number four oh yeah yeah uh Geoff while andrew's eating that

00:52:34.17 you were a game of thrones fan right yes I was uh no

00:52:38.15 how do you how do you pronounce this name hold on oh no

00:52:43.05 that's Targaryen oh no I don't remember the character from the show I don't

00:52:49.14 either but that's I'm pretty sure it's anus yeah

00:52:54.21 George I might have taken the piss yeah yeah well

00:52:59.16 uh anus Targaryen first of his name

00:53:05.20 only of his name

00:53:09.22 yeah it went uh according to this when aegon

00:53:13.07 Targaryen anus Targaryen and then back to egg and Targaryen

00:53:17.11 so we have a problem family tree is a mess okay

00:53:20.15 I pulled it on frozen I pulled it that looks like sour cream salad cream

00:53:27.12 oh it's all the smell I just got hit with the smell

00:53:31.22 oh it sounded oh scoop it out oh you're gonna have to spoon it I [ __ ] hate

00:53:38.00 you Gavin you're two for two I'm bad Geoffy.

00:53:49.05 [Laughter]

00:53:50.15 Okay I guess I'll try to scoop it out yeah yeah god okay oh this this like

00:53:56.21 it's like soft soft-serve salad cream is that bachelor of salad cream oh is that

00:54:02.04 batter it could be batter but it looks like butter cream

00:54:06.12 a pancake it's pancake batter pancake yeah that's probably quite yummy then

00:54:15.12 look at all the noises are different oh this is gross but it's not bad okay

00:54:22.17 where would you rate it a one two one nine negative six and one mm-hmm

00:54:31.01 this is yeah this is gross but it's not bad like I would

00:54:37.03 the idea once you mentally get past what

00:54:40.10 you're doing it's not it's not the worst so Geoff's still picking good ones then

00:54:46.03 oh god that's right you're welcome we're

00:54:48.12 really not good never mind I did retract everything and said this is horrible

00:54:53.09 oh is this the non-frozen one no oh that's the frozen one so you have uh one

00:55:02.15 and three left or your final final two okay uh gav why don't you take a guess

00:55:09.20 one okay I I [ __ ] hate you so much I hate you

00:55:20.21 this is the one that isn't that isn't frozen so this has to be

00:55:25.18 this has to be salad cream maybe it's like the oil content okay pulling one oh

00:55:33.05 it's so gross

00:55:37.11 it's so gross super too baby thank you Gavin you're a good man oh

00:55:45.11 okay I'm gonna I'm gonna take a photo of

00:55:49.22 on the bright side it'll get that batter out of your mouth

00:55:53.12 oh I don't know if that's a positive I think I'd rather have the batter oh

00:55:58.21 it looks like tapioca pudding oh that's so bad it's so translucent at the edges

00:56:04.13 oh it's horrendous that's the salad cream hideous oh when were these frozen

00:56:11.05 uh yesterday so this is that's been frozen all night oh god
